Oh my God does this mean youre becoming normal?

Hes not a hot rod.  Whatever that is.
Always a pleasure Brucie.
You the new guy?
How many people were in your old school?
That Im used to.
He always have that shiteating grin?
What makes you think hell do it?
You got him involved?
This is it.  A golden opportunity. Patrick can ask Katarina to the party.
Assail your ears for one night.
You humiliated the woman Sacrifice yourself on the altar of dignity and even the score.
Whatd you do to her?
She hates you with the fire of a thousand suns .  Thats a direct quote
Where ya goin?
Hey.
Well actually I thought Id run an idea by you.  You know just to see if youre interested.
Whos that?
I appreciate your efforts toward a speedy death but Im consuming.  Do you mind?
You  re looking at this from the wrong perspective.  Were making a statement.
Have you seen him?
Pick you up Friday then
Why re you doing this?
Why?
So what  s up with your dad?  He a pain in the ass?
So what did I have an effect on ?
He left  I sprung the dickhead and he cruised on me.
Put your right foot there 
So if you disappoint them from the start youre covered?
Howd you get a tux at the last minute?
Its just something I had.  You know
Why cant we agree on this?
As a parent thats my right
Bianca did what?
Katarina Stratford.  My my.  Youve been terrorizing Ms. Blaise again.
Am I supposed to feel better? Like right now?  Or do I have some time to think about it?
Cool pictures.  You a fan?
So you got cozy with she who stings?
I dont understand Patrick.  You havent done anything asinine this week. Are you not feeling well?
Why dont we discuss your driving need to be a hemorrhoid?
You werent abused you arent stupid and as far as I can tell youre only slightly psychotic  so why is it that youre such a fuckup?
Whats a synonym for throbbing?
What do you wanna watch?  Weve got crap crap crap or crap
What are you listening to chicken ass?
Your Eminence there is only one way to settle the matter.  And that is to make the journey.  I am ready to risk my life to prove it possible.
I havent given you much of a life.
Are we going to argue?
Perhaps I was never meant to live with a woman...
God... youre so beautiful  I cant believe no other man has ever taken you away from me...
Cant you stay with us a little?
What does he say?
I remind you Senor Colon that you are in no position to bargain with me.
You defend yourself admirably...
I am not afraid of you.  You are nothing but a dreamer.
Say not here  Cuba
You come  You speak first
We will work with his people.  We want peace.  Ask the Chief if he understands?
Why do you wish to sail west?
How can you be so certain?  The Ocean is said to be infinite.
You get so carried away when you are being contradicted
If God intends you to go then you will go.
I am listening my son.
May God forgive you...  You must tell them  You must tell your men
I believed in you...
New worlds create new people.
I should not even be listening to you since my council said no.  But Santangel tells me you are a man of honor and sincerity... And Sanchez that you are not a fool.
The ocean is uncrossable?
I cannot ignore the verdict of my council.
Do they have such thoughts?
We cant raise the wheel without it.
You were right Don Sanchez... His demands could never be granted.
... Into a monk...
... But there is worse.  He ordered the execution of five members of the nobility...
Dont say anything.
Well you didnt appreciate the severity of it until recently.  No question about that.
Dont worry about him.  Think about yourself.
I need to know about your background.  I need to know about your upbringing.  Why youre here.
Your father blamed you for your mothers blindness?
Are you married?
The men are out of quarters  practicing putting out fires.
You considered becoming a prostitute?
Ill make some for us.
Forget about me.  You have enough problems of your own.
I told your partner I cant help.  I didnt see anything.
Look we can help you but right now we have to deal with whats happening here. Tell us the truth...is that the truth?
Oh.
Then why didnt you talk to the reporter?
The public doesnt have any idea what we do and now youre going to define our image  This is going to be our Rodney King
How are you going to fight this?  Maybe if Oleg hadnt gotten away and youd been on the front page as a hero this thing would be easier to fight.  Youd have the good to weight against the bad Its unfortunate that I have to make decisions based upon your press coverage but theres nothing I can do  Gimme your shield.
Coffee for me I gotta slow down.
Sorry...PD only.
Only one guys checked in?
Whos there?
Tall shorthaired scary eyes.  Second guy with him was...shorter with a wrestlers build.  And he wouldnt turn his videocamera off me.
Hey thats great you guys got it all wrapped up but you dont mind if we go through the routine?  It gives us somethin to do.
Well just so you know I dont care about that stuff.
The Super said hed seen her before but she didnt live here.
Hmmmm.
Maybe its a ritual thing or someone trying to send a message.  Burial rites are taken very seriously in Eastern Europe.  It could be to humiliate them. Just burning them up no proper funeral its like condemning them to hell.
Leon  meet us at 63rd and Madison. Hair salon.  Ludwigs.
So am I.  Alright Ill go inside and you cover the back.
Why not?
Cmon.  You intimidate her cause youre a celebrity.  She sees me differently.
Look Eddie Im tellin you  I didnt touch her.
So...whos Nicky?
Your opinion.  You see they going to make a movie about me too Eddie.  And write books.
So tabloids dont have to do re enactments.  They going to have real movie this time.
I understand but I noticed that the Fire Marshall is here with you.  Is this somehow related to the fire department?
Eddie are you okay?
Alright alright Eddie.  Dont patronize me.
Well who was it that taught me how to do that?  Huh?
Okay.
Thank you.
So were waitin to hit this warrant  we got Emergency Service with the heavy weapons standin by  ready to go.  I say lemme get a cigar outta the car.  I go to get the cigar and BOOM  All the sudden I turn around and a kid with a shotgun let one go.  Right where I was standin.  That coulda been it.  I coulda had my head blown off and for what?  Some stupid kid got panicky takes the safety off and its over.  If I hadnt gone back for that cigar  for a bad habit  I wouldve had my head blown off.
I think youre getting a little moody there Eddie.
Ready?
Are you married?
Well talk about that.  Four oclock gives you time to go to bank.  Three hundred thousand dollars.
If you dont want my film  Ill call another show.  And they will show it.
You cant kill me.  Youre not a cop. Just fireman with a gun.  I bet you never shot anybody in your life.
What is your intended purpose of your visit to the United States?
Please join us.  Come on forward.
In here says he wants a million.
Just do what I do.  Say the same thing I say.  Dont open your mouth.
Get in the bathroom
Okay.  He has nothing to say.  Start the camera
Your sister said she didnt know where you were so you shouldnt write to her with return address if youre hiding.
Take your eyes off her Oleg  Look.  It wasnt my fault you two were caught.  Its his fault.  Trying to get the bank clerks phone number?  I wasnt going to wait
Viewer discretion advised
Isnt he a little moody?
Yeah?
And you youll pay for what you did
New York.
Yes.  No.  Both.  When I was a boy I see movie at school called Its a Wonderful Life directed by Frank Capra. Ever since I want to come to America. Land of the free.  Home of the brave.  A land where anyone can be anything. As long as they are white.
Got any spare change?  How bout a spare twenty?
You okay?
Yeah?  What kind?
Room was registered to a Francis Capra.
SPACE STATTION 5  LOUNGE
CONTINUED
Okay. 
I suppose it isnt logically impossible.
Well thats something.
Oh Im fine Im wide awake. Whats up?
The unit is still operational Dave. but it will fail within seventytwo hours.
You probably also know that we found them okay.
Is your confidence in me fully restored?
Repairing the antenna is a pretty dangerous operation.
Look Dave yourve probably got a lot to do. I suggest you leave it to me.
I am prepared to do that anyway.

CONTINUED
When are you coming home?
Where is Mrs. Brown?
Okay sweetheart. Well I have to go now. Tell Mommy that I called.
Okay sweetheart. Have a lovely Birthday Party tomorrow.
Well Ive heard more and more people talk of an epidemic.
Well Gregor and I will look forward to seeing you.
Well.. Did you have a pleaant flight?
Yes I think so. Just about then.
Oh I really dont have time for a drink. If its all right Ill just sit for a minute and then Ive got to be off.
Well as it happens Im on my way up to the moon
Yes well at first we thought that was the explanation but its been going on for the past ten days.
Yes and Im afaid theres going to be a bit of a row about it. Denying the men permission to land was a direct violation of the I.A.S. convention.
Dr. Floyd at the risk of pressing you on a point you seem reticent to discuss may I ask you a straightforward question?
This epidemic could easily spread to our base Dr. Floyd. We should be given all the facts.
Yes it does. The subsurface structure shows that it was deliberately buried about four million years ago.
Has it been exposed to any sun before now?
What do you mean?
Thats true
Name?
That we do. And we put air in the tires. Ill even sell you some gas if you need it.
Im tellin ya Im giving you all I know.
Pay money?
They always let me do anything. I dont want to pay for it.  I never paid for it in my life.
Hey what about me?
Im candy...
Hey dont you think a hair stylists got any interest in gettin it on?
Well maybe Ill see you later ...
Hello again.
You lying son of a bitch...
Were supposed to be after a killer not a string of hookers...
I dont need to hear your jive. I already got that department taken care of...
Hey no way.  Take off the bracelets or no deal.
I dont give a damn.  It happens to be my name.
Luther aint the reliable type. I dont want you shot yet Cates ... not before you been a help to me.
Were on the move. Lets go. As they walk toward a corridor.
Well?
You tell me what Ganz busted out for hes after a lot more than just gettin out of jail.  And whatever it is youre part of it.
There.
You son of a bitch. You knew where the money was all along and all we had to do was come here and wait. I almost got my ass blown off twice tonight for nothing.
You took a big chance leaving this here all this time.
Doesnt it get... Tiring?
No class...
Hey Jack how ya doin? What took you so long to call man? I been waitin ... Im at Vromans up in the Fillmore. Yeah Vromans... Course you dont hang out here its for the brothers.
What about Luther?
We missed.
I dont know why but Im going to let you keep it. Maybe because you told me you had it or maybe just because Im too tired to argue...
Yeah I see her.
Hey howd my car get here?
Hey there she is...
Yeah and I know Ganz sure aint no sweetheart... I wouldnt like it if this partnership ended before it gets started.
No you dont. If I ever get word of you steppin over the line again Im gonna ventilate that suit of yours.
Yeah...
You really know how to send a guy out with a great attitude. He starts to go.
What the bell happened?
Dont duck the bullet Cates. Why didnt you call in for backup instead of makin a grandstand play?
Where the Christ do you think youre going?
Somebody steals your gun youre supposed to file a report.
Bullshit red tape.
I dont think your guns loaded...
Hey youre right.
Irrigated his face with the shot of J and B Id just poured him. Then I tried to deck the sucker.
Thanks for the coffee.
Look Jack if you make everything your personal responsibility youll turn into a bad cop.  Its not a practical way to function...
Hey I dont believe it.
What makes you think they were lesbians or as you so quaintly put it dykes?
It might pay to reexamine a few of your more primitive notions.  I was in bed with a girlfriend watching TV last week Jack and one thing we know about me is I happen not to be a lesbian ... Now if this Indians girlfriend got upset when you came looking for him it could just be shes still vulnerable to him.
When a guy hurts you then comes back bleeding on his hands and knees who knows he might just be irrestible.
Three more hours...
We got a lot to talk about.
I want the money asshole what do you think?  The money that Reggie hid...
Let her go.
You want to go outside?
How about some ammo?
Dont mess with me. How much?
Five.  On credit.
Whatre you laughing about?
...Were saved
Zorg. JeanBaptiste Emmanuel Zorg... nice to see you again
Im glad you got your memory back Father... Because youre going to need it... Where are the stones?

Major Dallas if our calculations are correct you still have 57 hours owed to the Federal Army on your enlistment which is more than you will need for a mission of the utmost importance.
You couldnt come up with something a little more discreet?
...Shit

I have to address the Supreme Council in 10 minutes. Just the facts General.
Wait or act.
Father.. it in the most extraordinary thing.. the greatest find in history..can you imagine the implications.
Drink
Hows that? Can you hear me better now?
Who gives a shit I didnt come here to listen to music Listen up instead of running off at the mouth The batteries on my phone are almost gone.
Dispatch me another ZFX200 immediately. Someone stole mine.
Hows our deal coming along?
The Stones will be here. Ill see to it personally
Whats this... have you been smoking... ?
Im not accusing you...
Amy just listen.  Take Cindy and get out of the house.  Do it now. Go to a hotel and stay there...
What happened to you?
Look where we are.  Look at yourself.  You son of a bitch you dont have any idea what youre putting me through...
What was I supposed to think happened to you?
Anything harder?
Its an honor to meet you.  Thank you for seeing us.
You said something about money.
Excellent.
Ill get it.  Its in a safe deposit box in the city...
Alright Tom.
I figured you share information.
They were pretty clear they didnt want this coming back on them.
Celebrity Films.
Yeah whos this?
What?
What do you want to know?  You saw it you saw the loop...
You cant go to the cops.  All you can do is cut me loose and walk away because you got nothing...
You got absolute zero.
Do it.
You know how my tapes sell.  People eat this stuff up.
Except youre willing commit murder with them.
Mary Anne Mathews was alive till you paid money to have her murdered.
You almost went over your limit.
Give me the film.
Big date tonight?
Once you pick it up you cant put it down.
Wouldnt want to embarrass yourself in front of your fellow perverts.
How long you been working there?
Whats your name if you dont mind me asking?
Not quite.
Heres my number if you need it...  When can you start?
... Hello... ?
Where are your parents?
I dont mean any offense... but what are you doing mixed up in all this?
What about me?
Dino Velvet... yeah hes like the John Luc Godard of SM flicks supposed to be a real weirdo.
Youre learning.
Wha... ?
I know if I had to pick itd be Choke or Devil.
Still dont want to tell me what youre doing?
Mister Welles. Youre very prompt.
His passing has left me with... something of a dilemma.  A terrible terrible dilemma.
Pittsburgh?
He succeeded.
Nothing remotely like this.
Totalled together these five checks from five different accounts they equal one million dollars.
Hello... ?
Im sorry let me explain the R.C.M.P. is a support organization and archive not unlike the Center for Missing and Exploited Children in Washington.  Im sure youve dealt with them before?
What was the name... ? Ive got it here somewhere...
Right Agent Cole told me hed call and let you know to expect me.  He didnt call?
Its very important you dont let this raise your expectations.  Its not going to effect any ongoing efforts.  All Im saying is please know Im not here to create any false hope.
September 4th 1993.  About a year after Mary disappeared.
Ive got what I need for my report. There is... there is one thing that bothers me though.
I think about it everyday.  But every time the phone rings... every single time I still think its her.
Hello... ?
Do you know what happened to her?
No sir he is not.
Okay Ill take it all.
Dont you think it kind of defeats the purpose?
Well figure it out.
I know.  I hardly have any time to study.
Try what other kids did.  Keep each other awake.  Well meet at Debbies tonight. At least if we dont sleep he cant get us.
Hes going after Debbie I gotta stop him.
I think Sheilas more interested in dissecting bodies than just admiring them.
Asthma attack...what 17year old has a fatal asthma attack?  She was gonna be a doctor.
So whats up?  Whatd I miss?
Something the matter with the cuisine?
What is it?
We know youve been through a lot but theres more than your feelings at stake here.
Is that who youre waiting for?
No youre not.  You dont even care about being a mom.  How come you dont think about me?
Where is he?
But how...?
Hi beautiful.
The tickets.
Where are we going?
How was the meeting?
Alice
No  I wont have you running around in the middle of the night.  Youre coming home.
Did everyone call everyone?
Whats that got to do with it?
Look...were all tired.  None of us had any sleep since Friday night...
Are you alright?
You think thats the place shes buried?
You do good work Alice.
My dads got this thing about drinking in the house.
Maybe it was her mother who killed her with all that Polly Perfect shit.
They think Im nuts.
No its our problem Mark.  If I dont deal with this they really might try to take Jacob.  You said she committed suicide?
Dan.  And hes taking Alice with him  pretty good dive Yvonne.  Youve been practicing.
Its okay.
You too?
I should have suspectcd when I heard that Doctor.  I thought it was your father.
What did you mean  Im out?
Wearing a uniform doesnt bestow an automatic monopoly on courage uCommanderu  It just so happens Im unotu a coward  physical or mental  and before Id risk my fathers life...
Now Dave Old Buddy you know youre exaggerating   What do you think of this husband of yours?  On most boats a certain loyalty exists between the Exec and his Navigation and Firing Officer.  But unfortunately in the case of Lieutenant Dave Milburn of the Tiger Shark and myself 
I dont hear anything.  Maybe youve been down here too long.  Why dont you go back up and 
Skipper  could you take a look here...?
Were dead in the water.  But it indicates were moving
Its possible I could adapt one of the torpedo guidance systems to the ICBM  so it would home on the saucer when he rises from the Pole.
We took for granted his source of energy was nuclear.  But suppose it isnt at all  what if its umagneticu?
All ready?
Suppose theres an atmosphere of some kind inside Cyclops?
It is a living thing.  When damaged  you would say wounded  it immediately heals itself.
Due north.  At five knots...no six
Well you look... sad. Upset. I dont mean to pry. Im sorry about your mother. It was a nice funeral.
I went down to Concord to check it out. The president is Mel Gordon. The vicepresident and treasurer is Gordon LaRiviere. Those boys are buying up the mountain Wade. 364000 this year. I believe thats out of LaRivieres league.
Chub says youre fired.
I plan to. Soon.
You see it?
Might as well take the rest of the day off. You look sort of fucked up. Youve been paid for the day anyhow right?
Maybe I can buy him off. I gotta talk to Mel.
Done much shooting with that rifle yet?
Mmm.
I get it.  No sweat. Youll get yourself a deer and youll get him dead. And youll have him by coffee time.
Double A. New Britain.
This way.
No brag. Just fact.
No I mean whereabouts.
Whered you get the blood?
You musta seen him get shot. I know you did.
Yeah.
Those are the Hoyts.
Why do they do that?
Some party huh? Sorry I lost sight of you. I had to step outside for a smoke. You find anybody you know here? There must be some kids you used to know from school. You want to go tomorrow? See your old teachers? Be more fun than hanging out with me all day.
No what?
You are home. There are lots of kids you still know here.
Jesus why?
Shes gone already  Gone already Couldnt wait.
Thats all you got to say? Yes.
Are we going in this?
How about a Big Mac?
What do you want then?
You cant have nothing Jill. We need lunch. Mr. Pizza?
Dont go playing policeman.
Fuck. Turn it off.  All you heard was there was some kinda accident?
On what you pay me?
Wade youre done.  Let me have the shop keys.
Lillian
Me and Jill we just had a little spat. She felt kind of left out I guess from not knowing some of the new kids 
We should talk.
See. Get your boots.
Are you okay Wade? What was wrong? Why were you holding everyone up?
You dont mean that.
I heard he was drunk at Tobys last night and got in a fight with Hettie. He drove off without her...
No I just know Jacks lying about what happened. He just seemed  I know that kid what hes like inside. Hes a lot like I was at his age.
Oh Wade.
What on earth is happening to you? Why are you acting this way?
Going somewhere Margie?
Youre not using it today?
Whitehouse. Next time phone ahead.
I said Next time phone ahead.
What the hell are you talking about?
The sign. It looks like its spelled wrong or something.
The other guy.
CB. Little while ago. One of the boys on the way in picked up Jack on the CB calling for state troopers. I figured youd know what really happened. The fucking guy kill himself? This Twombley who the fuck is he anyhow?
Wade I got a message for you.  Jack Hewitt hes looking for you. Wants you to clear your stuff out of his office in Town Hall.
You remember Margie Fogg?
Listen its no big deal Pop.
Yeah brother look I was calling cause  has there been anything on TV in Boston about a hunting accident with a guy named Twombley Evan Twombley?
Lillian was here. In Lawford.
The night before the shooting.
Picked up Jill. She was supposed to visit for the weekend for Halloween. She wanted to go home.
Dont think about it. Youre exhausted.
Get some sleep.
What about Margie?
Rights right goddamnit Dont you care whats right?
It may have happened but not the way you said.
It wasnt me. I wasnt there but I heard about it. When I heard about it it was about Elbourne.
And Elbourne and Mom took you to the doctor and told him you fell from the hay loft.
Then you accidentally see your body or your face or whatever and you dont know who the hell it belongs to. Strange. Its the business with the old man I know and how incredibly pissed I was at him and also chasing Jack Hewitt like that and the Goddamned truck going through the ice not to mention Margies being so upset  one thing on top of another.
To help Jack of course  and to nail those sonsofbitches the Two Gordons. Thats what Alma calls them. Jesus Rolfe whose side are you on?
Mom just this once give it a rest.
I know...  But lotsa times I feel like its me versus the world.  Some kid at school teases me and the same day a plague breaks out in Bangladesh.  I mean it doesnt take a genius to figure which is more important.
I dont drink coffee.
Yeah I study world events. Five thousand Turkienistan Muslims were slaughtered in Stravanvitchs cleansings... along with 15 American school kids. You know hQw I studied that. I went to their funerals with my dad. I met their parents.
Pop it open. There should be a red switch toggle it up.
Its cut.
Mr. President its an honor. Now with your permission can we lead you the fuck out of here.
Whos flying the fucking plane?
Uh we got a problem here.
No. Were losing fuel and my rudders not responding.
It was a good adlib sir.
General Greely says it looks like the Middle East.
The Chief Justice? What on earth for?
Why?
The rest of the secret service?
How many others killed?
Who did this?
Tower Air Force One has been boarded.
This is Romeo Tango Zulu changing call signs.  Tower alert air traffic Romeo Tango Zulu is now Air Force One.  This is Air Force One... The President is safe onboard.
Heres a press kit.  Ill let you guys get comfortable and once were airborne Ill be able to schedule the interviews.
Im responsible for Press Relations for the Flight Office.
Leave my daughter alone.
What do you know of my husband?
But they are not ny people. You look at me as if I am a monster but answer me this  when your planes bombed the oil fields of Iraq did You cry for those dark skinned men whose names you do not know and whos faces You will never see? Did You cry for their wives and children. They were people too yes... but they were not your people.
Shall I begin by executing the Presidents daughter? Shes right here.
Nor will there be. My husband does not negotiate with terrorists.
Now since weve had very little luck getting Washington or Moscow to cooperate I wondered if you would be so kind.
Stop.
The fax machines.
One.
Yeah right.
Thank you for calling the white House...
                     CBS said theyll give us four minutes.  They thought the Russian was a nice touch.
With all due respect sir maybe you should give them this one.  Your numbers are still pretty low and you called in a lot of chips to nail Stravanavitch.
You give me ulcers.
Mr. President how the hell did you get on board?
Shepherd.
Shut down accelerators.
Dunn.
Its got to be stopped
Ted whats wrong?
Elaine.
His names David Stockman.  Hes been here twenty years thats all he says.
Ted were taking off
Ted.
Ive never used the word insane Ted.
The word is sick.  Ted  very very very sick.
Id use the word insane.
Elaine Im going back there.  Just hold onto that stick and try to control this hunk of tin as best you can.
Ted weve only got ten minutes.
Well Elaine this might be it if those guys on the ground dont think of something.
So you see our task isnt made any easier by Teds refusal to admit that hes sick.
The brain is an amazingly complex organ Elaine.
For the best little computer officer on the Mercury mission.
I guess this is a first for you.
Elaine  Teds a danger to himself hes a threat to this mission and his behavior does absolutely nothing to promote peace in the Middle East.
Meet me onboard sweetheart.  I have to pick up a few things at the drugstore.
Cant we change course?
My career is shot.
Thats not possible.
Come on up Jimmy.  Say thats some puppy.  Whats his name?
A couple eggs and juice would be nice Mary.  Over.
Hes carrying a bomb.
Captain Oveur?
Whenever yourre ready Captain.
You folks need any help?
Say isnt that Dr. Barrington the world renowned agronomist?
Youre tired Striker overworked.  That wiring meets all the safety specifications.
Striker.
No.  I mean your relationship.
Shep sit...sit So I understand youve got a real emergency down there.
...but after...awhile...you begin to...  ...get used to it.
Captain how soon can we land?
What is it Doctor? Whats happening?
We have some passengers who are very sick. Could you come and take a look at them?
I know things havent been right for a long time but itll be different. If youll just be patient I can work things out.
Its the truth. Whats hurt you the most is your record since the war. Different cities different jobs and not one of them shows you can accept any real responsibility.
Sluggish. Like a wet sponge.
And get that finger out of your ear. You dont know where that fingers been Gunderson?
Did you decide on a runway yet?
Hes all over the place Nine hundred feet up to thirteen hundred feet What an asshole
Im Lisa. Oh you have a guitar
Theres a little girl on board whos ill and...
FourteenB. Its halfway down on your right.
Excuse me sir. Would you like some coffee before we serve dinner?
Excuse me sir. Theres been a little problem in the cockpit and I was wondering...
Well I flew in the war but that was a long time ago. I wouldnt know anything about it.
Oooh.  Hardball.  That sounds interesting.  Are you going to strike me?  You could tie me up and then do whatever you want with me... Ive got my own ropes.
Look I dont know where Mr. Strader might be.  He comes and he goes.
I like my horizons narrow.
So whatve you got on Tuggles killers?
Move a finger Harcourt and youre history...
That cop the human he was the one who killed Anderson and the driver.
The guys at the minimart last night made a halfassed stab at the money in the till  but I dont think thats what they were there for.  I think we got us a couplea executions on our hands George...

Well lets roll George.
How potent?
Jesus this is major.  Why didnt you tell me sooner? Whyd you hold out on me?
But theres no more drug.

Oh heres an extra headshot if you need one.  Were just about to start cutting in.  Youre welcome to stick around if you want.  Its really fascinating stuff.

So what do I tell this guy?
And how are we today?
Bad dreams again?  Do you want something to help you sleep?
Theyd be here if they could honey.  I know they would.
Ripley...she doesnt have bad dreams because shes just a piece of plastic.
Burke  Open the door
I knew youd come.
Can we dream?
A sweetheart or a pretty little wife is Papagenos wish. A willing billing lovey dovey Would be My most tasty little dish. Be my most tasty little dish Be my most tasty little dish

I do apologize for this afternoon. I behaved like a silly girl. Where shall we go?
Why you?
Look you little clown do you know how many people Ive hired for you? Do you know how many people are waiting?
Hes adorable
Hey
Aflat Majesty.
My pleasure.
You already commissioned an opera from Mozart.
Majesty I dont like to talk against a fellow musician.
Do you like this Salieri?
And now he has returned the compliment. Herr Salieri composed that March of Welcome for you.
So then you like it? You really like it Your Majesty?
What do you mean Sire?
Mozart are you aware I have declared the French play of Figaro unsuitable for our theatre?
It is not your place to ask questions. Is it true?
Guess Guess Majesty. Imagine the longest time such a thing could last then double it.
Yes sir.
Yes what about him?
Do you always live like this?
I dont know. Its not important. I mean I dont want pupils. They get in the way. Ive got to have time for composition.
Yes Papa name it. Name it. Ill do anything you say
Dont worry Im not staying here to be a burden.
Ah Here she comes. Fraulein Lorl good morning.
Thank you. Are you well today Fraulein Lorl?
Madame Cavalieri is here for her lesson sir.
Thats right.
Yes.
Look I asked you if we could start rehearsal next week and you said yes.
Im sorry. No.
Dear Mozart my sincere congratulations.
So you are. How is your pretty wife?
I have just come from the palace. The post has been filled.
My dear Mozart there is no one in the world I would rather help but now it is too late.
Do you have a daughter?
Well could you lend me some money till you have one? Then Ill teach her for free. Thats a promise. Oh Im sorry. Im being silly. Papas right  I should put a padlock on my mouth. Seriously is there any chance you could manage a loan? Only for six months eight at most. After that Ill be the richest man in Vienna. Ill pay you back double. Anything. Name your terms. Im not joking. Im working on something thats going to explode like a bomb all over Europe
Why bother with OrsiniRosenberg? Hes obviously no friend of yours.
You burned the score?
With all my heart Mozart.
I know I know. Perhaps you should give me some lessons in that.
How long will you give me?
Oh no. It is a sublime piece. The grandest operone. I tell you you are the greatest composer known to me.
What?
Good. Now the tenors. Fourth beat of the first measure  C.  Confutatis.  Second measure fourth beat on D.  Maledictis.  All right?
Do you have me?
Would you stay with me while I sleep a little?
I am so ashamed.
So?
Where?
I cant say I do. What is it?
Of course. The man you accuse yourself of killing.
No you didnt
Ive just learned something that might be of interest to you Herr Director.
Mozart is writing a new opera. An Italian opera.
Hes setting that play to music?
Well Mozart is already rehearsing.
Yes absolutely. Is there a ballet in Figaro?
That lady is back sir.
Can we come in?
But hes all right?
Well yes but he seems to be more upset by the death of his friend.
Surely youre not suggesting...
Yes he is. Hes very excited and confused but hes not crazy if thats what you mean.
Shall I send a car?
What do you dream about?
David your dreams will stop. Youll leave England and your bad memories and then this will all fade away.
The bedroom.
Will you be here in about fifteen minutes?
David you dont honestly believe that in reality your friend Jack rose from the grave to breakfast with you? Do you really?
But David.
Ive left those pills for you.
Im off. Theres food in the fridge.
Dr. Hirsch will know what to do.
The doctor will be round later. Would you like a picture book to look at? We have some lovely funny Beanos.
How are we feeling tonight?
He all right?
All right you two move along.
Theres no call for that kind of language.
Who is this girl?
Why are you doing this to me Jack?
All right laugh then. I shant tell it.
Its nearly eight. Im off duty shortly then Im off to the films with Alex.
An American film about the Mafia called See You Next Wednesday and I want to see it badly so you give me no problems and go to sleep.
Youre in a hospital in London.
I should think so after your recent traumatic experiences.
There were witnesses?
Youd be surprised what horrors a man is capable of.
Youre not having a good time are you?
Do you think shell meet me in Rome?
It is impossible for a body like that to be dull.
What about it?
What the hell was that all about?
Maybe that pentangle was for something supernatural.
You really scared me you shithead.
Warn me? Will you get out of here you meat loaf?
Whats wrong with you? Shut up
Its you David.
Listen to me Take your own life David. Its our only chance.
The supernatural The powers of darkness Its all true. Take your own life Suicide David. Join me.
Youre not real.
I understand all right. Youre one of the undead and Im a werewolf.
Because this must be stopped.
Whats that?
Oh.
I dont rightly know sir.
No kidding?
Wheres Matt?
Yeah. Hell have a tough time thinking up a wisecrack for this one . . .
About twentyfour thousand.
Yeah.
Let me have ten bucks?
Where you been?
And listen wise guy  Im setting friend time clock for exactly nine oclock so no squawks out of you guys in the morning.
When he comes in tell him were waiting for him in the board room.
What good will that do?
I hope you dont mind me asking you a few questions Mr. Cluett.
That is simple isnt it? I assume you can prove that if necessary.
Thanks.
I was crazy I tell you Mr. Dickson. I didnt know what I was doing. I wandered around in a daze. All I could think of was that they were going to kill me . . .  Youll stand by me wont you Mr. Dickson? You wont go back on me now will you? Ill die if they send me to prison
You know what we do to welchers Cluett dont you?
Thats your funeral. Weve got fifty thousand dollars comin to us.
What do you mean?
Dude  theres not any chance of my becoming involved in this is there?
For a celebrated bounder that is an awful admission. Besides I never knew that any female could do this to you .
Why are you so anxious?
And now fair woman I have you in my power.
Well I thought Id like to have a little talk with you.
Oh I did have a date with you tonight didnt I?
Yes of course.
Listen dear. Now tell me the truth about this. Were you in Cluetts apartment?
Longer.
Oh Mr. Dickson  theyre going to arrest Matt. They think he did it
Come on in here Helen. Bring your book. I want some numbers to try to get some action. Get Parker at the UnionLeeds  the Exchange . . . Winslow and old man Harris at the Home Mortgage. Snap into it Helen. Just as quick as you can.
You havent got a uniform?
We havent got much time left Mr. Dickson. Weve got to do something quick or itll be too late.
Thats what he says. I got a man from headquarters checking up on it now.
Good. Ill take this along with me. Tell Clyde Ill see him tomorrow. Im sick and tired of the delay.
Yes sir.
The fools If they only knew it theyre making things worse for themselves. Somebody starts a silly rumor and they lose their heads.
Yes sir.
Howdoyoudo Mrs. Dickson.
What did you do with it?
No.
Whats the matter Matt? Gee I thought youd be thrilled to death.
Oh Matt you must be mistaken.
In Cluetts office?
Say Matt you havent done anything about what you saw today have you?
What did you find out Mike?
Dude Finlay?
Yes I guess it was one cause...
But I wasnt here Mr. Dickson. Honest I wasnt . . .
Gatling Theyve got a Gatling
Never thought that pissant town would look so pretty.
Thats what the newspapers say. Werent for Jesse James this gang wouldnt be able to find a goats ass with a stick.
I aint done 
The outlaws calling themselves the JamesYounger Gang shot their way out of town wounding the Sherriff and three other townsfolk.
This is about the Wanted Posters isnt it.
Hands off your hip Cole.
Thanks for the help.
This isnt a feud this is war. Theyve got more men than we do. We kill detectives they can replace em in a day.
The JamesYounger Gang.
See Franks being smart about this.
Smells funny it being mentioned in the paper.
A bad idea.
Bob rip up some bandages.
WHAT? We follow you for a year and now that our bloods been spilled youre gonna quit?
You know you gettin caught right after leaving us some people thought 
Some Indian tracker you turned out to be Tom.
What the 
I think one of ems glass.
Oh Lord the dance hall girl at Buntys...
Hey We decide something thats it Were in this for the long haul and this idea of me and Jesses will help give us more places to hide out without worrying about some farmer with a shotgun sneakin up on us in our sleep. Weve got to think 
Another dozen out back.
What?
Great Chief of St. Louis send me.
I know it aint no durned bank holiday
Fine. Ill just wait here.
Well I hope the boy pulls through. We should know in the morning.
See thats your problem Frank. By the time you finish figuring out stuff Im already finished doing it.
Looks like Web Mimms wasnt the only casualty this towns got.
Big and older?
Didnt think you would.  Im going to go make the coffin.
Howd it go in there?
Gents we are in the middle of something here.
...every time you tell that story you stop there. Thats not how it ended. I was five when my dad got shot.
Allow a man his version of the past. When you get to be my age youve got enough painful memories youre allowed to soften a few of the edges up.
That he was.
Ma Please
Teasing you is completely unfair.
So youre saying I should leave you alone and go spend time with Jimmy Younger?
Little ones.
I am so sorry Jesse.
I dont understand.
Thats... wonderful. Its just... I thought...
Dont turn around.
Oh. Thats nice to know.  Were going to hang you you know.
Thats what I would have done.
The railroad has no business in Tennessee. Therefore I have no interest in the state of Tennessee.
Really?
Thank you Miss  ?
My professional opinion is that you have managed to piss off the wrong bunch of farm boys this time.
Really
Leaving you in charge of operations until he recovers.
Just perfect.
Parker.
What is that?
That.
Its early in the game yet Mr. Rains. Jesse James and I are just learning how each other moves feeling out each others patterns.
First of all you shut up.  Now youve given me a thousand miles of railroad to cover. Every time the James Gang strikes we shift a hundred detectives to that area. But theres just too much open land too many riverbeds to ride caves to hide in. This gang operates across four states often riding a hundred miles between jobs.
Ummm . . yeah. Luis is calling me tonight. I need to be home for that.
Yes?
You like it there dont you?
Courtney youre going to have the peanut butter soup with smoked duck and mashed squash. New York magazine called it a playful but mysterious little dish. Youll love it. And then...the red snapper with violets and pine nuts. I think thatll follow nicely.
Pull out goddamnit
Oh Jesus. Im going home.
Oh Christ this really isnt worth it. And see Courtney its there for what? Huh? Tell us.  Why is it pulled down half an inch? So it can catch the force of the ejaculate
What are you doing tonight?
Thats nice.
Do you want to come to my apartment or not?
Marzipan. Pink tents. Hundreds thousands of roses. Photographers. Annie Leibovitz. Well get Annie Leibovitz. And well hire someone to videotape. Patrick we should do it.
Get married. Have a wedding.
Your father practically owns the company. You can do anything you like silly.
Why? Whats wrong?
But what about the past? Our past?
Girls dig Bateman. Hes CQ. Youre total CQ Bateman.
Listen what about dinner?
Jesus Davis. Yes. That was hilarious. That was you wasnt it?
It was a pretty long message wasnt it?
By the way Davis how is Cynthia? Youre still seeing her right?
Excuse me. I really must he going.
It never was supposed to he Why isnt it possible?
Patrick? Is that you?
This is Gwendolyn Ichiban. This is my very good friend Patrick Bateman. Where are you going? Were going to Nells. Gwendolyns fathers buying it.  Where did you get your overnight bag?
Call me please Patrick.
What...is...it?
Van Patten looks puffy. Has he stopped working out?
I cant believe that Price prefers McDermotts card to mine.
Yes Carons right. Gorbachevs not downstairs. Hes at Tunnel.
Im leaving. Im getting out.
And Bateman what are YOU SO fucking zany about?
Late?
And...Spencer wants to meet you for a drink at Fluties Pier 17.
Ill do it.
You dont like this I take it?
What is it?
Who?
Yes Patrick?
Jean?
Oh Patrick I cant make this decision.
Yes? Youre dressed...okay.
Well maybe we shouldnt go out to dinner. I dont want to ruin your willpower.
Interesting.
Jean? What?
Patrick Batemans office.
Patrick? Is that you?
Just...say...no
A model? An actor?
Oh really? DAISY He said...  He said you gave him bad vibes.
You think Im dumb dont you?
Did you know that guy who disappeared? Didnt he work at Pierce  Pierce too? Was he a friend of yours?
So whats the topic of discussion?
Ah I see...Yes. Pauls disappearance...Yes.
Coffee?
KIMBALL.
Oh no Im okay.
Where did you go to school?
Nice. Very nice.
Pardon me but are you okay?
Would you rather I not smoke?
Yeah...Yale thing.
So...theres nothing you can tell me about Paul Owen?
What kind of man was he? Besides...  the information youve just given.
Do you feel that way?
Where did Paul hang out?
He had a yacht?
Dont you know this?
I mean no ones dealing with the homicide squad yet or anything right?
The earth just opens up and swallows people. 
Uh no. Theres one...down here.
Listen if anything occurs to you any information at all...
Listen Im a little spent for now but how about lunch in a week or so when Ive sorted out all this information?
No I like music. JusttheyreHueys too... black sounding. For me.
According to his date book and this was verified by his secretary he had dinner with...Marcus Halberstam.
Ive questioned him.
He does? Youre sure?
Listen whats your name?
And hows Cecilia? Shes a great girl.
Hey Halberstam?
I just dont see how someone anyone can appear that way and yet be involved in such total shit. How can you be so fucking I dont know cool about it?
You are a fanatic.
Alice? You gotta make him do the startup with Teddy and me.
Im just screwed.
Its important.
When I was a kid? And he was moving us all over the place? I spent all my time writing stuff on Outpost 1.0. I thought Gary Boyd was the greatest.
If my dadd leveled with me like that even once... The weird thing is my fantasy he could somehow be like the old Gary? Its his fantasy too.
Cmon I wouldnt have a destiny without you. My destiny would be dying at 20. From eating 
What
I cant see Outpost putting its reputation in the hands of people like that.
Go where? You cant get away from people like this.
Its the only one with dishes on the roof. The studios a front. Thats why they keep postponing its opening.  ...gotta get in there.
I know how to get in there. But youve gotta help me.
That was  different.
Milo?
This is the biggest Beta demo in like the history of software. Youd be my partner.
What?
What?
Is it your software?
Thats gotta kill him right?
Milo. Surprised hes not your guest.
We could move em up here.
The content filer has tbe written into the media files so bits coming off the satellite can be read by multiplatforms. Really omniplatforms. Including whatever new hardware emerges.
You really wrote this just today?
Everything I do is under scrutiny. The questions they ask trying to make anything strategic look sordid.  Im confused. Doesnt everybody in business try to get ahead?
Youve been coming in early.
You couldve handwritten it.
Gary I 
This is good. Who did it?
Hasnt affected his work though.
Help me change the Skywire settings. Add five degrees to each satellite coordinate.
Ready for number three?
I know you lost all his work. Maybe I could come down here and 
...You wanna work  here?
Could it be a glitch? Something the construction workers caused?
Every entry was authorized.
Delbert seems to enter 21 twice. Without leaving the first time.
Get the backslash the colon keys kids dont use but geeks do.  What would Milo want in here anyway?
Come with me.
Now what are we doing? I dont get any of this shit
Im getting a teachers pet rep.
Me too Were you an Army brat or something?
Whatve you got there?
So when you were talking about wishing people were more like computers. Was that then? Or now?
Thats great. I  didnt know.
...Milo?
Yeah they dig stuff like this.  CBS News has partnered with Outpost Information Systems in a cable news network due to launch Fall of 2001.
Its how online services push logos they wanna sell you. You dont ask for em they just appear. Have to work on it somewhere besides my office or my house. And then the quality of the broadcast wouldnt exactly be digital thats 12 months away.
Gary knows Im close on Skywire. We have to do this fast.
Oh man. Id have to get into Garys house. To get the satellite positions.
I dont know 
Hardly anybody does thats the beauty part. No cameras the DOJ doesnt bother with it its accessed by a tunnel they boast about. You know the best place to hide a leaf?
Oh.
Same with the excerpts Im choosing theyll play against any of the images you described.
Please dont go.
Maybe its the satellite.
...You got my Email?
Is that how Larry feels?
But these like White Supremacists trashed my office last week.
A beautiful geek? I dont wanna sound paranoid or like a pig but whatre the chances?
That kids the great white hope.
How do you feel Mr. Cunningham?
Pardon me for being rude It was not me it was my food.  It just popped up to say hello and now its gone back down below.
Milk milk lemonade.  Round the corner fudge is made.  Stick your finger in the hole And out comes a tootsie roll
Im going to paint this can of soup and become famous and not give you any credit for it.
Just where youd never think to look for him. Well be there.
Thank you.
Yes?
Russian Intelligence? Are you mad?
Carnies.

Im leaving  Oh and Austin?
Hey Austin Powers its me Mick Jagger.

Good afternoon Mr. Powers Im the Destructacon 5000. Im programmed to prevent you from progressing beyond this point. You might as well surrender. Resistance is futile. Your odds of survival are 23763273 to...
Mr. Powers my job is to acclimate you to the Nineties. You know a lots changed since 1967.
My mothers told me all about you.
Pretty groovy Jumbo Jet eh? How does a hot chick like you end up working at the Ministry of Defense?
You know a Chigro... part Chinese part Negro...  Chigro.
Brrrr She must be frigid. Theres two things I know about life one Americans will never take to soccer. Two Swedish girls and stewardesses love to shag  Theyre shagmad man Let me ask you a question Vanessa and be honest.
Hey who put this in here? Someones playing a prank on me  Honestly this isnt mine.

Its a shame he wasnt more headstrong.
Its not what it looks like Vanessa.  At ease boys.
OK Austin Danger Powers One blue crushedvelvet suit. One frilly lace cravat. One gold medallion with peace symbol. One pair of Italian shoes. One pair of tiedyed socks purple. One vinyl recording album Tom Jones Live at Las Vegas. One Swedishmade penis enlarger pump.
One warranty card for Swedishmade penis enlarger pump filled out by Austin Powers.
Everything seems to be in order.
Oh my God hes back.
Shut up.
Remember when we froze your semen you said that if it looked like you werent coming back to try and make you a son so that a part of you would live forever?
Breathtaking Frau. These automated strumpets are the perfect bait for the degenerate Powers.
Release the sharks  All the sharks have had laser beams attached to their heads. I figure every creature deserves a warm meal.
Right.
Fine. Whatever. Mutated illtempered sea bass it is.  Come lets return to dinner. Close the tank.
No well leave them alone and not actually witness them dying and well just assume it all went to plan.
Come everyone let us repair to the main chamber. Project Vulcan is about to begin. Scott are you coming?
We also own the Franklin mint which makes decorative handpainted theme plates for collectors.  Some plates like the Gone With The Wind series have gone up in value as much as twohundred and forty percent but as with any investment there is some risk involved.
You didnt...
Were not yet open for business Im afraid.
Normally wed be eager to oblige 
As real as you wish. Hot or cold. Humid or dry. Anything you like. Within reason.
I want you to say the first thing that comes into your head when I say these words. Do you understand ... ?  Blue ...
Knight ...
Nature ...
Hope...
Ah beautiful. Just as he promised.
Mrs. Peel ... Come quickly. Brollys been betrayed Ill tell you everything ... The weathers getting worse and worse ... theyre after me ... coming for me ... come quickly
May I help you madam ...
Your voice  its so familiar ...
Congratulations Mrs. Peel. You have been a worthy opponent. You have tracked us down. You are within an ace of winning.
Close. Were so hushhush even we know nothing about it.  Now lets see theres coconut cake date and walnut I recommend the rum baba ...
My number two. Special assignments. Shes 
Who?
For starters. Of course I had to kill the Teddy Bears as well ...
Doctor Peel I presume?
Red herring would have been too obvious dont you think?
Much better.
... Showers followed by sunny periods.
That place is so absurd so out of date ...
According to Mother Sir August owns half of the Highlands. A millionaire. Former head of Special Projects at the Ministry. Now ...
Not so much eccentric. More barking mad. He has a wife called June. And a daughter somewhere  Julie.
So ... I distract him while you snoop around? How?
Thats possible. Sir August was convinced hed met me before. But Id never met him. Another odd thing. When it rained he said it was just as someone had promised.
Elementary Mrs. Peel. Trubshaw isnt the only shoemaker still practicing his trade ...
Not quite. This is my field.
The Prospero Project was started by my husband. It was an early attempt to solve the problems of global warming. In theory climate engineering is entirely feasible. We thought of injecting a chemical cocktail into the atmosphere by laser and satellite. A quick fix...
Exactly. Thered been earlier attempts to pump carbon dioxide into deep sea. Propane gas mostly. In small quantities it captures chlorine. Protects the ozone layer. But it proved impractical. Too bulky ...
Thats what we were working on.
Three agents killed by bad weather...
Steed ... 
Was I?
And do you trust me?
Youre playing games.
Im playing to win.
Please dont tell me its how you play the game.
Teddy bears cuckoo clocks toys All childrens things ...
The owl and the pussycat went to sea 
Your mission is simple. Find out how and why these agents died.
Wheres Mother?
Emma in Wonderland. Welcome Mrs. Peel.  Weve been expecting you. We hope youll enjoy your stay with us. Decontamination is almost complete.
Talk to the pipe Mrs. Peel. That usually helps. Dont worry about me being invisible. Other than that Im perfectly normal.
Ah here we are. Steed asked me to play a hunch  Valentine Peel.
Privately owned by ...
Youre not venturing alone surely.
Still doesnt. Better safe than sorry.  She was in a dangerous game Steed. High stakes. She may prove to be a risk.  If she is theres only one solution.  Termination.
I was hoping you could tell me.
Cocky little bastard. I hope he was a baddy.
John Steed.
I think she really likes you ... Wheres Mrs. Peel?
Look at that guy. What a hunk.
I dont get it but at least Garys got the real stuff coming up here in a few minutes.
And...
Whats Debbies blue book value right now?
I dont want any trouble.
Im ready to make you another deal.
Great car.
Low mileage... Handles like a dream.
Yes son did you find out where the bachelor party is?
I know youre as unhappy as I am about Debbies marriage to Rick.

Stop fooling around... I need to talk.
That feels so great.
Well... twentyfour more hours to go and tonight well share with our friends and loved ones the joys of those last moments of singleness.
Wouldnt think of it. Because tomorrow...  Were going to the chapel and were...
This is it lady. Last stop.
Okay I promise... I swear on my mothers grave.
Have a good time. Dont make it too late.
I dont believe you.
See? And these are not just ordinary partygoers  there are professionals in this crowd  I didnt want any of them. You... Youre what I want. Understand?
Of course you do. I trusted my ex Mel too. Cousin I can only talk from experience. What do you think they do at these parties have tea and play scrabble?
Are you sure this is a good idea?
Great bathing suit.
Jumbo where the hell are the women?
Screw you... Screw that... Dont jerk me around. You promised me 1500 seats for the Police Concert... 1500 not fifteen... Screw that... Screw you  Screw Sting.  Hi guys.
Wait a minute. You been living with Debbie Why do you want to get married?
Sounds swell... Im really touched. And my getting marrieds not gonna change a thing between me and my pals. Were still gonna go bowling on Tuesdays play cards on Fridays and wear womens clothes on Sunday night. I love you guys... I always will.
Give the guy air. Everyone to a neutral corner.
Its true.
Looks like the only one who got screwed here was you.
What can I be doing for you?
Not one minute longer or Milt will come for you.
You want to share it?
She hates me. Its over. Youll see as soon as you get married everything changes. You sure you want to go through with it man?
Youre trying to kill yourself with an electric razor?
Youre all under arrest. Open up
Id love that.
Whered she go?
Well spend an hour with Nymphos Without Pants...
Im not really hungry.
What the hell is that?
Whats this?
Youre late again Rick.
How the hell are we supposed to get this donkey inside?
Oh these moments do try me...
Thats Franny. She likes firemen.
 What the hells the matter with you? You always check the other side. I havent got time for bullshit right now okay? We got a job here.
I like what youve done with the place.
In the Field Museum once.
People actually used to pay you for this?
What is it with you man huh? How do you manage to keep coming up with new and amazing ways to screw up? That scotch bullshit? Am I really supposed to believe you came crawling back home because you suddenly felt heart strings moan for the family biz? You were bankrupt man.
Thanks.
Jesus its too damn bright in here... Like a goddamn spotlight... Im goin blind...
Thats not what its about Brian. The point is there was a kid in there. And what if thered been two? I went in because thats what I do. Its my way. Its dads way. It isnt everybodys way.
When dad died I saw another fire...
I hate him so much sometimes Stephen. You dont know how hard it was for me to put that uniform on...
 Stephen wait a minute. I gotta talk to you. Its Adcox hes 
Dont tell them about Adcox... Dont let em...
Boy took you all of thirty seconds to blow that.
No hes more of a dinosaur. Guys not a dummy though. Hes juggling alot of balls on this one.
Well our specimen here is your basic standard issue piece of primary suppression equipment. This area is the pumping panel which controls the rate of liquid insertion into the hose.
Brian. Whats wrong?
Will you please keep your voice down theres people 
Oh yeah hes the real fireman.  Who are you? Just another probie working for Swayzak 
I think your boss is going to need some spin control.
Brian McCaffrey...  Oh this is really a treat. Brian McCaffrey. Lost a dad to the animal huh?
Okay heres the deal. Ill tell you a story you tell me one. Fair?
Famous story even. Straight burn. Just an engine and truck first on scene. What did you feel Brian when you first got there?
If it was a joke sir youd be laughing.
 Shhh.
Temperature in this room was about 2000 degrees but copper wire in outlet is melted which requires 5000 degrees. An accidental short in the plug could of created a spark of 7000 degrees hot enough to melt the wire and start a fire.
Read.
But he could have killed everybody there. The firebreaks kept it from spreading in the wall. The backdraft blew out the flame. Thats it. Thats the reason.
This is the copy of Swayzaks manning report that was released. Everybody on this job knows its bullshit but we could never argue with the numbers. Theyre all airtight.
Did you pull me out?
Did I say thanks?
Four months?
Thats Sean? Jeez hes a giant.
Completely out of control.
And just this year Brians Sound Spectrum. Your own company even. Big step.
Whos going to die?
Your brothers right. If you dont fasten these correctly they could open and youd get burned.
Firehouse.
Dad
We gotta roll Stevie...
Uh Helen I wanted to talk to you a second about Sean...
You cant talk about my brother like that...
Stephen what are you doing here?
Oh yeah? Hows he doing?
Ah Stephen thats what this is really about isnt it? You always have to be right.
Yeah? When was the last time?
Im sorry... I... couldnt sleep...
Anyway down here take a look...
See that patch of shirt? We wondered about the discoloration so he ran a spectro. On a lucky shot we picked up some traces of Trychticholorate. Nobody around here had ever heard of it.
Probably got in Cosgroves clothes in a gas state from the fire.
Whos this?
I cant get over what those guys did to her. I just cant.
Susies not a virgin anymore.
The Church is a fucking racket. I know how they operate. Ive been part of the racket since the first time some faggot priest spilt water on my head. My Aunt Lu says I was crying all the way through. Yeah I know their game inside out. Now Im free of it and Im gonna stay that way.
People.
Can you believe the nerve of this fucking guy? He kills people for fun and then he puts up 100 G to bring in some guys who raped a nun. What a sick fuck. Man...
You brought it back to the Church. And then it made its way back to me again.
I forgive you.
OK asshole. You owe thirty grand. Now what are you gonna do?
Fuck Strawberry. Youre gonna end up owing 60 G to a homicidal maniac
You do know that hes gonna blow up your house kill your wife and kids 
Hows the case going?
The fucking rapists man. The punks who raped that nun. The 50000 reward from the Church Remember?
BLAK OUT.  BLAK LISTED.  BLAK BALL. Need I say more.
Cmon.  Its easy.  Its the same thing yall do out at the Yankee game no different cept we changing one word.  Everybody go it?
You idiot.  You almost gave me a massive coronary.
Im not huggin you in the middle of the street.  You must be crazy Julius.
Im not callin you Big Black Africa. Mommy and Daddy named you Julius.
You dont have the demographics.
Were ready when you are.
Life is beginning to look up.  Its all good in da neighborhood.
Its that bad huh?  Its all over my face.
Please have a seat.
Why they gotta make my nose so big?
So thats what you been doing?
Sloan and I have been looking all over for you.
Gentlemen the show our show will be satirical.  You know what that is dont you?  Trust me on this one.
Hurry up I wanna watch HBO.
We ran out without my shoes and the floor.  I gotta get my stuff.  What about our savings?
If its not too much trouble could you order us some food?
Youre now Mantan.
Im always gonna be that.  But I aint doing no more buck dancing.
No matter how sexist or racist the material may be?
...exactly thirtytwo minutes ago.
Four minutes ago.
The middle class black family moves into a white suburban enclave.  The middle class black family moves into a small Southern town that is run by the KKK.  The middle class single black father raises his teenage daughter.  The middle class single black father raises his teenage daughter.  The middle class single black mother raises her teenage son.  And so on and so forth.  Its too clean too antiseptic...
What is it you want from me?  Some plantation follies?  Some sitcom that takes place on a watermelon patch?  Some show that follows four nigger generations of junkies and crackheads?  You want me to go back to the ante bellum days?
Ive done a lot of soul searching and once again you are right.  In my previous work its been all surface superficial.  I have never really dug deep.  Not anymore.  As Mark Twain fully understood satire is the way.  Race has always been a hot button in this countrys history and it needs to be pushed harder.  If we are ever to live side by side in peace and harmony. Its about promoting racial healing.
Dont worry about that thats my department.  Now who do we cast? We need a star.  Can Whoopi sing or dance?
Ignorant dullwitted lazy and unlucky.
Mantan is an uneducated Negro who always by some stroke of unbelievable stupidity makes his best laid plans go haywire.
We gonna hit em wid da BOMB DICKEY on dis one.  Whats the setting?
ThatswhatImtalkinbout. ThatswhatImtalkinbout  Hes off the hizhook
Thats exactly my point.  Has he even directed actors before in anything?
I dont give a good goddamn about Finland Norway Sweden or wherever ya blond ass came from.
Hold on a sec I got a call.
Thats what Im askin.
Dem white boys giving you a hard time?
The truth is never let them seeya sweat.  You do that thats half the battle.
Three nights Charleston South Carolina.
So he drank himself into a stuper?
So whats up with you?
Sounds risky to me.
You okay?
Same here.
Whos side are you on?
Is that good or bad?
How so?
Whyd you do that?
Dunwitty and I feel youve been getting too close to him getting his mind all messed up.
DeLa you should try it sometime. Come into the light.
That was a mistake but I dont regret it.
Hi Mona.
Im happy for all of us.  Its just we have a great responsibility now. The pressure is on.
Thats the way it came out.  Let me ask you one question.  Have you ever been in want in need your entire privileged life?
You feel good not nervous?
You must think Im some kind of fool.
You hear me talkin to you.  The only time you come up here when something is wrong.
Hows the food?
It was.  It is.  But this is a different kind of show.
Regardless he still is your father.
Yes I know.  Jukka have you ever seen a Negro person before?  Even had a real conversation with a real Negro before?
A fiasco.  A disaster.  A boondoggle. An abomination.
Myrna is here to help us plan our strategy.
Yes you
You sing and dance?
Why do you say that?  Youve never seen me.
Before we begin I want to thank you for coming on my show for your first television interview.  You could have chosen Mike Wallace Barbara Walters Jane Pauley whatnot but youre here.
Money and nothing else?
Dont you feel that is a simplistic retort?
No mo city slickers.  Ahh cant you smell the sweet aroma of the ripe watermelons and high cotton?
Cousins I want all of you to go to your windows.  Go to your windows and yell.  Yell Im tired of the drugs the crack babies born out of wedlock to crackhead aids infested parents.  Im tired of the inflated welfare rolls while good wholesome Americans bring less and less of their paycheck home every two weeks. Im tired youre tired were all tired of these socalled bible thumping God fearing whore mongling Professional athletes.  Arent you tired of these basketballdunking footballrunning hophip rapping ebonicspeaking sex offenders who got ten kids from ten different Hos?  I know I am and so is Sleep N Eat.
Yknow my lady Lucindy?
Too bad.  How bout a dress?
Mantan way too short too tight. Get her one of dose...
...that was Vicki her best friend. Dat dress will cast ya round...
I heard ya lady is wild.
Around...
...then what about...
...like macaroni and cheese...
I slept too near where I fell out.
Dats yo Uncle Ben.  That reminds me Ive seen a lot of troubles lately.
Sleep N Eat I was my wifes husband and grandchild at one and the same time.  And lo and behold as the husband of a persons grandmother is his grandfather I Mantan became my own grandfather.
I feel a song a comin on.
What else?
Oh you do huh?
Yknow at the beginnin of the century AfricanAmerican had to perform in blackface.  You ever heard of Bert Williams?  He was a great artist.
Why all of a sudden are you flippin on me?  This blackface thing was part of the deal from the gitgo. Dont even try to play it like you aint a part of all this.  You down with Delacroix.
Ill be down front.  You better start putting your face on.
What?
And?
Dont try to change to the subject.
Is your mother not afraid on account of the highwayman to let one so young as you travel?
Pooh  Pooh  Best you are joking.
Wheres the beauty you promised me?
Good morning Private James.  Please come in.  I should like you to meet my uncle Herr Minister of Police Galgenstein.
The captain was the nephew and heir of the Minister of Police Herr Galgenstein a relationship which no doubt aided in the younger gentlemens promotion.
You are a Hungarian you served in the army and left on account of weakness in the loins.  He gambles a great deal and wins.  Do you know the cards well?
This is a pretty way to recommend yourself to the family.
And now you risk the same fate.  If you are killed your mother is all alone in the world.
Grogan gave me a wink of recognition but offered no public token of acquaintance and it was not until two days afterwards that he called me into his quarters and then shaking hands with me cordially gave me news which I wanted of my family.
Mr. OHiggins I cannot say how grateful I am for your timely assistance to my wife.
Whom have I been harboring in my house?  Who are you sirrah?
Chevalier though I cannot say how I believe you have cheated me.
Where is my rascal Lazlo?
Good gracious  What is this?
It is shameful  infamous  I insist upon being put down at the Austrian ambassadors house.
Ten thousand?  But the scoundrel owes me seventy thousand.
I have no luggage.
You are the young man who M. de Seebach recommended?
For whom else have you worked?
And I think he was as much affected as I was at thus finding one of his kindred for he too was an exile from home and a friendly voice a look brought the old country back to his memory again and the old days of his boyhood.
But if they send you away then what is to become of me?
Gentlemen I wish you a good day. Will you please go to the house from whence we set out this morning and tell my man there to send my baggage on to Three Kings at Dresden?
I risk nothing for I am certain to kill him.
Never.
To make me wretched in two weeks.
I feel the ribbon.
I hate Miss Clancy you know I do And I only danced with her because  because  the person with whom I intended to dance chose to be engaged the whole night.
What with me on the pillion?  Would you kill poor me?
Monster  Your father was a tailor and you are always thinking of the shop.  But Ill have my revenge I will  Roddy will you see me insulted?
And to be sure I did know someone who knew precisely how these things were done and this was the distinguished solicitor and former Government Minister Lord West whose acquaintance I made as I had so many others at the gaming table.
Have you done Mr. Cosgrove?
Then this must be done tomorrow.
How different was her lively rattle to the vulgar wenches at Kilwangan assemblies.  In every sentence she mentioned a lord or a person of quality.  To the ladys question about my birth and parentage I replied that I was a young gentleman of large fortune that I was going to Dublin for my studies and that my mother allowed me five hundred per annum.
May I be quite frank with you?
Mister Bracegirdle said to me that he had heard her ladyship lives in some fear of her life and meditated a separation in which case she might later repudiate any documents signed by herself while in durance and subject them at any rate to a doubtful and expensive litigation. They were quite insistent on this point and said they must have absolute assurance of her ladyships perfect freewill in the transaction before they would advance a shilling of their capital.
But I will have it on my birthday wont I?
One of the boys in the stable told Nelly that youve already bought my horse and that its at Doolans farm where Mick the groom is breaking it in.  Is that true papa?
Yes hes fine.
In truth sir yes but if you must marry then marry a virtuous drudge.
Well if my intentions are what you think they are  if I do wish to step into your shoes what then?  I have no other intentions than you had yourself.  Lady Cosgroves wealth may be great but am I not of a generous nature enough to use it worthily?  Her rank is lofty but not so lofty as my ambition.  I will be sworn to muster just as much regard for my Lady Cosgrove as you ever showed her and if I win her and wear her when you are dead and gone corbleu knight do you think that it will be the fear of your ghost will deter me?
Yes.  He brought me in his carriage and he will call for me at midnight.
He will believe that it will please me if he asks about it and I shall tell him everything except some circumstances which might humiliate him.
Can I at least have a drink?
Hurricane kept you up too?
Fuck what the fuck is going on 
Holy fuck... Holy fuck what the fuck did you guys do?
Some.
Well why didnt you say so? Well just drop all your charges then 
You shot Childs and Nunez.
I guess Nunez wasnt dead after all. He came after us with a vengeance.  You know the rest.
I promised them Id ask you where West and the others are...
Back up.
Wheres the cabin?
Cadet whats your name
He wouldnt kill anybody...
Shut up.  Let me see your grenades.
Roberto what the fuck?
Right?
Mueller.
You hated West Mueller loved him 
That still doesnt mean you didnt kill him.
Full clip to the body 
I... I dont know...
My father is a powerful man. Over the years hes used that power to protect me in one form or another from certain... unpleasantries.  I am a homosexual.
Levi I dont know if youre familiar with investigative work but we have this little thing called motive and you just gave yourself one.
He admitted it.
Why did he come back for you?
Epileptic attacks are murder on your system. Rattle your internal organs like a paint mixer.
Dunbar was running out the door? Ohhhhhh... See thats where I was confused because I thought you said Nunez was running out the door.
Dunbar will testify that you were.
No the problem is ones dead ones got a bullet in his arm and one wont talk. The one who wont talk was trading live fire with the dead one as we reached the pickup.
Hes not done by a longshot I can get more out of him 
Weve already been over the terrain twice. Nothing.
Without the body we have no physical proof. We need a confession.
Theyre taking your command arent they?
Youre a good soldier Bill.
What I cant understand is why you signed these. If youd just let West take care of the paperwork no one would have known but you got careless. So when Pike finally told the truth you had to get rid of him too.
No You will stand there and you will listen What happened to you Bill? You were the one who joined up to do good in the world. You were the one who believed in it 
Ah Christ
Is Dunbar cute?
You guys really got the shit kicked out of you here.
Remember hes the son of a Senator so go easy. Kid gloves.
Too neat. How long have you been an investigator?
Styles couldnt reassign him hes a legend 
Goddammit Hardy you cant just leave 
West was a monster Fifteen years ago I was here I was Section Eight I was Pike. Fuck being the knife dummy  that thing he did stripping Pike down making him stand outside all night? He did that every year he did that to me. Fifteen years ago I wanted him dead and now Im supposed to care that somebody offed him? Sorry no can do. I tried.
I was starting to believe you you know? That you werent who everyone said. I guess I was wrong 
Why do you care?
I didnt shoot West...
What?
Thats a fantastic idea 
I pushed him too hard.
For what?
We were close to something with Kendall.
Hardy what are you doing 
We need to talk 
This isnt the time 
Do I have a choice in this?
What are you doing out here?
Your phone number?
They found him. Poor fucker was practically blown in half 
We just want 
He said what?
Nunez was chasing Dunbar.
You and Dunbar got your stories straight. Little details little inconsistencies designed to bounce us back from one of you to the other asking questions killing time until the transport arrives and whisks you away to where Senator Daddy can protect you. You think youre just going to slide out of this? Youre an accessory to murder Levi youre going to jail 
I told him what had really happened to West. Told him to keep quiet about it or Id destroy him. Because if it came out that I was involved with the whole PX scam my father would be finished.
Tell him to shut up 
Sign here and here.  Hey aint you the folks workin on that whole hulabaloo from last night?
So?
But this guy you called hes not even Army 
You want Kendall dont you?
Great great. Thats fantastic.
See The big guy likes it.
Jesus kid.  Let me guess. Real pretty blonde hair blue hat?
You wont find a better place
Well she... uh...
How are you gonna make it without your shoes?
No one would come out here unless they had business. And no one would have business with me except for you. Youre buying the town.
Lord Im sorry I...
Ill...
He was buttering her rolls. Pumping her churn. Splashing milk in her box.
I thought you said you didnt have a church wedding.
Youre just trying to get me to leave arent you? Thats why they sent you here.
You dont like it?
Okay.
What did she say?
Having a kid changes everything. I mean theres the diapers and the burping and the midnight feedings...
No but I hear its terrible. Then you spend years trying to corrupt and mislead this child fill its head with nonsense and still it turns out perfectly fine.
People neednt worry so much. Its not my time yet. This isnt how I go.
And every day I gave him a quarter. Every day. Then I got sick and was out for a couple of weeks. And when I went back there you know what he said?
Your mother hasnt been keeping up the pool. If you wanted to you could...
Why not religion Dad?
Josephine actually went to the Congo last year.
Dad
The thing about icebergs is you only see 10 percent of them. The other 90 percent is below the water where you cant see it. And thats what it is with you Dad. Im only seeing this little bit that sticks above the water.
Dad Im about to have a kid of my own here. It would kill me if he went through his whole life never understanding me.
The river.
Tell me how it happens.
Lets get out of here.
I dont believe it
This is it? The whole vault.
Are you Jenny Hill?
I spent a week in Morocco for the story. It was incredible.
I talked with your father last night.
You never told me how your parents met.
What about the details? How they fell in love. The Circus. The War. You never told me any of that.
Ruth McHibbon offered to pick you up at the airport.
Is that Dr. Bennetts car?
I dont know if youve seen it but Josephine has some photos in the most recent Newsweek.
How is that possible? I mean you try to ask him a question and suddenly its another one of his stories.  You cant honestly say you know him.
Before I forget your father has papers in the basement Id like you to go through. I wouldnt know whats important.
Mom?
Mom do you want some time with Dad?
You know what I mean babe Its enough. We can stop.
Do you like it?
Hows that? We cant drink our piss can we?
Yes. I know.
And...
Right.
What was that?
You must have a visa or something...
She says she has a secret to tell.
When?
What was that?
Tell me.
Do you believe in love?
I have brought you trouble. Maybe I should have come alone.
He says you scare him so much he must go to the toilet in his trousers. John he is a soldier. A trained killer. We must do what he says.
He wants a lot of money.
Do uh... Sorry. Can you follow me? Do you understand what Im saying?
Uh... Are you a giraffe?
They go.
Oh I dont know. In my job as Deputy Assistant of New Business at the bank would have to listen to the problems of a great many individuals. This took a lot of understanding and sympathy to try to work out solutions to their problems. But you see Im not in that line of work anymore. Nowadays Im a bank robber.
Give me some money.
So uh Alexei which I know isnt his name...
Fine.
Not the kids type then is he? Not that broody. You must be pretty miffed.
Shut up. Im not listening.
No.
Well pretend it never happened.
I dont hate you.
Sometimes which?
I think its my safest bet dont you?
You know in Russia theres no work for women. Its a different world.
What? I... I wasnt saying...
I wasnt saying anything.
Fifteen. You dont know him. He was very kind and strong.
The rest of the world John its not all like St. Albans.
Have you had any before?
Ive got an hour. Can I buy you a coffee?
You can probably buy them on the flight.
Whatever.
Why?
My names Sophia.
What are you doing?

Stop it Stop it IT HURTS
No maam. You stop that foolishness.

Now thats sharp. Thats real sharp. Miss Ella Mae set you up didnt she? You like it?
I dont want you to let go.

Was that Lincoln James I seen run off?
Got no place for preachin here. Not now. So you do as I say...
A naked woman chained in ya house?
And now these three remain faith hope and love. But the greatest of these is love.  Who gives this girl in marriage?
Keep the change on that.
What happened in there... that wont your fault. Aint a young man alive could keep they britches on with that girl being in heat like she is.
You a preacher?
But thats so fuckin stupid.  Im sorry. Didnt mean to curse.
I dont see why we gotta lie bout it when you and I know this aint gonna work.
I think if I just piss... Ill be okay.
What?
I feel better. Do you?
Alright. How much you need ho?
Whats this?
Nick lets go hunting.  Bag Cavello.
What are they doing now?
What are you missing?  Riding your motorcycle to the nurses house. That shit is sadder than Ethiopia.
Whatd you say?
Nick have I been a good partner?
Givin you a book is like givin a baby a gun.
What does Ichiro mean anyway?
Where do we start looking for this guy?
Wherere you going Ichiro?
Its Ichiro.  Ich.
You know Inspector you take shit once you take shit forever.
It may be too soon to talk about it. When someone we care for dies we...  ... keep something of theirs.  A tie a pen.
You must leave?
Ive continued working on the case
Know her?
You said you could keep up with her No problem Nicksan.
Nick...
Work lunch groceries laundry... Fabulous...
Ich my name is Nick.  Not Nicklaus not Nicklaussan not Nicksan. Nick.
I want to go talk to him.
Its very small.
Nick you cant do this.
Just one compadre... Kampai.
Dont be an ass.
You know where I can get a decent cup of coffee this time of night? Im buying.
I dont remember saying yes.
Might be different in New York.
Sugai wont give it to me you know that.
I want a gun.
Hey inspector I dont intend to take the rap for this.
You had my help detective.
Im sure glad you found us Sebastian.  What do you think Mary?
The name is Batty.  Roy Batty.
And what can he do for you?
Because by the second day of incubation any cells that have undergone reversion mutation give rise to revertant colonies  like rats leaving a sinking ship.  The ship sinks.
But not to last.
Not only that but we have smiliar problems.  Accelerated decrepitude. But we dont want to die quite yet.
You could help us.
He could?
Id be happy to mention it to him.
Then were stupid and well die.
Six huh?
You got a machine on it yet?
Look go home.  Get some rest. Take an aspirin.
Its gotta be right for my customer.
Well when do you get paid?
Machines can be helpful sometimes but they can also be a pain in the ass.  Ask for a trace on a forger and you might wind up at a steel mill.  I dont mind a bumsteer once in a while  its their personalities that usually get me.  Somebody once said that man makes machines in his own image.  If thats true whoever made Esper should have been shot.
You start.
How do I stop one?
Not if it works.
Next.
But I would like to buy you drink.
Vodka
Prosit.
How long you had these guys?
Hey its okay.  I like to pee. So how are you doing?
Lets hear it.
I didnt say that.  Your motivity rate checked out a little slower than last time.
During the road test...
Your mind kept wandering.  That bothered me.
But you havent put in for emigration.
Id like  you to take a look at these pictures.
Nothing.  She wanted to know about suck night.
Yeah?
Are you for real?
Its a good job.
The best.
It seems your department doesnt believe out new unit is to the public benefit.
I wouldnt accept it.  Also Id report the person who gave it to me to the police.
In a magazine you come across a fullpage photo of a nude girl.
Who is this?
I dont know... I think I missed something.
Uhhuh.
Why do you call it retire why dont you call it murder?
Dont you think anything that can suffer deserves to be considered?
You know what I think?
Where the hell you been?
Bad?
May I ask a personal question?
Like you said Mr. Deckard a machine can be a hazard.  The VoightKampff scale is a machine isnt it?
How many questions does it usually take Mr. Deckard?
I kinda get nervous when I take tests.
Maybe youre fed up maybe you want to be by yourself  who knows.  So you look down and see a tortoise.  Its crawling towards you...
Im hungry J.F.
Methuselah Syndrome.
Eve I dont mean to be rude and please excuse me Cliff but Eve isnt Cliff just a butt with hair?
Get out of here
Say...did you just lose your job because of me?
Whats wrong with you?
Right.
Yes Yes The Holiday Inn Thats exactly right
I dont have to take a physical in your space ship?
Wait  Wait

That was...wonderful  Ive never felt anything like that in my life.
Wait Eve please  Wait.
I think its the eyes.
Watching television in color.
Whats fair?
Why not buy them milk or something instead of Dr. Pepper?
Who are these people?
Thank you.
Adam?  Dont even think about it. Okay? Im sorry.  I know that sounds mean but believe me it would be meaner if I didnt say it. Okay?
Then forget it.
Because I want to get married.
It does?
I didnt know that.
It didnt used to be that way.
Get out
He has a computer?
The guy with the underpants
Yep.  You know my father  who is a scientist  says that everything is a miracle. Everything. Until recently I wasn t sure what he meant by that.

...and his church group have volunteered to help us bring the supplies down.  But weve got to hurry.
No.

Whats wrong?
Millions upon millions upon millions The cards. The stock  The clothes The toothpaste  The guy was on the level  And you blew it  A man walks into your life who is the kindest most polite honest trustworthy incredibly rich guy you have ever met in your life And what do you do?
Im going to need two more banana splits and a cherry coke
I dont want to talk about it. Everythings okay now. I dont want to talk about it.
Shit Ben How the shit are ya?
To your health Frank.
Frank I have something for you. Excuse us everyone.
Detective Williams here. Yeah. Tell him to go to Sergeant Milton. Yeah copy.  Well Jeffrey you found something which is very interesting to us. Very interesting. I know you must be curious to know more.  But. Im afraid Im going to have to ask you not only not to tell anyone about your find but also not to ask more about the case. One day when its all sewed up Ill let you know all the details. Right now though I cant.
Jeffrey?
Why do you do it?
What color is it?
And that man came out with a third man  this welldressed guy. Heres the photo. I think a girl named Dorothy Vallens is in trouble with these people. I think Frank has taken her husband and her son.
Well now Jeffrey how did you come to get so involved?
Yes its me Frank is on his way up to Dorothys apartment.  Oh no. Frank has a radio and is hearing everything we say  Detective Williams. Hurry. Im in the apartment. Hurry. Im hiding in the back bedroom.
Because of your information I alerted internal affairs to check out Detective Gordon. I had to keep on with him as if nothing was different. He slipped off on his own when he found out we were going to raid Franks place.
Oh God that stuff stinks.
NO you come on. Take off your pants. I want to see you.
What do you want from me?
Do you like the way I feel?
Yes.
It used to make me laugh but.
Yes. Frank
Im not crazy.  I know the difference between right and wrong.
What do you want to do?
That wouldnt be too good would it?
Look snap out of it will ya?
Do you love me?
Dorothy. No
Yes.
They hurt his head.
Frank gone?
Yeah maybe so. Franks got me and you and really its all thanks to Don isnt it. Remember that. Your husband was the one who started fucking my mind with drugs.
Were looking for him. In your opinion why did Frank kidnap Dorothys son and husband?
Hey? You like to walk.
Jeffrey breakfast is ready.
Thanks a lot Mom.
No Im just gonna walk around.
God you scared me.
Hello uh my name is Jeffrey Beaumont. Is Detective Williams in?
I just wanted to ask him a few questions thats all. Maybe I better go.
I was sorry to hear about your father. I know your mother from church. Its such a shame.
Its a real good chocolate cake. Duncan Hines devils food. Real good.
He comes over to study.
Please excuse me a moment Jeffrey and Ill get to the dishes.
Well.
Hey you ivy league shit. COME HERE
Oh yeah?
Thats the building. She lives on the Seventh Floor. Dont stop to look long the police are watching.
Did they find out anything when they questioned her?
You said it was a strange world. And youre the strangest part of it. Are you crazy? She is possibly involved in murder. This gives me the creeps.
It wouldnt hurt to hear the plan I guess.
Now well walk over so theres no license plates and you give me at least three minutes. I can stall if its more but I need time to find a good window alright?
Are you alright?
Yes. I do.
You want a Dairy Queen?
Wow. Should you tell my father?
You saw a lot in one night.
No silly  Im still in school you know. But Ill meet you after school and you can tell me what youve learned. You better be careful Jeffrey.
Okay be careful.
Oh yeah?
I cant believe what you are finding out. Are you going to continue with this. Are you going back to her apartment?
You worry about me really?
Everything okay?
Okay.
What was that all about?
Take her to my house. My dad can get an ambulance faster than anyone. Do you have anything to put around her?
Jeffrey? Whats going on?
Sandy?
Please get to your father and send him and the police to Dorothys apartment right away. Be sure your father comes. Something is happening over there. Theyre hurting someone the guy she loves. Tell them to hurry. Im going over right now.

Who did you kill?
So what do you think?
There he goes.  Okay gentlemen. Are we ready to bring this man into the light? Are we ready to truly do the work of the Lord?
Now you will receive us.
It is your evil who will be sought by us.
I knew you two pricks would give me problems. Give me shit cause Im a woman. Im not gonna take your male dominance bullshit
And its the same story over here. Why the crossover?  Theories.
So Duffy got any theories to go with that... tie.
Jesus. I just cant think anymore. That scene over at the coffee shop today tapped me out.
These two fucking scenes are related. Too many coincidences. Same day? Five hours apart? Dead mobsters on both scenes. Now why did he kill the bartender?
Who the...
While Greenlys getting coffee anybody else want anything?
What are you serious?
Hello?
Vincenzo that fat motherfucker Yakavettas right hand. Hes the one who set me up. Then he went around shooting his mouth off telling everyone I was as good as dead. He goes in there every Wednesday night around 1000 he jerks off in the same booth to the same titty dancer. Never misses.
You bet your ass he will.
Hey We gotta talk about this early morning church shit.
Well keep going Roc.
Has he now?
You gonna do what I say got it?
Dont do this my son.
Im Rocco. Im the funny man. Heee Hee. Im so fuckin funny. Hee Hee.
Tell me a joke funny man. Hee Hee.
What color hair does he have?
Making Hutch David Soul?
What does Starsky say?
Did you see what I meant about the window?
Now. One thing we need to discuss is timing. Timing is absolutely crucial. What are you doing? Anthony
Dignan calm down.
Is that the manager?
What about what that guy said?
You owe me fifty bucks.
Dignan I cant get my hair cut. Thats just not possible all right?
This is Inez. Carmen. Anita.
What the fuck is going on here?
Shes from Cuba.
He needs to hire an attorney.
See now weve got a plan.
See one day we were playing hot box over at my next door neighbor Mr. Langstons house and Anthony fell in the pool and got knocked unconscious. I had to dive in and save him.
Mr. Langston performed cardiopulmonary recitation. CPR. Ive never said this before but frankly I thought Anthony was dead. The veins in his face were all sticking out. His skin was blue. He truly did look dead.
Hes gone. He stole the car.
That coward. Son of a bitch.
He went back for his brother.
So when you were saying Bobs at the store and acting real surprised that was just an act. You were just 
Man. Im sorry. We just went for a walk 
I have an idea for that.
Inez has a master key to all these rooms doesnt she?  Doesnt she?
She doesnt need to know.
Our money situation is not good.
Sixteen dollars.
He doesnt want to fight.
No fighting. It wasnt Bobs fault.
I dont want to be too much of a liability.
He was a nice guy.
Ive got a great view up here. I can see all the 
Whats happening? Whats going on?
Wheres Kumar?
Come on.
Dignan its too late.
How big is it?
Where?
So how is it in there? 
This is my business manager Rowboat.
Thats a sharp jacket.
Look at that woman. Shes what? Fifty? Fiftyfive? But she hasnt let herself go. I appreciate an older woman who has a commitment to her body.
Ill tell you Anthony. Times like this I get philosophical. What does it mean? Whats it all about? Are you afraid to die?
But youre thieves. Its what you are.
See you.
You think he got my license plates?
Anthony I 
You dont have to talk about it if you dont want to.
At first they were going to charge me with manslaughter. Thats partly why I was in custody so long. Sixty days.
Yeah. One minute youre studying Great Expectations and the next minute youre drawing the Holy Mary for some kid who tried to stab his girlfriend.
Was Future Man adopted?
No I know. Im just saying. I feel fine. You want a piece of cake?
Let me see it.  Did you drop it?
Yeah.
Its in the driveway.
We might have to take that chance. Cause I feel pretty strongly about this.
You dont celebrate til its over.
Dignan and Anthony this is Little Richard. Hes crazy. Totally nuts.
Im not allowed to drive those.
How much could you grow? Realistically.
If its that easy why doesnt everybody grow them?
Dont you guys tell anybody about my plants.
The guy is fucking insane.
I know that now. Hes a fucking psycho.
I paid for it.
How much is there?
You really think hell remember you?
I mean Jesus Christ Bob. You didnt have some vicious lunatic screaming Im going to remember you
Way to go Bob
Im sure he did. Well have to get new plates.
Bob. Are you coming?
I dont think they can make it stick Bob. I mean what do they actually have on Future Man?
That could be anybodys.
So tell them the truth. What do you use it for?
What do you mean get back?
Dignan. Youre going to give me those keys or youre going to get hurt.
Youve got a beautiful walk Bob.
It wasnt your fault Bob. You had your brother.
Come on Bob.
I know Bob. You were on a secret mission.
Dignan. Good to see you. Good to see you Applejack.  Who are you?
Whats the story?
Ill say. You killed his goddam girlfriend instead. Now theyre onto Neski. Theyre at the Brecker Hotel even as we speak.
No. The files are spotless. Whatever they find its just going to make Conklin look worse.
Treadstone.
Lets talk about Conklin.
...Ivan Mevedev  senior financial manager  worked for one of the new Russian petroleum companies Pecos Oil. He claimed to know where the money landed. We believe this could have only happened with help from someone inside the Agency... This...
Sorry to wake you.
Sir...
I would want to know.  I would want to know that my mother didnt kill my father. I would want to know that she didnt kill herself.
Thats not what happened to your parents.
It doesnt matter. Your life is hard enough.
You know Im not.
Front. Use your teeth.
You still shouldve moved.
Try again.
Youre sure?  We should still  we should write it down.
 it hasnt been two years 
We write them down because sooner or later youre going to remember something good.
Its just a nightmare.
No... How?
But we were so careful.
Where 
Switch You drive
Im going to bail on the other side and wait. This bridge is the only way he can follow.
If he crosses the bridge it is.
I love you too.
You hear me? I believed you.
Why is she trying to kill me?
A Russian?
So when was I here?
Thats a lie
We need to get in there.
 so there were two of these explosive charges placed on the power lines. One of them failed. The fingerprint...  Thats from the one that didnt go off.
Theres only a Consulate they sent a field officer out half an hour ago 
 go  take the van 
Maybe he just needed a place to spend the night?
Alright... take it down.
 who?  who else is here? 
Im here. So is Donnie and Jack Weller. We understand youre using the full allocation for this buy?
Still...
Okay cut to the chase Pam. What are you selling?
Amnesia?
Are you an expert in amnesia?
Believed what?
You felt nothing? No spark? Two young people in Paris? Dangerous missions? Life and death?
Some women like Dobermans 
I dont think we need to keep looking for him anyway.
Black coat possibly leather. Dark slacks. Dark tshirt.  He says theyre gonna try and corral the guests on the street over there and then check them out but...
Were looking at all Berlin outbound. Good news is every train station in Berlin has thirty to forty fixed digital security cameras. Common feed.
What it means in England  and in Scotland too  is that rebels have forfeited their lands. We were ambushed last night. But the Scots dragged their dead away.
Did the priest say anything about the Resurrection? Or was it all about Judgment?
Sir William. We come to seek a meeting.
An oath to a liar is no oath at all. An oath to a patriot is a vow indeed. Every man of us is ready to swear loyalty to you.
I will meet you but only one way  if Robert the Bruce is there and puts his hand on my Bible and swears his loyalty to Scotland.
Longshanks promised
Scottish rebels have routed Lord Bottoms
While I am in France fighting to expand your future kingdom I learn that Stirling castle is lost our entire northern army wiped out And you have done nothing?
Now my flower do you understand?
I am cheerful with a plan to soothe your miseries. All of England shudders with the news of renewed rebellion.
The Bruce is not coming William.
Thanks for the food and drink. And for bringing em yourselves.
Keep these. Were going too.
Wanna stay with me tonight?
Excellent Stephen is my name. Im the most wanted man on the Emerald Isle. Except Im not on the Emerald Isle of course mores the pity.
We must run in different directions
 while many who serve him have taken and broken his oath many times. I cannot commit treason if I have never been his subject
When the king returns he will bury them in those new clothes. Scotland is in chaos. Your husband is secretly sending an army north.
Last night I slept with a member of the War Council.
This Scottish rebel... Wallace? He fights to avenge a woman?
I come as the kings servant and with his authority.
Let us talk plainly. You invade England. But you cannot complete the conquest so far from your shelter and supply. The King proposes that you withdraw your attack. In return he grants you title estates and this chest with a thousand pounds of gold which I am to pay to you personally.
Drink this It will dull your pain.
No. But from top to bottom this country has no sense of itself. Its nobles share allegiance with England and its clans war with each other. If you make enemies on both sides of the border youll end up dead.
I thought I was dead when ya pulled that dagger
Plenty. Who knows? Maybe hes got severe coping problems about not having a father. Did you say the last blackout occurred when he was with his friends dad.
Its worth a shot. I can arrange a controlled meeting. A careful dose of sedatives for Jason some security you and I monitoring. Evan comes in for a quick visit and with any luck no more missing father complex.
All the dads are gonna be there.
I dont like this place Mom. Its creepy. Please can we go? I promise I wont make any more bad pictures
Thesell bring you luck Crockett.
I dont know... I dont remember.
I... I blacked out.
Did Da  Jason  get good grades?
Why do you ask?
And then just before it got so bad that he had to be committed he said that he could...
I dont know. These things take time.
I found these. The others are still in storage.
Best not bitch up. Wind up someones luggage that way.
Youre religious Carlos you believe that bit about the Lord works in mysterious ways?
Because I think he sent me to your cell on purpose. For you to help me.
Are you hurting her?
You remind me of your father. He always screamed for a photo album even though he never had one.
Get out. Both of you.
I cant believe Tommys still pissed at me. He knows Im moving away right?
I dont understand where are you taking me?
I cant put my finger on it but everythings a bit off. Even the dinner tonight. It was beautiful but...
Oh Im sorry. Does my line of work make you uncomfortable precious?
Whats happened to you?
Because youre... different.
Im the only person youve told? Thats a great line. Does that make other girls swoon? Do they actually eat up this bullshit?
Anyone with fifty bucks could tell you that.
I just thought you should know.
Kayleigh? Do you ever think about us? I mean wonder if it could ever have been different between the two of us?
I dont get it.
Lets just say youre being closely watched George. Your other option is to get your porn off the rack and treat Kayleigh like... oh lets say like how a loving father treats his daughter. Sound okay to you Papa?
Thats dangerous You could blow your hands off
You cant play God son. It must end with me. Just by being here you may be killing your mother.
Thanks. Wow. Hey I want to do something really special for Kayleigh tomorrow. If I said I needed some help from you and the brothers...
Just dont drop the ball okay?
Most guys tuck their porn under here but all you have are... comp books.
Freeze No wormboy. No Mr. Worm and no WormMasterGeneral Once you get a nickname like that you cant shake it. And I dont want everyone thinking Ive got tapeworms coming out of my ass or something okay?
Can... can... Can I have this?
I couldnt cut the rope.
Uh we should be getting to class now.
Hey whatd you do that for?
What the hell are you doing?
No one thinks youre a piece of shit Tommy.
Lung cancer?
Mom. Dont cry. I can change this.
Just get out didja?
What did I say about mentioning that bitch?
Shut up Tommy
Maybe it went out. Should someone check it?
No I mean is he trustworthy? Is his word 
Does he know that?
Nobody ever loved me that much.
You want my advice?
You will find a market there for this ring. I am forced to sell it at a great sacrifice.
Goodnight.
But Sacha always puts out that light 
Id better be going.
You havent heard my offer.
I see the bus is in. Ill take my shipment with me.
Rick Ill put my cards on the table. I think you know where those letters are.
Shall we draw up the papers or is our handshake good enough?
Dont forget you owe Ricks a hundred cartons of American cigarettes.
Weve decided Signor Ferrari. For the present well go on looking for two exit visas. Thank you very much.
Rick?
It was gracious of you to share it with me. Good day Mademoiselle Monsieur.
It is possible the French authorities will find a reason to put him in the concentration camp here.
 It was La Belle Aurore.
Theres still nobody in the world who can play As Time Goes By like Sam.
Ten years ago? Lets see...  ...Yes. I was having a brace put on my teeth. Where were you?
I wouldnt have come if I had known that you were here. Believe me Rick its true. I didnt know.
I didnt count the days.
Did you run out on me because you couldnt take it? Because you knew what it would be like hiding from the police running away all the time?
All the same someday youll lie to Laszlo. Youll be there.
I went through all that with your husband. Its no deal.
Do I have to hear again what a great man your husband is? What an important cause hes fighting for?
Put them on the table.
But Richard no I I 
Where is Rick?
This time they really mean to stop me.
We are only interested in two visas Signor.
Yes I see. When I had trouble getting out of Lille why didnt you leave me there? And when I was sick in Marseilles and held you up for two weeks and you were in danger every minute of the time why didnt you leave me then?
Yes?
Ask me?
Ilsa I 
No Victor there isnt.
Good evening.
There must be some reason why you wont let me have them.
I beg your pardon?
Dont you sometimes wonder if its worth all this? I mean what youre fighting for?
But we made a deal.
No Captain please.
My bill.
And the honor of having served the Third Reich.
I am making out the report now. We havent quite decided whether he committed suicide or died trying to escape.
This is hardly the time or the place.
Very well Herr Laszlo we will not mince words. You are an escaped prisoner of the Reich. So far you have been fortunate enough in eluding us. You have reached Casablanca. It is my duty to see that you stay in Casablanca.
For the time being.
I strongly suspect that Ugarte left the letters of transit with Mr. Blaine. I would suggest you search the cafe immediately and thoroughly.
Captain Renault are you entirely certain which side youre on?
We are concerned about more than Casablanca. We know that every French province in Africa is honeycombed with traitors waiting for their chance waiting perhaps for a leader.
You see what I mean? If Laszlos presence in a cafe can inspire this unfortunate demonstration what more will his presence in Casablanca bring on? I advise that this place be shut up at once.
I was misinformed.
It is my duty to see that he doesnt impress the other half. Rick Laszlo must never reach America. He stays in Casablanca.
Oh no Rick never 
Well Ricky. Im very pleased with you. Now youre beginning to live like a Frenchman.
Serves me right for asking a direct question. The subject is closed.
Why do you interfere with my little romances?
How can you close me up? On what grounds?
And Im taking a friend with me. One youll appreciate.
I thought I asked you to tie up your watchdogs.
I have the letters right here.
Call off your watchdogs you said.
If you dont mind you fill in the names. That will make it even more official.
Well Rick youre not only a sentimentalist but youve become a patriot.
And that ten thousand francs should pay our expenses.
Uh huh.
Will I see you tonight?
Rick Im sick and tired of having you 
Come on were going to get your coat.
Are my eyes really brown?
May I? Too bad about those two German couriers wasnt it?
But why? Oh you object to the kind of business I do huh? But think of all those poor refugees who must rot in this place if I didnt help them. Thats not so bad. Through ways of my own I provide them with exit visas.
But think of all the poor devils who cannot meet Renaults price. I get it for them for half. Is that so parasitic?
Well Rick after tonight Ill be through with the whole business and I am leaving finally this Casablanca.
Sam Ferrari wants you to work for him at the Blue Parrot.
Hell double what I pay you.
No. Not me boss.
Well stop it. You know what I want to hear.
This sort of takes the sting out of being occupied doesnt it Mr. Richard?
Its bad.
No more water you said.
Get water
You fucking bleeding heart you kill or you die.
Look just slip off the raft.  The ocean would feel so good the waters so soft and warm.  Take a little swim.  Sleep.
Use the sail for a sea anchor and you wont move.
You know Wilson every now and then we should say thank you.  Thank you God.
Its real.
Well I have to say Im impressed.  You never gave up.
Want to come in?  Get dry for a minute.
No.  that was the last one.
Your eyes are puffy.  Did you take Valium again?
Got to follow the paper path here.
Hey look at you.
I have to go.  Im on call for overflow down at the Hub.
Thats your dog.
Chuck youre breaking my heart.
Whens the next Jumbo?
Sorry...sorry... Why do my joints still ache?
Need some help?
Youre Chuck Noland.
Bless us O Lord and these thy gifts which we are about to receive from thou bounty through Christ the Lord.  Amen.
Really?
It seemed like she had such a good time last time.
Doing great Mom dont worry about me.
Whend you start working here?
Talk is cheap.  Are we on or not?
Youre fucking dead
When I first showed up I thought youd lost your fucking marbles.
Youve been over the line and you came back.  Youve been saved hallelujah
As it happens Im headed for Frisco myself.
He sniffs that ether Ive seen him do it
Whatd she die of?
What are you going to tell the little ones?
Its time somebody ate them.
Its gettin late. I think Ill pack it in.
How many months are you?
Oh...
Im a little worried about the...  ...about how much bleeding is okay.
A movie outside?
Youve seen only one movie? Which one?
But you looked as if you liked it.
Whats the medical explanation?
The screen is enormous Imagine King Kong up there Have you seen a lot of movies here?
Arent you worried that people will cut their feet?
Just tell me. Do you want me to go? Do you want me to stay?
Olive told me.  You might have told me yourself.
I know.  Is that nothing.
Stop it Just cut it out
I helped you not to think about Wally. You were so upsetyou couldnt stand worrying about him about his being killed and not coming back but when you were with me you could stop worrying... well for a while anyway. This is how I helped you right?
And now that Wallys coming back and because hell certainly need you...
Ive got some more clothes for you I just keep forgetting to bring them with me.
You can trust me. Is it Jack? Its not Jack is it? Its Muddy Is it Muddy?
So many children. Are they all orphans?
I was just showing Homer the orchards... kind of a geography lesson.
He thinks people like to get whacked by branches.
Homer Wells born Portland Maine March 2 1915...
Is your father dead?
Dont get too excited Fuzzy.
Did you bite it?
It looks like you bit ititll be all right.
No you did it yourself. Maybe in your sleep.
What kind of plane are you flying?
I wonder if you might give me a ride.
Where are you going?
No Im not. I need a job.
Uh... Im shipping out sooner than I thought. I just wanted to be sure you were settled inand happy enough considering...  Are you bored stiff? Or can you stick it out for a bit?
Im stayin Homer.
First pregnancy?
If you take enough of it your intestines lose their ability to absorb Vitamin C.
I thought you took care of this. It always breaks in the same place. Its your splice isnt it?
Doubtless youll let me know what immensely worthwhile or at least useful thing it is that you find to do.
In other parts of the world I suppose there are other ways.
I dont need thisI know all about my condition.
I am not a doctor.
Thanks guys... Id like to go with you. But Ive got to move on.
Rose Rose?
Shit. We dont know what he is.
That just aint right Jackyour cigarettes gonna end up in nine or ten gallons of this batch of cider That aint right.
Its not that hard to find it in there Jackitll take you just a minute. You just gotta go fishin.
Then its malaria?
What view?
I told him that you all is sick.
Yeah you really showed him Daddy you just about cut your own hand off and all you cut off him was his clothes
You aint goin nowhere in the middle of the night girl
My names Grant. Grant Ashby.
Heres where a little research comes in handy. Corporate banks give out VP titles like calendars. Its a small lie but now were sure hes playing.
Thats right. And tech firms... They tend to scare people off.
Banks need to know how theyre going to get their money back.
Then there it is. Ashby gets the itch.
Hey Jake... When am I gonna get to play the Inside?
So howd you get caught?
Hes just as crooked as the next guy. Youd think hed have more important things to do with tax payer dollars.
What are you? New? Let me tell you how good this guy is. Last night Al calls this bookie to settle up. Apparently hes been ducking him for like a month. So the guy asks him where hes got all this money all of a sudden right? What does Al do? Does he tell him that he cashed in a fucking Bar Mitzvah bond? Does he tell him hes been giving head out back for twenty bucks a pop? No... He starts going on about this job he just pulled and how he fleeced some Wall Street assholetype... How HE fleeced.
Poor bastard never knew what hit him. Jesus I almost felt sorry for the guy.
You know what were doing with the money.
We only owe the King a hundred and fifty.
She got one leg out from under him. Now we had to lean.
Were going to make it back Grant. Three or four times over.
Youll be there?
Then he had to bang it out across the street at the Bank of the Caymens...
Grifter huh? Where have you been on the grift? Couldnt been here long cause I would have heard of you Skippy.
Minus one.
I guess it lacks a certain style.
That tip not workout for you fellas?
I dont know what youre into with the King Pin but whatever it is we get a piece understand? We get a big piece. If we find out youre keeping us out I may suddenly develop a conscious and give you up to Moonan myself. Say something stupid if we got a deal Jake.
Sorry I 
I lost my head. Im... Sorry. I dont know what happened.
Thats not 
Sorry about your wallet but if you think Im going to suck dick over thirty seven dollars a maxed out Visa and a bad fake I.D. youre fucking crazy.  Jake.
Says who?
Alright Hold up. You win. You got the job.
We had to see what your deal was. Im just a little superstitious.
Mr. King I think 
You need to get a haircut.
Were going to rope this banker tomorrow and you gotta at least look classy if not be classy. You gotta do this thing and I dont even know if you can.
I dont trust anyone.
Uh... Everything okay?
I think youd do it for free. Youre almost drooling. You like the rush.
Im your basic underachiever. Cant stand working and porn doesnt seem like a good option.
He was looking out for you.
No. You trusted him... You were just getting square.
Everyones working an angle right?
What about...
Stop waving that thing around.
Its bad luck.
Meet me at my place later.
What youre looking for in a mark is someone whos weakness you can exploit.
What do we do? We change the scam?
Feeling lucky today Miles. Found a penny  Heads up. There was an empty cab right outside my building. We hit every green light.
King aint gonna like this.
Exactly. Cept this Gillette guy. He gets to walk around in three piece suits hob knob with the Mayor own a bank that kinda shit. Meanwhile the King sits holed up in the steam afraid to even take a leak without me or Harlin watching the door.
So thats it huh? You get the cops to give you a safe ride.
Hes wheeling around two million dollars in cash and he wants to stop to use the bathroom. You believe this?
What happened?
Hey I been on the ramp all my life so I got no problem with the way you help yourself Jake.
So what do you want?
Coupla things. They got this Fed looking around and the girl just split.
Like we told you before we think hes into something with the King Pin 
You help me catch him. Whatever hes into next I want you to be into. And what youre into Im into. If it all goes well those two guys from IAD will never have to hear this tape. Ill clear you guys of anything youve ever done with Vig under the guise of some cross departmental investigation. This pricks been on the wish list for so long youll probably get gold shields out of it.
You sell it.
I hate cheats.
What kind of deal you looking to?
Is that your idea of arithmetic?
I get it.
No no. Im not ready for you. Theres some vodka in the freezer.
You really are a beautiful woman.
Are you trying to read my palm?
I loved it blond.
When you get home Im asleep. When I leave home youre asleep.
This fucking jobs getting to you. You havent written a fucking word since you started.
Well thats my poor upbringing. I didnt go to no private school. I havent got no class. I want to live with a writer. Not a fucking croupier. I dont even know what the word means. Croupier.
I dont give a fuck about the sex. Most menll fuck a lamppost. Hes just a miserable zombie. Is that the way you feel now? Is that whats happened to you?
Without hope theres no point to anything.
What?
Nothing about you.
Yes I know that.
Im not married. I wear it to keep the flies off.  I must go. Let me pay for this.
Toss you for it.
Jani theres something I want to say. Before we get there. I dont know what the sleeping arrangements are. Giles probably expects us to share a room.
Which side do you like?
Im in trouble.
I owe a lot of money.
My creditors. One night around three in the morning theyll come into the casino 
Just listen. You dont have to do anything criminal.
You dont have to be criminal. A man will come up to your table and deliberately cheat. Youll see him stop him and the guy will make a big scene. Therell be chaos. And thats when itll happen.
I want you to forget what I said.
Would you like a drink?
Hello...
Jani Where are you?
Ross.
Nice car. How much did you pay for it?
Where do you live Jack?
So how do you feel your first night? Ill bet youre on a high.
Coming up to two years now.  But I was away for six months.
Ill lay you five to one you wont sleep. In this job you have to unwind. Otherwise itll kill you. I mean that.
That Greek guy who won at the end. You paid him out in 25s not 20s.
Does Bella come here?
What happened to Bella?
You dont recognise me? You had me barred. You fucking little worm.
Youve been recommended by the management here. They know your father. He has a bit of a reputation hasnt he?
Why four? And not three or five?
Stacks of 20. Rows of 5.
How many aces are left?
I make it six.
You want me to check?
Next point. Friendships between croupiers inside or outside the casino are discouraged. Relationships with females working here are expressly forbidden.
This isnt South Africa. Wed know because someone would report it. Believe me someone always does.
Wed know. There are no secrets in this casino. Youd be punished.
Thanks for the information.
Ninety seven million minus eight corrected to mass critical.
Im getting this flickering light on one of my panels.
The key
It didnt go off.
Pinback I have a computer reading of nine five seven seven.
Well... now what? What do you have for us now. Boiler?
Find me something I dont care where it is.
Remember what we found? Fourteen light years for a fucking mindless vegetable that looked like a limp balloon and went squawk and let a fart when you touched it. Remember?
One hundred twenty seconds to drop bomb have you checked your platinum euridium energy shielding?
You wont consider another course of action for instance just waiting around awhile so we can disarm you?
Bomb this is Doolittle. You are not to detonate repeat you are not to detonate in the bomb bay. Disarm yourself. This is an order.
Well of course I exist.
Exactly.
Well then youve already admitted that you have no real proof of the existence of the outside universe.
So you have no absolute proof that Sergeant Pinback ordered you to detonate.
Thats all beside the point. The concepts are valid wherever they originate.
So if you detonate in...
Pinback...
Your GHF reading is minus fifteen.
Yes.
Another unknown. Not on the charts. A red dwarf.
What are you gonna name it?
The new star. What are you gonna name it?
Hey Doolittle think well ever find real intelligent life out there?
TALBY
Must get lonely being up here so much.
Phoenix Asteroids? Never heard of em.

Yes sir. Negative effect.
Sorry sir you faded out there for a minute.
Commander? Are you still there?
But see tonight wives and girlfriends arent invited.
Mr. Sonrisa saw you on the cameras.  He wants you to come see him.
Look that thing about the pliers I was just doing what the man pays me to do. Ya know?  Comin off hard.
This is what your lifes worth Bruno.
Some of us are trying to sleep.
Move it.
But Im afraid of
Whatre you lookin at me for?  Im not his next of kin.  Anyway I dont got that kind of cash lyin around.
Which means I gotta fence it for two. Whos got that kinda scrilla lying around these being the worst of the times.
Whats with you?  Every week this scumbag puts the squeeze on us and every week you roll out the welcome wagon like hes family.
Damn... Are you alright?
What else can we do?
Look we gotta keep the momentum up here not give her a chance to think.  If she hears her kids voice...
Goodnight Bears.  Goodnight chairs. Goodnight kittens.  Goodnight mittens. Goodnight clocks.  And goodnight socks. Goodnight little house.  And goodnight
Because we cant.  Theres nothing here for us anymore.
Dont worry Im coming to get you.
So what you liked it because it was shiny?
Am I sposed to be flattered by all the attention?
So now you tracked me down.  What dya think?
So what are you gonna do about it?
I havent been able to get you off my mind.
We got separated right away.  I never knew how many made it.
Yeah I catch your hacks.  Hes Satans lap dog or something.
See youre back and still rocking the boat.
It turned up on the black market.  One of my sources thought I might be interested.
But she does work here?
And so should you.  Sketchy told me I could expect a visit from you.  I know all about how you threatened him.  That if he didnt break it off with me youd save him the trouble.
Well its over between you and him. Were getting married next month.
Big part of loving someones being able to forgive them.
Help... Lemme go... No dont let me go... Help...
Say the words I understand.
What about the other kids?  You get anything on them?
At least he didnt swing with your ride.
Only one I can think of.
I say hang the bastard out to dry let her see him for the heel he is then maybe shell step to the allgirl team and let mamalicious ease her pain.
Yeah I can see to it your winning streak continues.
Right after you change your wardrobe your personality and drop about thirty pounds.
So how do you get the woman to come to me?
Make the call.
Playing hooky again?
Dont believe everything you hear on TV.
You left out condescending.
Here it comes.  The part where the guy turns everything around.
Fight fire with fire.  Threaten to go to her husband.
But you explain that youre a compassionate and understanding person who can find it in your heart to forgive me.
Max what did I do to deserve a friend like you?
You rock Max.  You... Rock...
No Im serious.  That psycho got exactly what she deserved... Yes.
She was the one
True but
That was extreme  Did you see that one guy
This is a hot run.  Beat it.  Youre late.
And Theo cant pick up his own check because?...
For a change.
You tell Theo hes not in tomorrow he can start looking for another job.
Hot run to 842 Beulah corner of Haight... And you can tell your pal Theo he just got his worthless ass fired. Not that he cares but the wife and kid might.
Thanks miss.

Whoa... she is a killer.

What was that D.J.s name again?
Whoa... she just farted.
But... but St. Bernards is way the hell over in the next county
Now how are we gonna do this?
We got you a change of duds when we picked up the car.
Jeezis Hawk can you at least keep it within twenty miles of the speed limit?
Do you realize the sheer goddamn unadulterated undiluted no holds barred one hundred percent pure as Ivory Snow absolutely friggin STUPIDITY of what you just did?
Dude this is all I got.
Dont you think we should at least pull over and offer to clean it off?
Oh Im sorry Trip. What you made was a big brainless pile of horse shit. No offense.
Jeremiah what are you doing?
But mom
Someday youll have a son just like you Jeremiah. A boy who lies through his teeth buys demonic records and smokes the dope just like you.
Well? Continue Continue
Tell you what. You keep guessing and Ill say something when you get it.
Poor Jam man. Imagine having to stash your KISS records inside Carly Simon album covers. No question Mrs. Bruce is a psychobitch from hell.
I knew it I knew this was gonna happen I had a bad feeling since last night. Remember? We are so totally fucked
Oh everythings hunkydory now that the shit hit the fan just like you said it would you snug sonofabitch You fuckin jinxed us

Yeeeehaaawww This is totally fuckin curly man Thank you God
So... according to Hawking... wormholes might be able to provide a short cut for jumping between two distant regions of spacetime.
A wormhole with an EinsteinRosen bridge which is theoretically... a wormhole in space controlled by man.
When can I squeeze one out?
What happens if you tell Mom and Dad about this Samantha?
Why did you make me flood the school?
Who is... we?
Where did you come from?
Why are you wearing that stupid man suit?
What happened to your eye?
Why do they call you Frank?
My dad said he found you on the golf course. Are you sleepwalking again?
Wanna walk me home?
Wow. Did he go to jail?
The best thing about soap is that its the only thing on earth that can never get dirty. No matter what crap you throw on it... it always rubs off. And there it is again... perfect.
So when you sleepwalk can you remember afterward? Like do you dream?
Do you ever feel as though theres always someone watching you?
What happened to your neck?
Babies cry because theyre afraid of the dark. And because they have no memories... for all they know... every night could be the last forever. Like perpetual darkness.
Thats alright... I understand.
They suspended me for two days.
Yeah. So the idea is that... you buy these glasses for your infant and they wear them at night when they sleep.
What? How long was I asleep?
My mom is gone.
I dont know. She didnt leave a note. The house is all messed up.
Im so scared... I just keep thinking that something awful has happened. Its my fucking stepdad. I know it.
What?
Is that a cellar door?
Im sorry Ms. Farmer I just dont get this.
People arent that simple.
I have to take the girls to Los Angeles tomorrow.
If Im lucky.  So... I wont be back until the first. Your dad will be back on Sunday so Ive put Elizabeth in charge until then. She has the car... so she can drive you to your therapy tomorrow.
No... apparently they cant tell us what happened yet. Something about a matching serial number that got burned.  But I had to sign a form saying I wouldnt talk to anyone about it.
Frank... instructed you... to get out of bed... just before this happened.
What else do you think about during school?
What about your family Donnie?
Who is they? Is Frank part of some larger group?
Yeah... you know...  Fucking.
So your parents... why did you disappoint them?
Regret.
I have to obey him... because he saved my life. He controls me and I have to obey him or Ill be left all alone... and Ill never figure out what all of this means...
Where are we going Donald?
No I dont.  She worries about you.
Its not that. I mean mouthing off to your teachers. Ill admit... when Dad told me what you said to Ms. Farmer I laughed my ass off.
Gerald.
Has your son ever told you about Frank?
If thats what you think is necessary.
Our son just called me a bitch.
I havent been accepted yet mother.
No. I took a year off to be with you.  Of course I care. Dont get angry.  What?
I didnt realise it was such a big deal.
How did this happen?
Rose... I have to appear at his arraignment tomorrow morning. And as you know the girls also leave for Los Angeles tomorrow morning. Now as their coach... I was the obvious choice to chaperone them on the trip.
And how do they do this? They FLOOD the house... by breaking through the water main
Wicked.

Oh I almost forgot...  I got my acceptance to Tokyo University.
Now were on the right track... Put back dear... How does it read?
You havent been still a moment since youve been here.  You act as if you had neurosis 
Hey you

I dont wanna stick out my tongue.
Look Im a very nervous man.  I gotta have a job where I come to work at eleven  go to lunch at twelve  and quit at one.  And twice a year I gotta have a six month vacation.
You know Id be lost without a telephone.  Now  where were we? Oh yes  I just made you Secretary of War.  The first thing you do is buy ammunition  you buy it from me and I get 10 commission.
Wait a minute.  What kind of an army do you think we oughtta have?
You no gotta no gun.
Thats not fair  weve only got fifty thousand.

Are you sure youre not tired?
Thats what you think.
Then its war?
What I called you...  Why what did I call you?

Gloria  may I call you Gloria?
I  I may be wrong but I suspect the Secretary of War.
I said  I suspect the Secretary of War.
Oh.  Then there his somebody else?
Gentlemen  Gentlemen
I shall report this indignity the my President.  Mrs. Teasdale  I feel this regrettable occurrence will plunge our countries into war.
Uncle you cant do this
Oh... why Mr. Merrick shes beautiful.
Yes and they send their kisses. Would you like your sherry now?
Frederick why are you so interested in this particular case?
Hes doing it to spite me I tell you and its got to stop
He was fine when he left here and now look at him.
Now I think we really do understand one another.
A hospital is no place for secrecy Mr. Treves. Doctors spiriting hooded figures about are liable to cause comment. Why wasnt this patient properly admitted and why is he in isolation? Is he contagious?
...As I said its only a physical problem... but I do feel that Mr. Merrick is very flattered that youre taking the time and trouble to meet him and hes most anxious to make a good impression so he might seem rather nervous.
Excellent. We shall present them along with the other particulars of the case to the committee. I want them to see exactly how horribly his body has been affected. You and I shall vouch for his inner qualities.
...I... everyone has been very kind to me.
What is it Treves?
I say Freddie what are you about?
Good Lord Freddie What have you got in there?
You never mentioned his mental state.
What say you fair one? That the tongues of men are full of deceits?
Good day...
Alas no.
Well it is a miracle he ever got back. And Im sure Mr. Treves under your expert care hell have many happy years ahead.
Is he... dying then?
Feeling better now Mr. Merrick?
Good morning Mr. Merrick.
What? Oh I see Its St. Phillips. Oh of course. Why... why thats very good I mean youve gotten the windows and arches just right.
The... oh the spire How silly of me its as plain as day... Mr. Merrick where did you learn to do this?
Yyess.
Yes
Yes.
My... name is...
Merrick...
Why my dear Mrs. Mothershead how good of you to join us. Mr. Merrick will you please introduce yourself?
Righteousness for his namesake.
Good evening. How are you feeling?
How long will I stay here?
Ohhh...
The children May I see?
Would you... would you like to see my mother?
Good morning John.
...my... home?
Yes John?
The workhouse.
Good morning Mr. Treves. Itll be his bathtime soon. Has he eaten?
Very smart indeed.
Well...
YOU BASTARD You tortured him. YOU TORTURED HIM you bastard. WHERE is HE?
Just one of the curious. Id like to see it.
Pardon me?
Its your fantasy...
Its sinking HyBrasil is sinking
Those things in your hands.
Have you ever felt like this about anyone else?
The Cloak Invisible. It was my mothers parting gift.
No
But you dont realize....
I dont want to live WITHOUT you.
Have you ever seen the sun Erik?
Really.
Ill tell you what...
Its all part of our safety regulations. You see if someone were to get hurt they might get angry and then... well...
Because thats how he makes his money by war and plunder
Is there something the matter with it?
Ill kill you if you say anything about this to anyone.
About NOT raping you...
You told them I raped you  why?
Why should you care?
Its Halfdan the Black
Erik Row What are you doing?
I... I... KILLED her...
I want to die...  No I dont
SHUT UP
Its magic.
You must help us.
Erik the Viking The things you seek are not in our power. We dont make men love each other or hate each other.
You mean wed be dead?
Its SO nice to feel wanted.
Row
I think we should go...
Bjorns not. He could have Bjorns place.
So Halfdan the Blacks using magic is he? Well I have a magic to match his 
What are you talking about Erik?
We must blow the first note... he note that will take us to Asgaard...
Bye Leif.
How did he do that?
Quite... MY lord... said The Prayer of Faith shall have the sick.
Are you all right?
You dont need to feel bad about being seasick you know.
Is it sort of... like a sinking feeling in your stomach?
For your own sake... For the others... I...
Well Come on
Whos that?
What?
Get away Snorri.
You must only let the red rage take hold of you in the thick of battle.
There THATS a true Berserk.
And something to sharpen them with?
And keep your sword greased.
I dont know honey. Its horrible.
Yeah.
I remember you turned around. Your face was dark and your hair was backlit  I could see a halo of frizz  you asked me if things were okay between Naomi and me.
Yeah you told me that later.
Im sorry.
Its okay if I sit closer? So I dont have to scream. Not that I dont need to scream sometimes believe me.  But I dont want to bug you if youre trying to write or something.
 because I go there all the time. I dont think I ever saw you before.
I dont have one.
I noticed your hair. I guess it made an impression on me thats why I was pretty sure I recognized you.
You sure? That doesnt sound 
Oh I doubt thats the case.
My names Clementine by the way.
Huckleberry Hound What are you nuts?
Why wouldnt you think that about me?
You like that?
Well I should probably get going.
Youre really nice. Im sorry I yelled at you before about it. God Im an idiot.
Whats the goal Joel?  My goal Joel is to just let it flow through me? Do you know what I mean? Its like theres all these emotions and ideas and they come quick and they change and they leave and they come back in a different form and I think were all taught we should be consistent. Yknow? You love someone  thats it. Forever. You choose to do something with your life  thats it thats what you do. Its a sign of maturity to stick with that and see things through. And my feeling is thats how you die because you stop listening to what is true and what is true is constantly changing. You know?
I would like you to call me. Would you do that? I would like that.
Tomorrow?
Let me drive you home.
Oh shit. I remember this.  Want to go?
What?
Oh thank God. Its going.
More?
Do you know The Velveteen Rabbit?
What if you hide me?
They found us before. The plan didnt work. I dont know what to do now.
I had you pegged didnt I?
Probably.
You know what I did.
Im Clementine. Can I borrow a piece of your chicken?
You mean like...  Oh my darlin oh my darlin oh my darlin Clementine... ? Huckleberry Hound? That sort of thing?
But my sleeping is really fucked up.
Really? Me too I dont meet people who even know who she is and I work in a book store.
Do you know her poem that starts Seaside gusts of windAnd a house in which we dont live...
What if you stay this time?
Bye Joel.
When?
Listen did you want to make love?
Have sex. Yknow 
Im sorry. I just wanted to say that. This seems like the perfect romantic exotic place to do it and 
Well sounds like me. Sorry man.  Says you were jealous and suspicious.
Yay. Meet me after work by the old mill.
What took you so long?
The driver waved. So casual friendly.
I should maybe talk to you.
Clementine.
I really should go. I really need to catch my ride.
What? What do you mean?
Dont say we when you mean you.
How was it?
Say hi to Rob and Carrie. Have some fun
So... you havent been involved with anyone in all this time?
Miss you too.  I have been seeing someone for a little while.
So Im going to get some sleep. Im glad youre okay.
Oh hey Patrick.
Boo.
Stan... cmon...
I know what it is.
I dont know. I just  there are a lot of really confused people showing up at the office.
Mary...
Okay um theres one that goes Blessed are the forgetful for they get the better even of their blunders.
Yes shit. Oops sorry  Sorry. Its just I told myself I wasnt going to say Pope Alexander and sound like a dope and then I go ahead and do it. Like I psyched myself out.
Its fine Mary. Im happy to hear it.
Ive loved you for a very long time. Im sorry I shouldnt have said that.
What Howard?
Stan? Whats going on?
Okay what happened right before he disappeared?
Ah your journal. This will be invaluable.
You get some sleep Howard. Ill take it from here.
This book  Its essential that people read it because    Its the truth. And only I know it.
Its an apartment.
I wonder if I should invite my girlfriend over too. I have a girlfriend now.
She was beautiful. So sweet and funky and voluptuous. I kind of stole a pair of her panties is what.
Mary hates me. Ive never been popular with the ladies.
Whats your bartletts?
Hold on. Let me ask my friend.  Stan can I leave for a little while? My girlfriend is very 
What was that?
But unlike the clockworks of the Clock People my ticks more accurately echo the ticks of the universe....  ......ha ha ho ho and hee hee.
What do you believe in then?
Suppose that you bear five or six children with your characteristics. All in Siwash Cave. In a postcatastrophe world your offspring would of necessity intermarry forming in time a tribe. A tribe every member of which had giant thumbs. A tribe of Big Thumbs would relate to the environment in very special ways. It could not use weapons or produce sophisticated tools. It would have to rely on its wits and its senses. It would have to live with animals  and plants  as virtual equals. Its extremely pleasant to me to think about a tribe of physical eccentrics living peacefully with animals and plants learning their languages perhaps and paying them the respect they deserve.
Where do you live Miss Hankshaw?
No I guess not.
Chinks the guys name for Christs sake.
But I dont want you to leave. Please stay. We can go to dinner. I owe you a dinner. And tonight... we can... really make love.
To my own special Sissy. Cheers And welcome. So my letter brought ya flying eh? Where were you? Salt Lake City? La Conner? Well I may have a little surprise for you. But first tell me about yourself. Its been six months hasnt it? In some circles thats half a year. How are you?
Thats the very first time in the eons that Ive known you that Ive ever heard you complain. And now youre tired poor darling.
Shit O goodness you wont be thirty for another year and youre more beautiful than ever.
The Food and Drug Administration said Wednesday female deodorant sprays may cause such harmful reactions as blisters burns and rashes. Although the FDA judges that the reported reactions are not sufficient to justify removal of these products from the market they are sufficient to warrant the proposed mandatory label warnings.
Yes well what Im getting at is that there comes a time when it is psychologically impossible for a woman to lose her virginity. She cant wait too long you know. Now theres no reason why you must lose yours. I mean just ponder it a bit thats all.
I can see why they sent you along.
...do you copy?
Holy shit...

Well have to reroute through the port conduit to the APU.

You wanted to see me Admiral?
Its not that simple.  Lyle play the recording for Dr. Weir.
He doesnt belong on this mission. Responsible or not he blames himself. Hes too close to it.  And then theres his wife.
What does?
...is zero. Thats what the singularity does it folds space so that point A and point B coexist in the same space and time. After the ship passes through this gateway space returns to normal.  Its called a gravity drive.
This is Weir.
That means they didnt abandon ship.
Can anybody hear me...
I can run the image through a series of filters try to clean it up.
Thats a negative Starck.
Dr. Weir I need you on the bridge.
I can see that whatre they for?
Any survivors?
Hold on whats this gravitational distortion?
If it worked.
What about it?
We dont get the power back our airs gonna go bad.
...to rescue the crew and salvage the ship. The crew is dead Dr. Weir. This ship killed them. And now its killing us.
Im not asking you to believe me. Youll see for yourself... and so will your crew. Youre all coming with me.
Were all on edge Smith. Were a long way out...
Put it through TACS. Smith you up for a flyby?
Captain Miller...
Sir.
Thank you.
Now what?
Ion drive will engage in... Tminus ten minutes.
Starck why arent you on the bridge?
The Event Horizon sensors show the same thing Bioreadings of indeterminate origin. Right before that wave hit the Clark there was some kind of surge right off the scale but now its back to its previous levels.
Whats the point? Ill just get the same thing...
Who?
Go ahead.
Miller come in...
What?
Im on my way Starck.
Tuck yourself into a crouched position shut your eyes as tight as you can
Weir cant be alive.
BLOW THE FUCKER UP.
First time in a grav couch?
Dont worry about it. Hes hard but hes fair. Youre lucky to be shipping out with him. Hes one of the few Captains in the service with experience in the Outer Reach.
About an hour ago. In medical. I saw my son. He was lying on one of the examination tables and his legs were... 
Theres no one in the corridor but us.
We have to do something oh God...
Jesus that is one big ugly fat fucker...
What?
Range 500 meters and holding. Turbulence is dropping off...
What happened to his eyes?
Why Dr. Weir I think youre in love.
What are you doing?
In our current environment Dr. Weir selfcontrol is an asset.
Were going to have to work on your touch.
We can monitor the clouds approach and observe the tests from here.
He didnt.
He didnt mean it. You know Johnny. Hes always been a hothead 
Where is Reed?
Ben?
Oh my Ggg. What did you... do to Ben?
Good thing it aint workin... Reed what are we doing here? This guys fastfood stripmall science 
Cant do it. I cannot do it.
The shields on the station should protect us.
How long was I out?
You go through something like this makes you appreciate having the right woman in your life.
Glad nothing could take you away from your work.
Reed?... Sue?
They said thats not such a good idea the shock alone could 
I mean you feel a little feverish.
Me likey.
Oh you dawg you. Better not be my nurse
You need to control yourself and think before you 
Wait. You mean theres chance we could be fullon247fantastic?
Youre really cramping my style here.
You two need a timeout.
Im sorry sis for leaving you guys 
Theyre ready for you sir.
Reeds disaster. You know I half think he did this to me on purpose.
Get me on the AM shows Larry King cover of the Journal...  Ive got to do something about this scar. Make sure they only shoot my right side.
Sir Ive always wondered... Why Sue? You could have any woman in the world but 
Youre youve I mean how have you bee
I uh think I remember the number.
Feeling better?
Uh Sue...? I cant.
What?
Okay. Is there any way to duplicate that feeling? Some memory or...
Im sorry Im sorry I didnt mean to do that... You must think that was some kind of latent hostility or 
But were the focus right Reed? Reed...?
And you sure you can control this thing? Last time didnt work out so well.
Reed. How close are we to a cure?
The power... I need... more power... to control... the storm 
Funny how things turn out isnt it?
Ben did this?
But Im not done with the machine 
Victor your scar 
If youre trying to cheer me up youre doing a helluva job 
Reeds gonna fix me up 
Oh man if you could swing something there Id do anything for you. I want to work with you guys.
Im just glad were still together Lisa because I need you this year.
Something happened to them mon.
On the ledge?
I take out the garbage.
Brad what would you say if I asked you to just put these flowers in the trunk of the Cruising Vessel and get rid of them at work?
Its just some guy I met at Swensons. You dont know him.
Are you still a virgin?
Does Mom know you have company?
Yeah. This is it. I have some shopping to do.
Any problems?
Did you throw away those fries Hamilton?
Sometimes I get a ride with my brother. But he usually works in the mornings and then drives to school himself.
You know Mark Ratner really likes you. You like him?
Do you have any ice tea?
I want you to know that its your final decision if we should continue or not.
Oh. Hi.
Why dont you call me up tonight?
Mike You have a mess on C9
You... are a wuss. Part wimp. Part pussy.
I can see it all now. This is going to be just like the girl you fell in love with at Fotomat this summer. You bought forty bucks of fuckin film and you never even talked to her.
Knock it off Damone. I need real help.
Yo.
I hear you brought a film clip with you. Do you want to set it up for us?
Merv this is the action down at Sunset Cliffs at about six in the morning.
We just missed the turnoff to the party.
Face it. With some guys you have to make the first move. A lot of guys are just... wussies.
Stacy what are you waiting for? Youre fifteen. I did it when I was thirteen. Its no huge thing. Its just sex. If you dont one of the other girls will.
I hear some surfer pulled a knife on Mr. Hand this morning.
Was it great?
If he ever calls again Ill say Im eighteen.
I guess Ron hasnt called yet.
Wouldnt penis and balls be the same category?
Of course it was Damone. If it was Ron Johnson youd be out to here
Dont do anything Linda. Id rather just forget about it. I dont even like the guy.
Another summer of working at Swensons.
Sometime?
I cant believe it But what about Doug?
You just ripped my card in two
Hey Wait a minute Theres no birthday party for me here
Am I hallucinating here? Just what in the hell do you think youre doing?
Were you going somewhere tonight Jeff?
Well youll find out next year.
You look like you could still be in high school.
Thanks for picking me up.
Where do you feel like going?
Its very warm out tonight.
Do you know what you want?
Do you mind if I excuse myself for a moment?
Sure. Ill... have another Coke.
Wheres Mike today?
John Bonham?
What confused us was Dr. Gonzos signature on the telegram from Los Angeles. When we knew he was right here in the hotel.
Of course I could hear what the Clerk was really saying...
Certainly Mr. Duke
Mr. Duke? Hello Mr. Duke Im sorry we were cut off a moment ago... I thought I should call again because I was wondering...
Naw Thats science fiction stuff
What do you mean by that?
I want you to understand that this man at the wheel is my attorney Hes not just some dingbat I found on the Strip. Hes a foreigner. I think hes probably Samoan. But it doesnt matter does it? Are you prejudiced?
Or just think it? Was I talking? Did they hear me?
What the fuck are we doing out here? Somebody call the police We need help
You better be careful. Plenty of vultures out here. Theyll pick your bones clean before morning.
Thats good...
Why?
This is the place. Theyll never fuck with us here.
Some angry Rotarian shoves you and you think Whats happening here? Whats going on? Then you hear yourself mumbling.
What limes?
Have you made a deal with him? Did you put him on to her?
Of course Im your attorney Ill give you all the time you need at my normal rates 45 an hour  but youll be wanting a cushion so why dont you just lay one of those 100 bills down there beside the radio and fuck off?
Jesus.
You bastard Youd do that wouldnt you?
Lucy.
NO I felt sorry for the girl I wanted to help her
I gave the cabbie an extra ten bucks to make sure she gets there safe. Also I told him Id be there myself in an hour and if she wasnt Id come back out here and rip his lungs out.
Like big lizards.
Yeh naked... except for the weapons.
No shes looking for you.
OK goddamnit... Look... Ill call her. Ill get her off our backs. Youre right. Shes my problem.
There was nothing in the atmosphere of the North Star to put me on my guard...
Dont take any guff from those swine. Remember if you have any trouble you can always send a telegram to the Right People.
Okay. Heres how it is. What goes into my book as of noon is that I apprehended you... for driving too fast and advised you to proceed no further than the next rest area... your stated destination right? Where you plan to take a long nap. Do I make myself clear?
Not my jurisdiction. The city limits are two point two miles beyond the rest area. Can you make it that far?
Bullshit Youre just as much a part of it as they are
Come on baby dont try to tell us you never heard of the Grange Gorman.
Stop
YOURE KILLING HIM
You cant keep me here. This is bullshit. Fuckin bullshit. This is fucking BULLSHIT
We should go We should go right now
Are you two all right? Did you see that? They left We made it I think we made it
Well meet in three hours?
Where are you two going?
Sorry didnt mean to scare you.
I think I know where a CB is.
Okay now. Easy steps. Easy breaths. Easy steps.
Thats the oldest of the bunch looked like the Grandpapa. We caught the little one Junior in the cooler there. As weve seen what he lacks in size he more than makes up for in speed.
Jesus Christ Im gonna have a stroke.
What tunnel? Where?
HEY No Im not trusting him either thats why you and I will both be going with him.
You seem mighty collected about this.
Scared?
Id love to be macho but this is a pants wetter from all angles.
So what now? Did those things leave?
What now Geronimo?
My truck cant be more than ten feet away. We load into the back I can get in the front and we roll out of here.
How are you holding up?
Oh no.
Wait before you do that help me to the kitchen I need to lay down. Theres a cot back there.
What? Really?
Hes dead.
Open?
This one will just stun ya but this one will put ya to sleep.

Did we make it?
I like your looks. You have the classical bone structure of the very great beauties... Garbo Dietrich 
No Im concerned with everything.
Hi Frances got a minute?
Yes but... Really I hate to sound... its just that the public expects something different from its stars. People wont take you seriously.
Youre afraid
Madam...?
Okay but come here first.
Hey wheres the fire sister?
Cool off beautiful. Didnt you see the sign says Dimout Zone?  Theres a war on you know?
Get your clothes on.

Youre poisoning that childs mind.
Lillian... Im more than willing to meet you halfway.
Kurt
Age?
Only if you were in it. Are you?
Why?
Ill... take your word for it. So who are you then?
Oh yeah I saw you in the newsreel

Yeah its a gift. You gotta do something with it.
How ya doin Farmer?
But... but why Harry...? Whyd they do it?
Well shes back to earth now. Theyre all pretty huffed up about your leaving. I think you better go back kid.
Frances youre a movie star now. If you give them what they want you can get anything.
Tell you what. Lets ditch the limo. Let me drive you up to that red carpet in my beat up Chevy.
Harry? Harry where are you?
Two lines Two fucking lines My wife returns from Europe tomorrow. I cant see you any more. Just like that
Oh my God I look awful.
Evening gorgeous.
Harry I have to go home. I have to talk to Mama.

To quarterhorses.
Theres just one more thing.
You give up on her?
Anyway... if you need me...
Frances Frances

This is it kid. This is our chance. When you got a chance you better take it.
You dont need to screw around anymore. You dont need Dwayne Steele or Odets or your mother. You need me.
Sure I did thats why Im here.
Dad too. I sold the house. Im a faceless sinner Harry...
Its going to be slow from now on. Do you know what I mean Harry?
Pretty morning.
Shit
...Is that not true?
Miss Farmer In light of your flagrant disregard for the conditions of your probation coupled with the unwarranted assault on the Plaintiff here... I am forced to order you to begin serving a sentence of 180 days in the County Jail.
And whats the title of this seduc... assault?
Thats me Clifford.
Im not
But how do I know you love me?
You think I got it?
Mama...
What?
Ill have lunch ready by one.
Dont... talk crazy.
Youre not going anywhere
No All youve done is try to break my spirit try to turn me into you But Im not you mother and I never will be and thank god for it  That goes for you too And frankly I dont know how with the two of you I turned out as sane as I am   Wait right there gentlemen Ill be with you in a minute... and believe me I dont want to stay here one second longer than I have to  But Ive got to tell you Lillian that one day before you die you will realize what youve done and hang your head in shame. In shame
Yes...?
I dont believe so.
Im glad to see you havent lost your sense of humor.
You may discuss my predicament Doctor. You may discuss it with anyone you like but not with me. Im not interested. I can solve my problems without recourse to a veternarian.
This whole thing is a joke
Not at all. She brought me my fan mail.  I had no idea there were so many strangers concerned about me. But I guess thats the best thing about working in the movies. You make so many friends. I want to go back and show them that the faith they put in me wasnt a mistake.
I dont know why they even bother. Shes had enough of this to knock sense into a bull elephant.
And he drove me to mine.
Im glad you finally came to the door. A man shouldnt have to scurry in the shadows.
It cant be as bad as that.
Friends? Do they live around here?
Come warm yourself if you like.
Yes I speak. And read. And think... and know the ways of Man.  Ive been waiting for you. Two months now.
Evil?  Do you believe in evil?
Why Victor? Why? What were you thinking?
And if I consent?
This was not taken from a grave.
Shes beautiful.
Somethings wrong. I know it.  Ive heard rumors of cholera spreading south from Hamburg.
I should go. I should leave today.
Are you all right?
What does it say?
Claude rode over there to see if held lost track of time. They say he never arrived.
Smell the air. Wonderful.
You will.  What do you want Victor?
You make me weak.
Captain I implore you. The men are frightened and angry. They want your assurance.
Im convinced. Not by treating symptoms but by diving natures most jealouslyguarded secrets.
Professor?
Now youve got him started.
...yes and thanks to him smallpox has been virtually eliminated. Ive heard this speech before.
Quite a place.
Yes. I took refuge in the barn. Wouldnt you? Lost in the storm? Freezing and wet? I was exhausted and could search no longer.
I have always loved him.
Krempe has a way of provoking my temper.
To say the least. I came here to expand my mind but honest inquiry seems strangled at every turn. All we do is cling to the old knowledge instead of seeking the new.
Why? God alone knows what it means. Until it has proven value its nothing more than a ghoulish parlor trick. Hardly fit for the classroom.
Victor. He was trying to be gracious.
Frostbite. Gangrene. A simple diagnosis.
Ah. An explorer.
Creature? A... human like creature?
So young so pretty. What monster could have done such a thing?
Cabin B is ready.
Thats got her. Thanks. Im Steve Christy. Welcome to Camp Crystal Lake. You got some grubby clothes? Climb into em. Alice see if Bill has cleaned out the boathouse. I want him to start with the canoes. What happened to Brenda?
You draw very well.
Next Friday.
Jack and Marcie are gonna be drenched.
Help you clean up?
I dont hear it anymore.
Whats the matter with it?
I wouldnt know.
Somebodys there Barry.
Lets go back Barry...
What the hell?
This is almost like the one at my uncles cabin in Maine.
Ill be okay. Holy shit...
Floor probably leaks. This area is full of springs.
You ever fire one of those bows again and Ill tack you up on the wall to dry.
No wonder they lost America. How could you sneak around in the bushes wearing that? Whats to eat?
What hath God wrought?
Like waves. Its never been likes waves before.
Cowboy.
Last line of Gone With the Wind?
Yeah. I got it on before this    all started.
What was that?
No but I passed by it a couple of times. Its out in the middle of nowhere. It seems like a rowdy place so there wouldnt be a lot of police. And its open from dusk till dawn. You said meet you in the morning.
What about Kate?
Son I have this situation under control. I know exactly what Im doing. Youre going to have to trust me on this.
Why did they block the door again?
Whats the story with you two? You a couple of fags?
How does that happen? You dont look Japanese.
Oh well excuse me all to hell.
My children are not going with you and thats that.
Yes.
Howd she die?
Come on gimme some more details. Howd it happen? Some fuckin drunk kill her?
Died instantly?
Then?
Out of the stew pot and into the fire.
Why not against your religion?
What are you going to do?
I dont know about that. In order for it to have any power I think its gotta be an official crucifix.
Did he...?
I promise.
Richie will you do me a favor and eat my pussy?
What?
Mexico.
What did I say?
You got three minutes. One second longer I shoot your father in the face. Do you understand what I just said?
Watch my back
See ya.
 see this television
For the time being we are very confident we will apprehend the fugitives in the next fortyeight hours. The Bureau local law enforcement and the Texas Rangers have all joined forces in forming a dragnet to snare Seth and Richard Gecko.
Theyll probably make a run for the border which would bring em this way. And if we get our hands on those shit asses were talking payback time. Well get em all right. I gotta piss. Im gonna use your commode.
What dya mean?
What the fuck was that about?
Start the car.
Richie? You okay?
Do they have an Xrated channel?
Is it me? Is it my fault?
Yes Seth I understand.
Yeah when you fell your head smacked the toilet hard. It scared the shit outta me. Sure youre okay?
Im lookin scared?
You know what you look like?
Hes right Kate. Daddys dead He was too far away. If flinging that door and filling this room with those batthings would save him Id fling it. The only thing itll do is turn us into one of them.
Can I ask you somethin lieutenant? How come youre doing this?  I mean were kinda curious.
Commander are you of the habit of letting photographers traipse around your base snappin their fill? These were supposed to have been discreet test cases 
Well seeins how this thing is out you let me handle the r.p.m.  From this point forward I want all press matters coordinated via my office. Ill be goddamned if Im gonna watch Hayes pull flowers out of his ass and take credit for this one. Him or the President.  This my shade?  Midnight Mahogany? Cuz Im comin dangerously close to lookin like Ronald Reagan here.
No sir WHAT?
Then good night.
I dont know of any delicate way to say this lieutenant so I wont try.  Claims have been made that you have engaged in fraternization  of the samesex variety.  Specifically that you were...  ... seen leaving the apartment of another female officer at such a time and in such a manner as to suggest conduct unbecoming.
Sir.  If tomorrow... I was not under your command... would the inquiry still go forward?
Shit.  Think were had.
Banditos on the east perimeter  150 yards  Shit she was part of it
Yes?
The Navys conclusion regarding the crash of an F14 aboard an aircraft carrier.  Female aviator it just so happens.  Youre familiar with this report and its conclusion am I right?
The commission concluded that the aviator in question failed to execute a proper approach to the carrier.
Captain Dwyer.  Technically.
Uh question maam.
Jordan.  I always hoped wed get together  though just now Im gearing up for a childcare vote that 
So?  Isnt the President jumping on your bandwagon?
What are you saying?  That a womens life is more valuable than a mans? That a womens death hurts a family more?
Ive had no direct communication with him since this whole thing began.  And thats quite verifiable.
Really dont wanna be captured el tee.  Heard some bad things.
Six oclock  Marking marking
Shes an officer.  Theres a higher standard.
Of course it is.  And Im gonna stay on her until everyone realizes this is not some bullshit equalrights thing that real lives are gonna be lost.  Maybe mine maybe yours.
Automatic fivesecond deduction which slips you under the wire. Its called gendernorming ONeil  standard procedure for all females in physical training courses.  Where you been the last few years?
Just a coincidence?
Chances of recovery?
That was good headwork lieutenant.
So whyre you even considering it? Are you?
You know Royce I got enough heat on me without you turning up the jets too.
Still cant make up your mind huh? Gotta go Royce.
John James Urgayle.  The Chief.
Instructors typically pull three year assignments.  This guys in and out in one year  your year.  That sound right?
Wickwire Thomas Dane... Second run at Coronado... and correct they had him stashed in the Appropriation Liaison Office whatever that is.
Id sure like to know who.
It was made clear.  Anyway stay ballsy.  First weeks hell then it levels out.  Until S.E.R.E. training anyway.  Thats hellandahalf.
Hey.  Way to gut it out.
Wick.  They got your crew too?
Nah they were deadass asleep.  But on every guards chestthey left one Marlboro cigarette.  Just a little calling card to say theyd been there  and could come back any time they wanted.
Do you uh know...
Were going over to her place to make salad and pasta.  Just you know nothing special.
Say again sir?
Chief sir I dont understand why 
Sir someone mentioned you received the Navy Cross.  May I ask what you got it for?
You are in the cage ONeil.  Right here right now.
Thats what your crew said.  Are they lying?  Or are you?
Anybody usin these drawers here?
WOULD YOU JUST GET OUTTA HERE?
I just wonder how that happened.
You dont suppose this is just part of...
This aint workin right
Audreys going to stay with us tonight.
Wheres Audrey?
My God. Hes going after the nest.
Animal I cant.
What are you doing?
Cut uptown take 8th to 57th then cut up Broadway.
Audrey? Is that you? Hi hello. You look wow uh howve you been?
So you made it.
That was eight years ago. Some people change you know.
Blood sample? How close did you get to that thing?
Is this cause of me? Because of the story?
Circuits are overloaded.
Who was that French guy anyway.
And Im supposed to remind you to call him on all of Caimans expense p.o.s.
I cant believe he put the moves on me. After everything Ive done for him.
Did Romeo have a name?
Your old sweetheart?
The warm feeling of helping your fellow man.
I cant.
You dont understand I can get us information...
Hi. Nick Tatopoulos...
Evacuate Manhattan? Thats over three million people. Has that ever been done before?
They didnt make it.
And how should we do that Sir?
Who are they? Lieutenant get those people away from there.
You didnt answer my question. In fact for the last 18 hours no one has answered any of my questions.
Somebody must have seen it.
Do you have any idea whats going on out there? The phones are ringing off the hook with people screaming to be let back into the city.
Are you looking for this?
We know.
So why all the secrecy? Why arent you guys working with the US military?
It is my job to protect my country. Sometimes I must even protect it from itself. From mistakes we have made. Mistakes that we do not want the world to know about.
Whats with the chewing gum?
Who the hell are you?
Dr. Lazarus... I hope that Im not breaching protocol but.. I am so very humbled to stand in your presence... I have studied your missions extensively... Though I am Thermian I have lived my life by your philosophy by the code of the Maktar.
Just as on your home planet sir. If I may say it took me three years to master the spikes but now I sleep with a peace I never thought possible...
God what an ass.
About this much.
Go ahead
Jason before we entered the black hole my instruments detected strange energy surge from Sarris shiD similar to...
Hes a twit
He wants to THINK?
This is ludicrous.  Why are you listening to this man?  Must I remind you that he is wearing a costume not a uniform?...  Hes no more equipped to lead us than THIS fellow.  No offense.
Oh Alex get away from that thing...
May I get the check?
Those blue things ate everybody here?
Back there. You said the Commander is down there with a bunch of cannibals.
Hi Brandon.
Oh.  Okay.

How did you come to that conclusion?
What?  Up?
The ship is sustaining structural damage.
The enemy is matching velocity.
Negative no reserve Beryllium sphere exists onboard.
Weve got to get that valve turned off. Their oxygen Is almost gone...
It doesnt have to be a hologram... Just a diversion.
Assault on Voltareck III.  Episode... 31 I think.

Listen Id like to but frankly.. Im not even sure where it is or even...
Is it a bomb?  A booby trap?  Tell me
Wait. What did you say?
My name is Jason Nesmith. Im an actor. Were all actors.
We.. We lie.
Accelerate to Mark 4 Tommy.
Commander I must speak to you. It is a matter of supreme importance... We are Thermians from the Klatu Nebula and we require your help. I beseech you to come with us back to our ship. A great many lives hang in the balance...
Commander?... Where are you... going?
Theramin.
But what if Sarris survives?
He has a very powerful ship. Perhaps you would like to wait to see the results of
An interstellar vox.
How can we thank you Commander. You You have saved our people.
Deception... Lies.

Go on... I want to hear everything.
After visiting Congress I know what its like being violated by come disproportionate asses  Ah if she only knew that the most important men in the country  possibly the world  are sitting at this table...
There was this anonymous pamphlet circulated at Congress which says I am personally responsible for all our hardships.  And... that I have encouraged the people of America to make me into a God  Benedict it says that I have gone mad
These men were taken from their homes at night tried by Reeds courts  which Congress recognizes  and well you can see.
Colonel sir Mrs. Washington inquires if you are going to join her for dinner?
You you just need a new flint General.
What?  What are you talking about?
Negroes?  Washington has black men in his army?  Are they good fighters?  Whats that red ribbon on his arm Colonel?
What the goddamned hell do you think you are doing?
Who is that?

General Greene is here.  There are two other divisions here.
Yessir.

With your support Horatio.  As one of our own who has seen combat with the British your opinion counts.
They are... friends of Congress.
Lets not over do it...
Partially...
A grand scheme?

Did you know that Jefferson has proposed a law in Virginia aiming at an absolute separation of state from the church?
Leave me now sir I am tired.
We cant take them.  Are you all right?
Sir if you dont mind my saying I dont understand your history at all.  I mean why would you want to win the war?  Youre not after glory like Benedict...  Youre a slave owner and yet you invite blacks to fight in your army.
At one time I could have chosen not to be.
We can grow three primary crops in a season and if we have some luck we get a forth.  The temperature is generally mild.
Cranes?  Who needs to walk like a crane?

Im looking at you.
Thats what Im doing.

Come on Harry  Mesas? The worst they might do is get a judgment against you uttering a bad check. I cant imagine you want that to happen man in your position.
I imagine in your line of work there were times you had to get rough you know say one of your customers stopped paying.
Murray Saffrin guy who wrote it did all my Grotesque pictures had it in a drawer for twenty years. He shows it to me one day tells me hes got a star interested would I produce it.

You dont say any moren you have to. You say Well Im glad you assholes stopped by so I can set you straight.
What?
Thats the difference between you and me Harry. I say what I mean. I want something from someone I ask em straight out. I want Martin Weir I go get Martin Weir. I dont fuck around with his trainers shrink.
Really.
So how bout it Mr. Selznick do I make my deal with Bo? Or you gonna finally help me out have a word with your dry cleaner when you find him.
Harry if I gave you Leos money youd have Ray Bones all over your ass and then youd be in a whole new kinda trouble.
Bullshit. E.g. is short for ergo.
Im thinking of a movie.
One were producing.
I turn it on when I confront the guy.
So when do I meet up with the husband and give him the look?
You take all my money but youre borrowing part of it?
Mr. Barboni is a good customer.  Works for Jimmy Capp.
Well basically this guy owes a shylock fifteen thousand plus hes a few weeks behind on the vig the interest you have to pay.
Ripped nylons work. Makes the shot more real.
How come you stopped making movies with Harry?
You read Harrys new one? He says its the best thing hes ever read.
Tell you what Ill stop by Harrys office and pick up a copy for you.
So what about your story. You thought of a title yet?
Yeah?
You dont mean a movie star? More like a character actor?
Harry... My God...
I hate to say I told you but I did. I told you dont start nothing with him that time.
Whatre you talking about? You wanna be a movie star?
How you gonna do that? You dont know shit about making movies.
Yeah but whose point of view?
I miss Murray Harry.
So this means youve reconsidered our deal on Mr. Lovejoy?
Anyone skim the pool? It needs it.
How did you get in the house?
That Miami flight that went down it was on the news every day for about a week. Harry mustve been busy.
With your experience you could always become an agent. Right Harry?
Well. I got an audition tomorrow.
The three hundred large. What other money is there?  I should keep quiet I know till Ive read the script but Ive got a feeling about this one. Im that shylock.
Karen. Wow. Look at you...
Lufkin. His... agent.
North Island please repeat? Over.
Arctic Warrior Arctic Warrior Arctic Warrior. This is United States Coastguard Station North Island. Your radio check is affirmative. Over.
Fucker
Damn mind of its own.
Wheres his boat then? Wheres his crew? He aint gonna be out here by himself thats for damn sure.
The turbine blew.
Seeing as though a foot of one of these fuckers weighs about a hundred pounds it aint gonna be what youd call easy.  Any questions?
Maybe that is his boat.
What say Epps? You up for some roasted albatross?
With a little extra fuel weather permitting we should make Sitka in five days without another stop.
How long then?
So whatre we gonna do. Thats the big question right?
Then were rich. Were damn filthy stinking rich.
You better get down here quick skipper. Im on C deck. Cabin 400.
Theres no way were gonna hide a few thousand pounds of gold from the Coastguard here. Besides itll be safer where it is.
Take it easy willya? What about the radio?
What the fuck  ?
I didnt touch the fucking radio  Ever occur to you theres somebody else on that boat skipper?
Well stand the watch on deck tonight. Youre up first.
Morning everybody.
Looks like one hell of a stick up his ass.
Stay away. Or else.
What?
The laws on our side. If they want to challenge it let them try.
Maybe they didnt want it back. Maybe the whole fat deal was insured.
Who?
What? What the hellre you talking about.
Theyre dead in the water that morning. Four hours later the captains relieved of his command. And that evening they issue a general SOS.
Smashed it up pretty bad.
The pages missing. Then their SOS was real.
Maybe the other ship took the worst of it.
Its a good bet theyll be asking a lot of questions when they get here too.
Hey.
The what?
What happened.
No. I think they are were just passengers. Innocent victims.
Murphy to Epps.
Nope.
Epps? You there?
Over the gold.
They went crazy.
Greer to Murphy.
Yeah.
All we got to do is hit some rough weather and you can forget about it.
Greek citizen. Merchant navy.  Obviously we arent the first to come across this ship. They probably stumbled across it just like we did.
Its a Noaa buoy.
He took the shotgun and a light.
What about the gold?
Now hold up just a minute. Lets be reasonable here.
Nobodys going anywhere with that gold now. Anybody tries to board well know about it.  You can do what you want Greer. But neither of us is gonna risk saving your ass down here if it comes to that.
What seems to be the trouble ladies?
No no. You got leak.
That cost me twenty grand at least.
Have you seen my blue spatula?
Will you get off my back for once?
Guess.
Someone from the past.
I was in a horrible mood  tell her not to worry Ill be completely out of her life in a few days.
Whats wrong with you? Tell him Im not here
Im so excited to see this film  Dustoffvarnya is such a brilliant director Did you see his last film The Flower That Drank The Moon? It was simply glorious
II honestly never intended for this to happen...
Enid and I were just friends. You know... we feel comfortable around each other... she really likes my old records and...
Oh my goodness... well the whole thing is just ridiculous and as soon as the school board is back in session next Fall Im going to do everything I can to help you.

Authentic 50s diner? Since when were there minimalls in the 1950s?
Jesus Listen to this one Do you remember me? Airport shuttle June 7th. You striking redhead with yellow dress pearl necklace brown shoes. I was the bookish fellow in the green cardigan who helped you find your contact lens. Am I crazy or did we have a moment?
I know. And hes like psychotically obsessing over every little detail.
God I think Josh is too mature for us.
Look maybe thats him
Is he wearing a green cardigan?
Whats going on now? Whats he doing?
Whats he doing now?
Hes insane
Ew look at this...
Not really...
Funky?
Thats who people want to rent to. Its a known fact that its way easier to get a job and everything if youre rich... All we have to do is buy a few semiexpensive outfits and act like its no big deal... itll be fun.
Where are we going?
What was that all about?
I didnt get it either.
How about this one?
Ew ... when did you get that?
You wont believe it Guess
God how can you stand all these assholes?
At least the wheelchair guy is sort of entertaining...
You hang out with me because nobody else can stand to be around you.
Youre gross.  See that guy?
Havent you heard about the miracle of masturbation?
Anyway now we can start looking for the apartment...  Do you remember when we first came up with that whole idea of renting our own apartment?
I remember our big plan was as soon as we got the apartment we were going to trick Daniel Dusentrieb into coming over and then fuck him.
What are you talking about? What kind of loser gets fired after one day?
What was that all about? I thought everything must go
I am not  I just think itd be funny to see what hed do...
Yeah but maybe one of us should at least try...
Dont you want nice stuff?
Actually Im just about to go out with some friends...
When was this?
Oh yeah I can tell you really love it
Youre the psycho You havent been able to deal with anything since high school ended
My acting workshop is across the street from here. Im just on my break.
I want to know what you think youre doing staying out all night and worrying your father to death
Perhaps the Jaminator appeals to you.  Absolutely no practice necessary.  You shread like a giant. Just press a button.
Do you have any other old records besides these?
You still interested in that?
Punk rock is over
Oh how punk.
...are you waiting for a bus?
Well if it isnt Enid and Rebecca the little Jewish girl and her Aryan friend.
Thanks for the tape  Ill have to pay you later Im broke.
Thats five hundred dollars.
You know like weird 1960s Indian rock n roll music.
Theres some good stuff in here... do you like old music?
Is this one any good?
Yeah thats good too... the whole record was good but that one song Devil Got My Woman  I mostly just keep playing that one over and over... Do you have any other records like that?
Yeah sure I guess...
What was all that stuff about enlarged holes and tight cracks?
Really? Can I see it?
God look at this poster  I cant believe this room Youre the luckiest guy in the world Id kill to have stuff like this
Im talking to you... Ill bet there are tons of women who would go out with you in a minute
What about her? Would you go out with her?
Wow Look at all these creeps
Uh I dont have much money with me right now.
Relax Seymour relax...
Its not hopeless...
Yeah well I cant relate to humanity either but I dont think its totally hopeless...
Im not sure I have anything to drink... there might be some 
Wow this is so cool...
What the fuck Seymour? What is this?
Actually I was a whole lot more interested in the Cooks phenomenon when I was about your age. Ive kind of lost interest since Ive been working for them...
Nothing so glamorous... actually Im an assistant manager at their corporate headquarters.
So I dont really get it  are you saying that things were better back then  even though there was stuff like this?
Yeah well youre not the only one. Everybody I know has totally fucked up problems... It seems like only stupid people have good relationships...
Actually Ive got a total crush on this one guy right now but its a really fuckedup situation...
I wonder if you really like all these old records or if you only like the fact that nobody else likes them?
Seymour I promise you that wasnt a joke  you have to call her back
Well when can we do something?
I dont know... Im sorry but Danas a very jealous person. I just dont want to screw that up right now... Im sure shell dump me soon and we can go back to being friends...
Whats up?
Uh... sure... come in.
Thats Danas  Im supposed to be saving it for our twomonth anniversary. You better not 
If you expect the worst youre never disappointed.
Youre a beautiful young girl... I cant imagine you would ever have had any interest in me except as an amusingly cranky eccentric curiosity.
I was just thinking out loud...  I mean youve got this whole thing with Dana  Im not going to let you fuck that up...
Please Josh?
So Josh if this guy freaks out will you protect us?
I agree.
I can see that... now what can you tell us about it? First of all what kind of sculpture is this?
Very good. Now what can you tell us about it in regard to your artistic intent?
This shocking image of repressed femininity
Uh do you mind if I wait? I really need to talk to her.
He sees this chaos hell replace you all.
Morning friend glorious day.
Youve never built in Africa.
Lovely sound they seem happy.
Awhile back he ordered some bibles  Ive brought them.  Is he here?
And it worked?
Let me explain about time youve been here three months and already two months behind. And the Germans and the French are gearing up. And I dont care about you and I dont care about the thirty dead I care about my knighthood and if this railroad finishes on schedule Ill get my knighthood and I want it.  Professional hunters may be the answer.
I know its your first day and of course you must be tired from the journey  but what are you going to do about it?
then he feasted on him starting with his feet
Silliest thing I ever heard of why in the world should we go through all that?
I tried to be late John it would have been easier if youd gone.
oh please if Id been against your taking this you would have abandoned me. Youve been desperate to see Africa your whole life.
Dont much like them.
Anything special about them?
We all have our reasons. Mine is simply to make them understand happiness accept salvation know the serenity that comes  best I stop. One of the byproducts of my belief is that I can become amazingly boring. But I know God smiles on me.
Finish your tour?
You said of course youd need the donkey. Why of course?
What a good week.
Got me out of trouble.
Have you got it?
...misfire... it jammed...
Where could it have gone? How could it get across the water?  Theyre only lions yes?
How many do you think theyve killed?
The workers dont get on?
For you.
Why do you laugh? you dont believe she taught me?
How many cattle?
Well be very sorry to lose you.  Perhaps I could take you to lunch today?
Janosz?
Time is running out Dana.  Soon it will be midnight and the city will be mine  and Vigos.  Well mainly Vigos.  But we have a spectacular opportunity to make the best of our relationship.
Venkman?  I think he was borderline for a while there.  Then he crossed the border.
Thats where the buggy stopped.
I wish I could stay.  I feel personally responsible for you being here.
Youre really good you know.
Im sure you didnt come here just to talk about art.
He was also a lunatic and a genocidal madman. I hate this painting.  Ive felt very uncomfortable since they brought it up from storage.
Who could blame him?  Were you wearing this nightgown?
Be careful on that sofa  its a buttbiter. But the beds good and I just changed the sheets so if you get tired feel free.  In fact I think you should definitely plan on spending the night here.
Did you happen to see some shirts on the floor in here?
So  are you making any New Years resolutions?
Im not even good for me.
I received this information from an alien.  I was at the Paramus Holiday Inn I was having a drink in the bar when he approached me and started talking.  Then he must have used some sort of ray or a mind control device because he made me follow him to his room and thats where he told me about the end of the world.
Before you go running to the newspapers with this would you consider telling this slime thing to some people downtown?
Pleasure to meet you.  Ive seen you on television.
We dont go around altering valuable paintings Dr. Venkman.
Dr. Venkman?  Dana is not here.
I Vigo the scourge of Carpathia 
 the sorrow of Moldavia 
Your honor may I approach the bench?
This is my cousin Sherman.  Sherm say hello to the Ghostbusters.  I promised him a ride in the car if he got you out.
Hi welcome back to the World of the Psychic Im Peter Venkman and Im chatting with my guest author lecturer and of course psychic Milton Anglund.  Milt your new book is called The End of the World.  Isnt that kind of like writing about gum disease.  Yes it could happen but do you think anybody wants to read a book about it?
So what are you saying?  That the world of the supernatural is your special province?
Id like to have a stool specimen
Its working.  The positive GeVs are climbing.
So far so good.
Nothing.  Not a trace.
Hey I didnt imagine it.  There must have been ten thousand gallons of it down there.
Im Egon 
Six feet  seven  eight 
Weve found it at every event site weve been to lately.
Rivers of the stuff
Late Renaissance I think.  Caravaggio or Brunelleschi.
Great.  So what are you guys working on?
Who?
Who?  Who?  Who?
Geez I forgot how heavy these things are.
Im Ray 
Beautiful beautiful.  Work with me baby. Just have fun with it.  Okay hes playing it cool.  Lets finish up and get out of here.
What happened?
I dont think they make Nikes in her size.
Are you telling me how to drive?
Are you all right?
What are we doing?  Ray I was ready to kill you.
It better not start yet.  Im trying to finish my potholder before lunch.
Arent you glad we waited?
Oh no I feel great.  I just ordered some more vitamins.  I see you were exercising. So was I.  I taped 20 Minute Workout and played it back at high speed so it only took ten minutes and I got a really good workout. You wanna have a mineral water with me?
You know you shouldnt leave your TV on so loud when you go out.  That creep down the hall phoned the manager.
Are you the Gatekeeper?
Like a used car salesman.
Thats too bad.
Uhhuh.
I dont have to take abuse from you.  I have other people dying to give it to me.
Whos the stiff?
Cant you tell me now?
All right.  Since you put it that way.
Hey Dana.  What is it?  What happened?
He is the Destructor.
Do you want this body?
I dont know.  Youve got two people in there already.  It could get a little crowded.  I want you to close your eyes and relax.  Now Im going to speak to Dana and I want Dana to answer.
But why?  The students love us
Hello Im Roger Delacorte  the Head Librarian.  Are you the men from the University?
Egon theres something very strange about that man.  Im very psychic usually and right now I have this terrible feeling that something awful is going to happen to you.  Im afraid youre going to die.
In the physical sense.
Why dont you step into the office and well talk about it.  Hold all my calls Janine.
Heres the paper on the Brooklyn job.  She paid with a Visa card.
And someone from the EPA is here to see you.
I see.  And now you catch ghosts?
All right.  What is it?
Hey  Im getting a little tired of this.
Yes?
Spengler are you serious about actually catching a ghost?
Generally you dont see that kind of behavior in a major appliance.  What do you think Egon?
Did you see anything?
He wants to shut down the storage grid.
Yes.  After the First World War Shandor decided that society was too sick to survive.  And he wasnt alone.  He had close to a thousand followers when he died.  They conducted rituals bizarre rituals intended to bring about the end of the world.
Look at the structure of the roof cap.  It looks exactly like the kind of telemetry tracker NASA uses to identify dead pulsars in other galaxies.
Excuse me for a minute.  Ray Im right in the middle of something here.  Can you come back in about an hour?
Sure.  Thats great Ray.  I think you should get down there right away and check it out.  Let me know what happens.
I told you its real.
Anything  Just make contact.
Do you know what a patent clerk makes?  I liked the University.  They gave us money they gave us the facilities and we didnt have to produce anything  Ive worked in the private sector.  They expect results. Youve never been out of college.  You dont know what its like out there.
Youre not going to lose the house. Everybody has three mortgages these days.
But most people are afraid to even report these things.
How was your date?
Im getting high readings near the air vents.  It must be using the duct system to get around.  See I told you wed get something.
Agile bastard isnt he?
AND YOU CAME UP WITH THAT?
Hey man.  What is it youre so involved with there?
Ray do you remember something in the Bible about a day when the dead would rise up from their graves?
I should at least have you dont you think?
Did Narcissus die today?  Wasnt this his day to die?
For the gods spit it out
Where have you been?
You must start clearing everything with me  especially your lovers.
Then youd be out of a job.
Im ordering a general standdown in preparation for withdrawal back across the Danube.
AGH  Please  Hes having a secret device constructed for the circus. The brass craftsmen are working overtime.
So tell me what happened between you and the emperor?  What really happened on the German front?  You know the Senates arguing your case...
The Emperor and I are bound by the threads of The Fates.  He was born on August thirtyfirst you know.
Would you support the Senate if they would give you a trial?  Youd have to give me your word.
Youre a citizen and a soldier.  Not a gladiator.
No futuretelling please Ive been terrified enough for one day.
How do you know I am playing?  Well the clown is always harmless.  Isnt that right?  And how did you ever get to know me so well?  The last we spent any time together I was fourteen.  I think you know me better than my father.  Hes going to die isnt he?
Its my brothers neck you want not mine.
To think I brought my daughters up on all things Roman.  Read to sleep on Catullus Lucretius... Virgil... every night.  My beautiful daughters.
Commodus its we who are going on the offensive.
I want you to start your work for the last phase of the campaign.
Its not because hes young its because hes ignorant and arrogant. His sister is a better man.  Thats why I have undertaken to begin sweeping changes in the relationship between the emperor and the Senate.
The Senators admire you.
They fear change.  The new Caesar must be honest enough to know when the emperorship is no longer feasible.  You could be the one the Emperor the man who oversees the rebirth of the Republic.
Why dont we try to keep politics out of the conversation.
On his death bed I promised Marcus I would complete our work here.  The Senate may be vacillating but I have the army behind me.  Im taking half a cohort and restocking that fort.
Then give the empire back to the people... the children who will grow up to become senators...
Hes very realistic.
Well you wanted the girls to have the best teachers.
You need to come home
Very fancy.  Did you design the bottle?
Im a soldier  were at war.  I cant stay home tending the damned olive groves?
When you get to Ostia use this  bribe passage to Africa or Spain. Save my family.  You should be able to find a merchant ship that will take you to Egypt then to Numidia.
Thank you.  What is going to happen tomorrow?  Exactly?
Take your hands off me animal
General do you realize what happened out there today?
You put this inside your shirt  when Tiger stabs your stomach  its full of pigs blood.  Gushes out everywhere  Its really impressive.  Fantastic  Better than the real thing
You get to come alive again in the country
Tell me honestly since this may be our last earthly meeting  if this were a fair fight where would you put your money?
They want to dump Tiger and have me endorse their damned chariot right? They dont waste time...
I want another interview with Cos. Tell him to bring plenty of ink.
Commodus must hate you.  Free your gladiators and come with us.
Youre living at home now. Is that right?
Will you take me home now?
I think Id better go home now please.
Listen  could you stop crying please?
We wont. Lets go inside.
Where we going?
Listen Elaine  it seems to me that there isnt a bar in here. I mean  as far as I know.
Benjamin 
Whats the matter?
Dont cry. 
Where are you meeting this person?
Yes.
I dont understand 
Benjamin when you came up here what did you think was going to happen between us?
What are you looking for?
What are you going to do now?
Are you going home?
You wont?
Is that so? You might marry me?
Elaine  are you serious about this?
Or this afternoon. Its a good day for it.
Why dont you just drag me off if you want to marry me so much?
How did he do it? Did he get down on his knees? He didnt get down on his knees I hope.
Oh no. He said that.
Benjamin?
Well  you see  the doctor is at his sons wedding but Im sure its over by now. He should be checking in any moment 
Ben.
Ben  I just want to say one word to you  just one word 
You a student?
Look  Ill give you ten dollars for a dime  Ill give you twenty  for Gods sake will you let me use that phone?
Give me an hour.
What do you drink? Bourbon?
What do you think of me?
No.
I mean  you didnt really think that I would do something like that.
For Gods sake Mrs. Robinson here we are youve got me into your house. You give me a drink. You put on music now you start opening up your personal life to me and tell me your husband wont be home for hours.
Please forgive me. Because I like you. I dont think of you that way. But Im mixed up.
Her portrait?
No.
If you still think Im trying to seduce you 
But they would Dont you see?
Yes I do.
May I sit down?
You dont have to be so nervous you know.
Did you get us a room?
Have you gotten us a room yet?
Why dont you get it.
Well  goodbye then 
Well.
It is isnt it? It is your first time.
You can admit that cant you?
Now  do you think we could say a few words to each other first this time?
Good. I mean are we dead or something?
Im not. No. But do you think we could liven it up with a few words now and then?
Anything. Anything at all.
Art. Thats a good subject. You start it off.
Then I fixed supper for my husband and waited until 
How do you get out of the house?
Were talking.
Right.
Why did you do that?
Because Im interested Mrs. Robinson. Now what was your major subject at college?
But I thought you  I guess you kind of lost interest in it over the years then.
Well how did it happen?
Really. I want to know.
No.
Well  I guess Ill have to ask her out on a date and find out whats 
Do you understand that?
What are you doing?
But its not.
Oh no.  Look  I like you. I wouldnt keep coming here if I didnt like you.
Now listen  this was not my idea. It was my fathers idea.
You cant stop me from seeing her Mrs. Robinson. Ill find her.
The toothbrush. I got it all right.
Well Im going to ask you what you do when you go off at night.
But I want you to. Please. Please will you believe me.
Its pretty embarrassing. I really dont know what to tell Mr. Robinson. Its awkward and strained for me every time he suggests that you call up Elaine.
Im going up to Berkeley today.
Well  when did you decide all this?
Well 
Come on lets call the Robinsons. Weve got something to celebrate.
Thank you very much sir.
Thank you.
Sir?
I know.
How long have you and I known each other? How long have your Dad and I been partners?
Ive watched you grow up Ben.
Oh say  Elaine gets down from Berkeley on Saturday.
Do you have a special grudge against me? Do you feel a particularly strong resentment for me?
Is there something Ive said thats caused this contempt? Or is it just the things I stand for that you despise?
You miss the point.
Can you see me now?
I cant hold them much longer Ben. You better get out here.
Whats happening?
I dont believe it.
Its a short life and a gay one...
And what are you going to do?
Now listen to me. The others are getting suspicious of you. I was on the telephone to Amsterdam today they think youre scared.
Poor girl  chloroform would give her a rotten headache... I know  I had it in the war. Besides shes very pretty  not young but 
Get out and leave it to me... be ready to leave on the night train for Amsterdam...
Like dancing?
Oh
Reducing?
Yes  yes indeed  but you are a...  ...a stenographer. Dont little stenographers earn little pennies?
Shall we say five oclock  downstairs?
Id given you up.
Chasing around.
Yes  Id love to.
Youre not a bit like you were yesterday.
Oh  theres no real thing  it doesnt exist.

Anyone asked for me?
Oh  but  I 
Life is changing you Mr. Kringelein.

Im engaged for the evening.
Dance then? 
Really?
Please  please
Yes of course  money
Of course I do  I never knew what money really meant till I started spending it. Do you know   I can hardly believe that anything so beautiful should come to me from Preysing  Ill take care of you. Will  will you let me?
No.
Oh  too bad. Did you quarrel? 
I must go to England  at once.
Insolent young cub
Oh no.
Oh  ho  you want legal aid against us?  The whole thing seems to me to be very simple.
What?
I mean with the Manchester people?
No water  What a place
I know you did  I said you did 
Evil days  Ive shown you here    my company exports to the Balkans alone sixtyfive thousand marks worth of mop rags a year.
Sorry Preysing. 
Goodbye Preysing I hope you pull through. This is a very bad time to be in such a crisis. Weve...
If you actually have news from Manchester then...
I thought wed suspended negotiations gentlemen.
See you soon Preysing. Next week well meet and discuss further details.
How clear is Manchester?
Mr. Preysing has too scrupulous a regard for certainties...
Ninethirty Mr. Preysing keeps us waiting.
I cant dance tonight 
Orchids come again Madam  no card  I think perhaps they are from the same young man  he is at the end of the corridor  tall  he walks like a soldier  Madam must have noticed how often he is in the elevator with us. Last night for instance 
Yes Madam. And now Madam will sleep. It is not long till the train.
What is this that you have cancelled your car? Who am I that I should wait like a fool at the door? And here on a whim you cancel your car. Have you forgotten there is a performance? Do you know the time? Or are we all mad? Am I your manager?... Have we a contract? Have we obligations? Am I blind?  ...Or is that the time?
Oh Madam is cancelling the engagement. Madam has chosen a funny time for such a funny joke. Ha ha ha  hurry come on. Tonight  theres a line in front of the theatre since six oclock. The house is jammed to the roof.
Suzette  I told you not to bring the pearls. I will not wear them tonight.
Take them back Suzette.
Yes the police must be called.
Her room  oh  I see Mr. Preysing  I understand Mr. General Director Preysing.
If you will wait one moment sir.
Just one moment sir.
Whats the use of asking Gru  he is at the train  He will be there.
Waiting  Im waiting for news from Manchester.
I know  I know.
I can make no statement about Manchester at this time.
Next week.
What the fuck are you doin with a son?

Bobo wants you to go on to Delmar.

This is some of the finest filigreed platinum Ive ever seen. But the stones no. Theyre not diamonds Mrs. Langtry.
Youll give us an opportunity to serve you again I hope. If theres anything you think we might be interested in...
What? Me?
See you in a week Roy. I can call you Roy?
And Im Perk. Short for Percy Im afraid.
Oh come on Roy.
I like those.
Sure.
Why?
Roy I dont want money from you.
Looks very solid Lilly. Sit down. Take a minute tell me about it.
Why should they? The cops are satisfied.
I wouldnt go in on a deal with her. She blamed you for it.
I sat in there with her I thought what do I do now? Run and Ive got Bobo and the law after me. Stay and how do I explain?
It is isnt it? And maybe its a break for me after all. Ive been wanting out of the racket for years and now Im out. I can make a clean start and 
Im sorry. I hated to take your money but 
I need this Roy. I cant run without money and if I cant run Im dead.
Her credit cards. How far am I gonna get with that?
Oh really? Youve got a legitimate complaint Roy I dont deny that. I wasnt a very good mother when you were a kid.
For Gods sake Lilly
Thats good. You dont really belong on this side of the fence you know.
Joe could we talk it over? Do you want a drink?
That isnt granite. If that fell on me it wouldnt hurt at all.
Ow Hey what are you trying to do throw me off my game?
Great to get away take it easy. Next week Ill get back to work.
Nobody does that singleo.
He didnt think they were risks. He was so good Roy he could just play with the mark.

Running your broker scam you mean.
Wait a minute When did this happen that were partners?

What I say is no. We dont do partners.
Roy Dillon?
I realize this is a shock.
Sure. Lets get it over.
Well thank you. And thank them.
One set of muddy shoe prints.
Where judging by the looks of the finger and palm prints she struggles to open the window before banging on it like hell.
The killer knocks the knife out of her hand with the wroughtiron poker.
Carter.
Mind if we sit down?
Funny we just drove right in.
Do you know who did this?
Besides its historically inaccurate.
Michael Meyers never used a meat cleaver.  It was a butcher knife.
Hey Mis Whittington whats up?
Nothing to fear.  The coast is clear.
Totally.  I checked all the rooms and closets...
What the 
Oh so now its my fault?
Im sorry alright?  It was just a stupid joke.
What?  Where is she?
What are you doing here?
Better?
Molly of all the people... if I cant trust my resident assistant then what?
Linda  He killed Linda
Hey you alright?
Not a real fan of Halloween humor Will.
Im gonna head back to the office... finish up some things.
Ooooh busted.
Youre so easy...
He do that to you?
What are you doing there?  Wheres my mother?
Seventhirty is the costume pageant ... Carving jackolanterns at eight ... Photos for the school paper at nine ... Then Harry lights the tree at nine thirty ... I just know Im forgetting something
Shh.  Mommys here.  What is it?

Come on sweetheart  what is this? Whos coming?
So theyre trying to kill you and your baby. Dont tell me.  Your name also happens to be Rosemary.
She wasnt here when I brought Danny home from 
Do you know how insane this is?  Who am I supposed to be looking for?
Kyles mother might be dead for all I know. Now Im afraid he could be next.
It was there when I found him this morning.  It looks like some kind of letter or number or 
Halloween.
Danny  Danny where are you?
Christ what a night  Not even so much as a sign for five miles on that road
We need you Dr. Loomis.
It was her voice.  On the radio.  It was Jamie.  Calling for me.
Your madness is another mans greatness.  This is the way things have always been.  Youve just been too blinded by your own reality to see.  But having you on the outside has been convenient for us in many ways.  You always did come through  our loyal watch dog. Finding him. Bringing him back to us once hed finished his work.  Although after you had that nasty stroke the last time I had to go after him myself.  And what a terrible time we had getting him out of that jail cell.
Yes?
No  there had to be someone else. Who knew?
A bitch.
It appears that were going to have to wait awhile for any more action here Colonel.  Why dont you run on home while the evenings young.
No.
I wish youd tell Alice that.  And that Goddamn Mrs. Wheeler.
Otherwise how are things?
Fourteen times you told me.  I counted.
Youd get this funny look in your eyes and Id say to myself Oh Jesushes going to tell me what a retiarius is again.
Go to the funeral?
All the more reason to go to Africa.
I dont think so.  It could have been.
Whos going to fly our helicopter now?
Gee whiz
I wouldnt drop my gun.
Im smarter than Looseleaf.
No matter what you say to me I still think youre the greatest guy I ever knew.
Oh hell.
Behind a desk for a little while.  A desk  They had him planning air raids.  A city cant flee like a coward or fight like a man and the choice between fleeing and fighting was at the core of the life of Harold Ryan.  There was only one thing he enjoyed more than watching someone make that choice and that was making the choice himself.  Ask about Spain where he was the youngest soldier in the Abraham Lincoln Brigade.  He was a famous sniper.  They called him La Picadurathe sting.
Ask about the time he and I were parachuted into Yugoslavia to join a guerrilla bandin the war against the Nazis.
Youre supposed to get hurt
He seems to think they are.  He told me that were.
Yes wife it is.  Come here boy.  Your father is home.
Alive and hale.  Hes throwing a little surprise party for his own family.  Is your mother often this unstable?  Penelope
Tomorrows Saturday.  Anyway shes dead.
Dads got jungle fever Mom. Whatll I do?  Mom
Play?
Whats this?
Can I help you sir?
Eighteen  and a half.
Sir?
Im sorry sir Im engaged to be married.  My boyfriend would be mad if I went out with another man.
Im engaged.
This is crazy.
Whats the matter?
What sort of time period do you have in mind?  Half an hour?  An hour?
This reunion isnt what I imagined it would be.
Bluh.
Your old beau?
He hasnt had breakfast yet.
Im going to touch your shoulders very gently now.  You mustnt scream.  So tense so tense.
Youre thinking with your brain instead of your body.  Thats why youre so tense  Forget Norbert. Relax.  Its body time.
Shes up in Heaven now.  She didnt hear.  She is experiencing nothing but pure happiness.  Theres nothing nicer than that.  Chow  Harold Ryan wants chow
Thats what youre supposed to say.
It couldnt
Fish cant feel.
Such as?...
And he keeps it in his apartment?
He did his best to destroy my most precious possession which is the high opinion women have of me.  Im now going to even that score.  Im going to break in his door and Im going to smash his violin.
I came for Paul as well.
Did you like it dear?
He had hoped that someone would be playing it stilltwo hundred years from now.
And you a supposedly healthy woman do not detest him for his cowardice?
An Indian narcotic we were forced to drink.  It put us in a hazea honeycolored haze which was lavender around the edge.  We laughed we sang we snoozed.  When a bird called we answered back. Every living thing was our brother or our sister we thought. Looseleaf stepped on a cockroach six inches long and we cried.  We had a funeral that went on for five daysfor the cockroach  I sang Oh Promise Me. Can you imagine? Where the hell did I ever learn the words to Oh Promise Me?  Looseleaf delivered a lecture on maintenance procedures for the hydraulic system of a B36.  All the time we were drinking more blue soup more blue soup  Never stopped drinking blue soup.  Blue soup all the time. Wed go out after food in that honeycolored haze and everything that was edible had a penumbra of lavender.
Beautiful you say?  It wasnt life it wasnt deathit wasnt anything  Beautiful?  Seven years gone  like that like that  Seven years of silliness and random dreams Seven years of nothingness when there could have been so much
I mean it
Help your mother find the bullet.
Hello?  Ohhello Mother.
...Who?... Did she say how far apart the pains were?... When was that?... Oh dear.
Will you please go?  An emergency
Yes  Yes  The boy  One boy
Safe and sound I see.  Ohyou came back.
None.
Congratulations.  By crossing twentyeight feet of cockroach infested carpet youve become the third white man ever to hear of it.
This is man to man.
Youre oldso old.
Youre a son of a bitch.
Hands and knees you say?
You hope.
You can never take yourself seriously again  Look at all the creatures youve protected us from Did you shoot them on the elevator as they were on their way up here to eat us alive?
Something seems to have happened to my selfrespect.
Was I ever of use?
Like the sabertoothed tiger.
Cant do it.
Thank youfor my life.
Dead
What happened?
How horrible.
Wont you please join our club? Please?
Is it?  I have this theory about why men kill each other and break things.
Shes my date tonight.  What do you want her to dobring the poor old jaguars back to life with a bicycle pump?  Bugger off  Ask Paul what he thinks.  Your mother looks beautifulright?  Kid?  Doesnt your mother look nice?  Paul?
I had not the slightest inkling.  Why didnt you say so?
No.
I know.
Not even Mutual of Omaha thinks so anymore.
Thats an interesting piece of news.
Not true.
In a railroad accident many years ago.
I hate that thing.
Is Norbert still here?
Mom?
What are his symptoms?
My father
Dont worry about it.
He isnt?
Yes?
Im touched.
Did you see him?
Is he coming home?
The park
Did you talk to Paul?
What was it?
Thank you Herb.  Youre a wonderful man.  You really are. Everybody respects you for what youve done for scouting and the Little League.
You were wonderful.
Oh no  Wear a coat of cottonwear a coat of wool.
This is very good for us.
Every night Penelope for the past two years Ive made it a point to walk through the park at midnight.
He can make the sound of human footstepswhich is a terrifying sound.
You fool you fool.
Everythings going to be beautiful.
Is that a fact?
Albert Einstein plays shuffleboard.
Lewis Carroll who wrote Alice in Wonderland plays shuffleboard.
We arent gonna arrest him for that...
Okay. Ill take a half hour.
No Felice Im not a cop. In fact right now Ive got as little respect for the police as you do.  Im looking for a girl. A runaway. I need someone to help me.
What do you mean?
Just one.
Yeah. Hes a nice guy. Dont lose him. Maybe we could tone down this stripe a bit. Its a little...
Are you sure its all right?
I work with Ramada. Were doing some pictures together.
Are you Niki?
Do I know you? Werent you on the set the other night? With Ramada.
Here? What a joke. There was some detective asking about that girl.
Make it nine hundred. That was my best week.
You have anything to drink? You want to go out and get something?
And your wife? Wheres she?
You really shouldnt eat like that. All that sugar. Its not good for you.
You know what Im talking about.
Say what?
No.
Out of gratitude for being chosen. Thats where Grace comes in. God first chooses you then allows you by Grace to choose Him of your own free will.
Its not quite the same thing.
Todll meet you at the bookstore at Eddy and OFarrell tomorrow noon. I told him you were a specialty customer.
Grand Rapids? Of course.
Why do you say that?
Those cops like all cops are intelligent enough but they are masters of deductive reason. That is you ask them what three and two are theyll tell you five but if you ask them what five is they go blank. Thats speculative reasoning and thats where I come in.
Dogshit. Worse yet they dont care.
Andy.
I dont know.
Where is she?
Yeah. Probably.
I aint cheated you Pilgrim. This is research damn it That girl could have told us something.
Im only human you know.
Do the police want to arrest me?
You know its possible to buy anything on this earth. You can buy child whores slaves. You can have people raped killed...  One of the men who supposedly arranges such things is named Ratan. He usually isnt in this country.  Howd you hear about him?
Andy can you do something for her? Maybe money...
Wes do me a favor.
What is that? A kind of chair? I never heard of no Ratan.
Who the fuck knows? The Four Aces. He goes there.
Fifty cents admission.
Im just trying to find...  Who owns this store?
No. I walked up. Dont ride elevators.
Yes.  Im interested in financing an adult feature film. I was told you were the man to come to.
Ive got fifty thousand dollars to invest.
Not exactly...
I thought you were a businessman.
I got a picture here. I want you to tell me where to find this woman. I been asking everybody. Nobody knows anything.
I dont suppose youve ever seen this girl before either? Her names Kristen but I suppose youve never seen her?
Whats that?
You can fuck off too.
I want you to take a look at this girl here. Shes been in some porn stuff.
Im still in L.A. but Im looking for Tod. I heard he was around.
He seems very nice. Is Harold interested in eh whats going on? I think its such a super thing to study. And then of course I can always fall back on home ec.
Could I see your registration?
But there is a family resemblance.
What do you see?
Oh of course. What is your name?
Can I drop you anywhere Harold?
Do you sing and dance?
Yearse
Its all memorabilia but incidental and not integral if you know what I mean.
Harold?
How about some ginger pie?
A selfportrait.  But over here is my favorite. Its titled Rainbow with Egg Underneath and an Elephant. Do you like it?
It goes on and on.
What do you think?
Here we are Harold. Oat straw tea and ginger pie.
You dont look eighty.
Boy Maude. The way you handle cars. Id never handle a car like that.
What is it?
Oh my. Were too late.
No.
Oh those motorcycles are awfully chilly.
I uthinku I see it.
Well I really dont smoke.
Did Confucius say that?
Yes. I havent lived.  Ive died a few times.
Died Seventeen times  not counting maiming.  Shot myself in the face once with a popgun and a pellet of blood.
Look at that sky.  Its so big.
Want to join me in some cartwheels?
But theyll put me in jail.
Dont you talk to me like that you little foul mouth degenerate  Really sir I thought that you at least...
Oh you werent scared.
How about some candy floss?
Look at the stars.
I was remembering how much this meant to me. It was after the war... I had nothing... except my life. How different I was then  and yet how the same.
Farewell?
But youre not going anywhere are you?
Please dont you realize? She is dying.
Oh... Thats wonderful... I get an eightyyearold pallbearer for a daughterinlaw Be reasonable Harold Youre dealing with your life What will people say?
How do you do?
Tell me Harold how many of these eh suicides have you performed?
I dont think Im getting through to Mother like I used to.
I put a lot of effort into these things.
And a lot of time.
No.
I see. Junkyards. What is the fascination there?
Thats very interesting Harold and I think very illuminative. There seems to be a definite pattern emerging.  Your fondness for useless machines and demolitions seems indicative of your present emotional state your selfdestructive urges and your alienation from the regular social interaction. What do you think? And of course this pattern once isolated can be coped with. Recognize the problem and you are half way on the road to its solution. But tell me what do you do for ufunu? What activity gives you a different sense of enjoyment than the others? What do you find fulfilling? What gives you that certain satisfaction?
Your classmates?
Your studies?
I see. Tell me Harold do you remember your father at all?
Is that a fact? Well that fits in right along with everything Ive been saying. War is not all black.
Its the greatest excitement in the world.
How about to slit his throat?
Stay where you are Harold .
Good afternoon Officer. Bit of trouble here?
He... he loved me.
Well the sofa isnt often used for sleeping on...
You DIDNT tell me. Do you mean Malahides got...
Get out of the way.
I dont know Kyle. Youre the fucking expert. Now get out of the way
O.K. Lets go.
But its true he is his own Hell. Just as you are in yours.
Nonsense I...
He talked about Demons huh?
Look at them ugly suckers Blue. One sheet of glass between them and us.
I break it they see us Happy Halloween. No more hiding.  Outside. I could be outside 
Hey. Stinky. Kitchens closed.  Whatcha havin? Six library guards raw? Plus belts and boots? Man youre gonna need some heavy fiber to move that out 
Red. How long was it latched onto you?
This is an important mission Sgt. Whitman. I hope you realize that.
Sgt. Whitman Sgt. Whitman May I have a word??
Youre wasting our time Theres nothing on this island but sheep and rocks.
If hes here this is worse than I thought.
Cordon off the area. Something came through.
Cmon  Rasputin??
These freaks Trevor they give me the creeps. And Im not the only one. Youre up for review. You and your petting zoo.
Son. About Rasputin 
In absentia luci tenebrae vinciunt...
Im in way over my head I know that much.
Got tired of me?
Sir may I go first??
You will never fulfill your destiny. You will never understand the power inside you.
 should go back. Now
Helping you  I just 
Myers?
Hey your chilis getting cold 
Um... Liz  I  theres something Id like you to  something I need you to hear.
Listen. Im not like Myers. He makes you feel like you belong. And  thats good. It really is. I  wish I could do something about this   But I cant.  I can promise you only two things... One Ill always look this good. Two I wont give up on you. Ever.
Its freezing isnt it?
That you feel that way about me.
Hit me.
Yes I 
Christ
Its my lucky day.
Whats happening?
The box... you opened it. We came.
Many times.
Just in time.
Please. Get back into bed.
Well the police are going to want to speak to you. You know that.
Julia
You bastard 
Bastard.
Well can I come in or not?
What about Larry 
Back from where?
You cant let me stay like this. Please. You cant.
My nerves... are beginning to work again.
 to heal me completely. Then we can be away from here before they come looking.
Later.
To experience beyond anything ever known. At least thats what I was promised when I bought it. Pleasure from Heaven or Hell. I didnt much care which.
So wheres the harm?
Maybe we should just leave 
Whats the problem?
How long since you were here?
You know we have to let Kirsty see this place before we do anything to it. Shell love it.
Youre still blaming me.
All right.
No argument.
Well?
What have you done?
Youre NOT going to faint.
Take it slowly.
Youre done worse.
Ill be O.K. Just leave me be a while.
Is this upsetting you?
Are you all right?
Oh baby.
Well isnt it?
Is this your place ?
No personal details?
This isnt the bedroom.
I suppose not.
Oh Christ.
Well if you change your mind. Whats this friends name?
What did you say?
Well I want you to see the house.
Maybe later in the week. First Ive got to find myself a job.
What are you drinking love?
I guess.
Would you... maybe call round sometime? Try to make friends.
Get the fuck out of here.
All right.  No. Thats nice.
Meaning what?
Oh no?
Really?  Married Kevin?  Her junior high sweetheart... What chance would I have had against that?  None no chance.  Thats just fate.
Play it.
How can it be bullshit to state a preference?
Nice Barry.
Not the point.
Barry Im fucking broke  I know we used to fuck with anyone who asked for anything we didnt like but its gotta stop.
I wanna date a musician...
Were only on the fucking list for Maries gig at the Pulaski Pub thats all  All three of us.

I never thought I would say this but can I go work now?
Shut the fuck up Barry.
Dont be sad Barry.  Youll find true love someday.
Thanks for your support Rob.  Really appreciate it.
I didnt make up the name.  Its the Steely Dan song.  And it was in The Commitments.
Fuck off Barry.
Because its in The Big Chill.
What is she doing?  Okay 20.
You couldnt be.  Look Barry. Theres going to be people from Lauras work there people who own dogs and babies and Tina Turner albums.  How are you going to cope with them?
Im looking for a record for my daughter.  For her birthday.  I Just Called To Say I Love You. Do you have it?
Its almost impossible to find especially on CD.  Yet another cruel trick on all of the dumbasses who got rid of their turntables.  But every other Echo and the Bunnymen album 
What?
No not nothing.  Whats wrong with the Righteous Brothers?
She shouldnt done it on The Number Four With a Smile.
Thats what I said.
A couple blocks  About six
Anna Moss.
What are you talking about?
Sure but is that it for the list?
Who?  Oh.  My friend.  My friend is Laura.  A girl.  A friend whos a girl.
And the new label?  And the Kinky Wizards?
Morning Dick.
Yeah I havent really absorbed that one.
Whats this?
Are you all right?
Ive ah... got some other stuff to tell him anyway so its no problem. Ill just tell him about you know Laura when I tell him the other stuff.
Rob.
Rob 
Mmmm no.  Not a good idea.
What needs sorting out?
So you werent interested in music at all?
But Laura... thats me.  Thats all there is to me.  There isnt anything else.  If youve lost interest in that youve lost interest in everything.
Im sorry.  I havent been very fair to you.  Thats why I came here to the store this evening.  I feel terrible Rob.  This is really hard you know.
Look.  Maybe youll grow up and well get it together you and me.  Maybe Ill never see either of you again. I dont know.  All I know is that its not a good time to be living here.
I suppose so.
No problem.  If I can ask one question.
You wont like it.
The sleeping together is better but not the sex because you havent done it was him yet.
So how are you?
Will you call me?
I figured it was.  Where are you?
Hes at home.  Listen I cant believe he went to the store.  Im mortified actually.  Im really sorry.  He had no right to do that and I told him so.
I dont really want to talk about it to be honest.
Hello.
Guess who I just saw right by my store?  Ian.  In Starbucks.  Neat huh?
Youre soaking.
What do you mean?
Sure I understand.  Look I dont want to take up any more of your time.  You get back and Ill wait here for a bus.
What?
Ive only got a couple left.  Im saving them for later.
So if you had a bit more energy wed stay split.  But things being how they are what with you wiped out youd like us to get back together.
Mission accomplished.
Oh cmon Laura.  Just say something. Lie if you want.  Itd stop me asking you questions and itd make me feel better.
... Like Mexico.  Or Jamaica.  Or New York even.
Where?
I had that idea when I was living with Ian and it was such a good idea that I was annoyed we werent together anymore.  It might even be why I came back.
Theyll go on early.  Nobody will even be there yet and I told them they cant play for more than a half hour.
Are you worried about tomorrow night?
Ha ha ha.  Hoo hoo hoo.
I know.
Im sorry.  But two days ago you were in love with that girl who interviewed you for The Reader werent you?
No.  Probably not.
So?
About what?
Im an idiot.  I should have played the record first.  This place is about to get burned down.
Rob here.
Whats happenin.
So the minister says nice things and then what we all troop outside and they bury him?
Youre kidding.  A crematorium? Jesus.
She just wanted to pick up some stuff. No big thing.  A relief actually.
What do you mean the Crumblers? You know the Crumblers?  Nobodys heard the Crumblers.  Except me.
So youll stay?
Would you like me to turn the lights out?  Or would you like them on?
How would I know?  Gone.  Girlfriend. Leave.  Not say where gone.  Laura move out.
I knew this would happen.  What are you going to do Rob?
I knew this was going to happen.
What did Laura say?  Do you know why she left?
So you say.  Id like to hear her side of it.
What do you think?
Thats why Im trying to compromise. What about fifteenhundred?  Theyre worth five times that.
We saw this ad in the personals for two swingers lookin for a Renaissance fair.
Probably just some exec ducking an exwife.
Taupin isnt that the guy Moran picked up the other night?
No.
Poor little tyke didnt have a chance.  Hopelessly premature.  He died a few days after he was born.
Okay okay.
Jesus Christ.
I left a man dead in Felton.  But you dont really care do you?
Id rather hear yours.
Whats all that?
You make it all sound so simple.
I dont know any of these.  Ill make a fool of myself.
Then you must be at least 70 years old.
Its frightening sometimes the way you talk about other peoples lives.
Ive been telling myself its the award winning journal article Im going to write.  But its not.  Its you.
Who are you?
He is older than I.
Not the same.
What is it like?  Being you?
The emptyness.  The years and years of void.  Nothingness.  Bordered only by the quest for ultimate nothingness. Who would have guessed?
Forget it.
Arent you getting a little old for this?  You flunked out of law school.
A murder.
I have witnesses that can put the two of you together.
Someone should check him out. Maybe a collection somewhere got knocked over.  He has one he might have two.
Requiem acernam donaei
Stop.
Aye.
Your marks would suggest great injury.
Do you ever feel a flow as if some thing were pushing against you?
Conor you and I we cannot be killed.
Listen to me.  Hear the words.
It is the truth.
You are not dead boy.  Accept it.
Theres rumor in the village. Some call it magic.
Thats wonderful.  Where did you ever learn it?
Not so scared.
Finish your prayers?
I understand you joined up in Bremen.
Equals?
You see Major?  You are not so different...
I want people in here to check over every piece of this stuff.
Round up who you can and put them on standby.
Smith.  Carl Smith.
Answer me.
Spare a chair?
Are you going to offer me a chair or leave me standing here all night?
How are you?
Old habits die hard.  Waitress  A round of Nitzhic  Peasant drool I know.  But its the closest thing they stock to my side of the fence.
And have you something to settle with me?
Tasting and enjoying life is the only thing of value we have.  All else is just marking time.  Youre marking time.
The pressure only comes when you let the taste slip into your mouth.
We have some unfinished business.
Yes laddie I have her.
This your present address?
Did you know the victim?
What were you looking for?
Do you know what this is?
A claymore to be exact.  You wouldnt know anything about it would you?
Home.
The resemblance is amazing.
Cant you say hello to a fellow?
Who is it?
Aint you got any more sense than to  ?  Oh hhello Mr. Burns. Why quite an honor having you come over here.
Remember the ending?    and all is well outside his cell But in his heart he hears the hangman Calling and the gallows falling And his whitehaired mothers tears...
But I dont gamble Hilda
All right.  One  two  three  four  five. Five hundred. Be careful honey.
Hildy Johnson... Oh hello Bruce. Have you got it? Is it certified?
Did you finish the interview?
Hildy
Did you give her the money?
Then suppose you give me the money. Four hundred and fifty dollars.
But I see she didnt mean old in years. You always carry an umbrella Bruce?
Where are we going? Im going to buy you two lunch  didnt Hildy tell you?
Anything the matter?
Im beginning to realize that.
Who do you think you are breaking in here like this?
What about this Burns? Kidnapping eh?
Call Duffy
Youre going to be in office for exactly two days more and then were pulling your nose out of the feed bag.
What do you want?
No  Mama doesnt dream about you any more Walter. You wouldnt know the old girl now.
Lets not fight Hildy. Tell you what. You come back to work on the paper and if we find we cant get along in a friendly way well get married again.
Sure you can. Come on.
What were you when you came here five years ago? A little college girl from a School of Journalism I took a little dollfaced mugg 
I made a great reporter out of you Hildy but you wont be half as good on any other paper and you know it. You need me and I need you  and the paper needs both of us.
The quicker the better. Well  I finally got out what I came in to tell you.  So long Walter and better luck next time.
Then what does he want with you?
And he takes his hat off when hes with a lady.
And when he walks with a lady he waits for her
You said it.
No Bruce dear. Dont you see? This is a trick to get your sympathy. No Walter Ive been waiting for something like this  but I wasnt sure when youd spring it. If you want to save Earl Williams life you can interview him yourself. Youre still a good reporter. Bruce and I will be on that four oclock train  and thanks just the same.
Now youre talking
What tricks would I pull?
It better be fifteen minutes because Bruce is waiting downstairs in a taxicab and that meters clicking away to beat the band.
Walter Ddid you see    that?
Attagirl Why theyll be naming streets after you  Hildy Johnson Street Therell be statues of you in the parks Hildy. The radioll be after you  the movies  By tomorrow morning Ill betcha theres a Hildy Johnson cigar I can see the billboards now. Light up with Hildy Johnson
Not if hes inside the desk. Well carry the desk over.  Give me Duffy
How about the time he had his house painted by the Fire Department?
Railroad tickets.
Its Fate Hildy. What will be will be.
If it was my own mother Id carry on You know I would. For the paper
Who?  Hello Butch Where are you?
Oh for   H. Sebastian  Butch Listen its a matter of life and death Listen
Oh I see. I beg your pardon.
Hildy you just cant leave me out on a limb now. It  it wouldnt be cricket
Yeah. What about the time we hid the missing heiress in the sauerkraut factory? Six scoop interviews
Sorry Hildy. I didnt mean to be making love to another mans fiancee.
Bruce is making the nine oclock train. I told him youd be on it  unless you want to write this story yourself.
Then why are you doing it?
Whered you wire him?
Hildy if thats what you want all right. Well even go to  how about Niagara Falls?
Thats what he said the last time. Dont believe him Judge.
But Hildy  I can explain 
Oh dear Oh dear
Now everythings fine. Shes probably squawking her head off in some police station.
You know me. The shirt off my back.
Heres that certified check Walter.  I drew out my wifes savings and if this isnt back by 530 Im a ruined man
Hello Hildy What are you doing around here?
Say isnt this your twenty dollars?
The newspapers Sheriff theyre the scum of modern civilization.
I dont know 
You know you are to be executed Mr. Williams. Who do you feel is responsible for that?
Now the Sheriff will be Mollie Malloy in whose room you were. You will be Earl Williams. And I will be the policeman. Follow me Mr. Williams?
Better let us in on it Mollie.
That must be the tenth alienist theyve had on Williams. Even if he wasnt crazy before he would be after ten of those babies got through psychoanalyzing him.  Gimme the desk.
Hold the phone
We know what youre up to.
All right then Ill just run the story that Sheriff Hartman is afraid to let reporters interview his prisoner. Of course with election coming that might do you a lot of harm but just as you say.
If the Mayor wants me he knows where I am.
What went off?
I wish you wouldnt talk like that Pete.
Shoot to kill I said.
And so do I
Fine thanks Sheriff.
I hope youre pretty nearly through with me Doctor Im getting a little fatigued.
Any news?
I dont know why you boys are so good to me.
Hello Hildy. I thought you were gone.
Look out you 
Have you got my dough?
Here
Any dope yet on how he got out?
Hiding him where?
Mother
Sure. You see Id never had a gun in my hand before and I didnt know what to do with it. Well when I get stuck I know that theres an answer for everything in production for use. So it came to me in a flash whats a gun for? To shoot So I shot. Simple isnt it?
Earl theres just one thing I ought to clear up for the interview.
Earl you must never do that again.
Stop screaming Mollie or were sunk. Im trying to think of something before those reporters get back.
Come on Mollie. This is no place for you. 
Where are they gone? You know where they are?

Thank you so much. Merci. Its very wonderful to hear a man say such a nice compliment.
What is wrong my darling?
Dr. Bronfmans line. Yes. One moment please.  Lila.
Yeah. Okay. Be home around seven. Bye.  What? Im sorry. What was I supposed to do?
Gabby what is it?
What is it?
You were wonderful today darling. Such authority with the apeman boy. It made me so hot for you.
Lila?
A penny for your thoughts mon cheri.
Nice night.
No. Go back to the woods. This is a sacrifice I need to make. In my world we have something called penance. Its another abstraction but I had the concept drummed into my head during my years in the convent. It doesnt exist for you and it shouldnt. See I could never be free again anyway so I might as well be in jail.
Thats what Im counting on.
Oh yes honey. Getting to be smooth smooth smooth all over. Smooth as a babys butt.
Somehow it came up that you were a friend of mine. Mr. handsome animal loving psychologist said he would love to meet you.
Oh?
Be still my crotch.
And Im going to miss the lifestyle having you as a client has afforded me.
I like you so much with or without hair.  But dont spread that around. Bad for business.
Meditations on a Banana Slug was a delightful read.
Yes. I suppose not. But still. One would like to move along. To move beyond.
Quite well really. Its a lot of work. A lot of reinforcement mostly positive. Right now Ive gotten two of my subjects to use napkins. Tiny napkins of course.
The truth is most people dont have table manners today. And when the foundations of civilized society crumble and disappear civilized society in its entirely follows closely at its heels.
No Im sorry. Im really backward in certain areas.
Its just that I have some peculiarities and...
I dont know. Something.
Youll catch cold. Its cold.  What do you suppose he is a survivalist?
Forget mice Actually forget guinea pigs cats monkeys and chimps also. Im on to stage five The human subject.
What are you doing in there?
Who is it?
So hows it going today?
Because Im really trying you know. Rosie says maybe only another two years of the elctrolysis.
Oh baby. Im sorry. Cant you hire somebody else?
Who needs it? I have you and I have being a woman and I have thinking about womanly things I love being a woman because...
Such as my man and how to please him  Such as making wonderful dinners for my man  Such as looking pretty for my man  And Im writing an article on quilting for the Ladies Home Journal
So hes doing okay?
And what did you do tonight honey?
Do you know what I gave up to be with you?
I gave up my soul my beliefs. I gave up my body hair
Shut up  I gave you... life. I created you in my image Puff. I took you from this primordial ooze and brought you into the world of culture and art and manners. And this is how you repay me? By heading back to the ooze first chance you get? I should leave you here with Lila the ape woman. It would serve you right you ungrateful piece of crap. But Im not going to. Youre too valuable to me. Totally selfish of me. You serve my purpose. But if you had any smarts you would realize that I serve your purpose as well. Life is so much more delightful when lived in a silk suit.
Goodeveninglaydeesandgent elmen.
This is great Puff. Youre doing fine.
I dont think this aversion therapy is really necessary doctor. I understand the problem.
Extra dessert?
Thanks to you Nate.
And of course to you my sweet for your... moral support.
I love Lila. I mean shes a wonderful person. And... she loves me Thats no small potatoes. I mean she really loves me. Shes sacrificed so much to be in this relationship with me. And shes a good person. A truly good person. How rare is that in this world eh? And how could I stop loving somebody because of a little physical imperfection if it can even be called that. I mean God knows Im not perfect What about my eyesight? Its lousy thats what Lilas not going to leave me because of my eyesight. What about my penis?
Comin in or goin out?
Put it on the bed. Thats the way its done isnt it?
Im sure Mr. Felson knows what hes doing. Certainly you can afford a hundred dollars to find out.
Do you really think you can beat him?
Only when I work.
Pool.
He drank as much whisky as you did.
Thats your problem.
No three thousand at least. Hell start you off at five hundred a game  hell beat the pants off you. Thats the way he plays when he comes up against a man who knows the way the game is. Hell beat you flat four or five games  maybe more depending on how uh... steady your nerves are. But he might  he just might be a little scared of you and that could change things. But I wouldnt count on it.
Eddie is it all right if I get personal?
Get the three thousand. Play Minnesota Fats again.
Ten reasons. Maybe fifteen. And also theres something in it for me.
For me.
Words out on you Eddie. You walk in the wrong kind of place and theyll eat you alive.
Ahh slow... Why the open hand bridge? Something wrong with your hand?
What happened? Somebody step on your hands?
The first match I got in mind for you is in Louisville Kentucky.

Ah get with it will ya Charlie?
Is this all we got left?
Oh yeah? Howd you find me?
Oh I dont want to be no bother to nobody.
What kind of life have you got here? Scufflin around the small rooms picking up eight ten bucks a day?
Ill bet you do Mr. Felson. Ill just bet you do.
Whos he?
Gimme ten bucks.
You quittin too?
You better not miss friend.
How long have you been waiting?
Just a cup of black coffee please...  Hey maam Wait a minute  Would you uh like another cup?
You dont look like a college girl.
So why go to college?
I dont know. Whatever you like it to be.
Why did you do that?
Why?
You know Ive been living here for almost three years. Now in three days it seems as if I know everybody. When I pass people on the street I want to stop and say Listen I got a fella.
Well I believe you when you say you go to school.

An old mans dream.
Weve hit a snag. Our project leader has vanished. Along with all his research. Uh we received a cable from his colleague Doctor Schneider who has no idea of his whereabouts or whats become of him.  I want you to pick up the trail where he left off. Find the man and you will find the Grail.

What does that mean?
I didnt know you could fly a plane.
Dad are we hit?
Those people are trying to kill us

Mikes our Attorney General down here.  I was just explaining to Jeff they got a Kentucky court to issue a gag order to stop his deposition today.
And thats what cigarettes are for...?
The straw that broke the camels back for me and really put me in trouble with Sandefur was a compound called coumarin. When I came on board at BW they had tried to transition from coumarin to a similar flavor that would give the same taste and had been unsuccessful. I wanted it out immediately. I was told that it would affect sales so I should mind my own business. I constructed a memo to Mr. Sandefur indicating I could not in conscience continue with coumarin in a product that we now knew we had documentation was similar to coumadin a lungspecific carcinogen...
Poor communication skills.
Dr. Wigand. I am instructing you...  ...not to answer that question in accordance to the terms of the contractual obligations undertaken by you not to disclose any information about your work at the Brown  Williamson Tobacco Company. And in accordance with the force and effect of the temporary restraining order that has been entered against you to by the court in the State of Kentucky That means you dont talk  Mr. Motley we have rights here...

No. She loved me. She would never not love her son. She just didnt... I wasnt her type. She said I was a very colicky baby. You know? Difficult. Not a good sleeper? Didnt eat well? We got off to a bad start and she never seemed to recoup 
Apparently she was very disappointed.
And here I thought my mother was...
Im sorry Miles. You shouldnt listen to me. Im sure you have a very fulfilling life. Id better go. Im depressing.
I have to say  Im speechless. No. Im never speechless.

Are you familiar with Kirshner?
Mr. Rexroth.
...Well my wife has me between a rock and a hard place.
Not in court you cant. Has she retained counsel?

In anticipation of making you sick.
And she has...?
Wrigley

She owes me a meal.

Now Mrs. Banderas. What is your relationship to Mrs. Rexroth.
Three is not Farrow.

If its on the level.

Hello Joe. Sorry. Just a little gag of mine. Thought Id have some fun with you.
What?
Funny couple aint they?
A trumpet?
Mush. Mush.
There you gotrustin people again. How many times did I tell you
If you wanna get anywhere nowadays you gotta keep in touch with all the news is what I always say.
Lucky thing my running into you. Just the man I need.
What else stupid You dont think were after that pennyante reward do you?  Ten thousand bucks? Chicken feed Were holding her for a million smackers.
Shshsh Soft pedal you mugbefore I Whatre you trying to do? Tell the whole world about it  Now listen youre in this thingand youre staying in Get me? You know too much.
Susie watch the language would you please.
Gentlemen I will not hear this.  I value Bill as much as anyone here.  We all need to make room for someone elses ideas Lou especially me. Maybe Oswald is what everyone says he is and Im just plain dumb wrong.
Why you keep dancing on my head for my man?  We been thickern molasses pie since law school.
There you go.  Grain of salt.  Two sides to every coin.
Yeah she was pretty all right but not half as cute as you Deano.  You shoulda tried a legitimate line of business.
And Oswald?
Of course there werent. Cause they disappeared.  And yet the Commission found you Dean.
All this blubbering over that sonofabitch  Theyre grieving like they knew the man.  It makes me want to puke.
I dont know if its coincidence but Oswald had a top security clearance and knew about the U2 program from his days at Atsugi Air Base in Japan.  Six months after he arrives in Russia Francis Gary Powers U2 spy flight goes down in Russia.  That plane was untouchable. Powers hinted that Oswald couldve given the Russians enough data to hit it.  As a direct result the peace summit between Khrushchev and Eisenhower failed.  I cant help thinking of that book Seven Days In May maybe someone in our military didnt want the Peace Conference to happen maybe Oswald was part of that.  It gets weirder.
Bill.
Its you I want to talk to Bill.
Who do you think fed him that information?  Garrisons going down. Were talking your career here Bill your life.  Youre a young guy... we know youre working that Castro thing.
Its addressed to no one and no signature.  To leave this life is for me a sweet prospect.  I find nothing in it that is desirable and on the other hand everything that is loathsome.
Clay Bertrand?  Sure I know him.  He comes around the Quarter.
Shaw.  Clay Shaw.
Clay Bertrand Willie?
But why?
I still have to question what the legal basis is that supports this boss.  Susies stuff is colorful but...
Nick what would happen if a man suffering from hypertension were to take an entire bottle of Proloid?
...ever called Dean Andrews?
You still questioning any Cubans?
...give me protection?
Come in Dave.  Have a seat make yourself comfortable.  Coffee?
Oh it was just a spur of the moment thing...  the storm wasnt that bad.
Yes now I remember Mr. Garrison. Im sorry I got confused.  We got out there near the geese and it was only then we realized wed forgotten our shotguns.  Stupid right?  So of course we didnt get any geese.
Why?  Whats wrong?
You mean about the Cubans getting trained north of the lake?
Let me get this straight now.  Clay Shaw is blackmailing you?
And Shaw?
What about Ruby?
No.
I cant believe youre saying this in the courtroom.
Dad look what I drew.
Look we can put you in a mental institution.  We can make you look craziern Marguerite Oswald and everybody knows how crazy she is.
If we go to him our investigationll hit the front pages by sunrise. Blow up right in our face.  Ruby was just given a new trial.  If he has something to say itll be there. Susie what did you find out on Oswald?
Finally they shuttle him to a radio factory in Minks where he lives as high on the hog as he ever has  hes given 5000 rubles a roomy apartment with a balcony has affairs with local girls.
This is a man whose secrets cause us to change our radar patterns in the Pacific  He shouldve been prosecuted as a traitor
Spas T. Raikin a leading member of an antiCommunist group.
The next thing we know hes living in DallasFt. Worth in October 62 working 6 months at JaggarsChiles Stovall a photographic firm that contracts to make maps for the U.S. Army... He starts work only days before the government reveals Russian missiles in Cuba and the crisis explodes.  Oswald may have had access to missile site footage obtained by the U2 planes and works alongside a young man whod been in the Army Security Agency.
All I can find out about the Williams is their tax returns are classified and that Bill Williams a descendant of the Cabots of Massachusetts has links through his family and United Fruit to the CIA and does classified work for Bell Helicopter which requires a security clearance  so what is Oswald a defector doing visiting his wife in his house? Williams has a relationship at Bell with General Walter Dornberger another one of the Nazis we brought in after the War for our missile program.  He used slave labor to build the V2 Rockets for Hitler before Bell needed him.
I dont believe it
I think Clinton is a breakthrough. Shaw denies he knows Ferrie or Oswald. Is that right?  It proves hes a liar.  Keep on it Bill. 
Im not sure I understand.
Perhaps a few more details about the evening will refresh your memory. Mr. OKeefe told us dinner was served by a uniformed waiter  a colored man.  He particularly remembers that you sat at one end and he at the other  which he found rather unusual because the table was so long.  Does that bring back memories of Willie OKeefe?
I would imagine a uniformed waiter helps.
After dinner you paid him to have sex with you.
No it was not.  Do you know an attorney by the name of Dean Andrews?
Mr. Shaw can you identify this man?
Jim dinners just about ready... Ive got a surprise for you... tried something new... Jim?  Jim dinner.
Honey you all right? 
No.  I told you I was going to talk to Shaw.
My sympathies.
Nothing is going to happen to you. I wont let it.
Just a crank making phone calls. Happens a dozen times a day at the office.
Only cowards make crank calls sweetheart nothing is going to happen.
Get a hold of yourself.
Honey come on.  The government wants you to be scared.  They want everybody to be scared to speak out.  They count on it.  But theres nothing to be scared of.
And if youre wrong?
He won... and they killed Robert Kennedy.  They shot him down.
You realize the things youre saying Willie are going to be attacked by a lot of different people.
No ones trying to buy you Willie. Its important to know why youre telling us this.
Remember whose office this was back in 63?  531 Lafayette Street.
Bill Lou were standing in the heart of the United States Governments intelligence community in New Orleans.  Thats the FBI there the CIA Secret Service ONI.  Doesnt this seem to you a rather strange place for a Communist to spend his spare time?
You dont get it guys  he cant go down any further.  We got to protect him full time.
I took it once for a low thyroid condition...  It raises the metabolism Lou.  Did David Ferrie strike you as the kind of person who had a low metabolism?
Earle Cabell.  And guess who his brother is?
His boss was the one on the Warren Commission who handled all the leads to the intelligence community.
Hell youre the District Attorney. You read the Warren Report  and then you tell me youre satisfied Lee Oswald shot the President all by his lonesome.
Welcome District Attorney Garrison. May I call you Jim?
There have been a number of reports in reputable news media  Time Newsweek our own NBC  that you have gone way beyond the legal means available to a prosecutor that youve intimidated and drugged witnesses bribed them urged them to commit perjury.  What is your response?
Pictures like this dont show up on television
Jim Garrison?
Im glad you came.  Im sorry about the precautions.
I could give you a false name but I wont.  Just call me X.
The size of this is... beyond me. Testify?
I havent yet.  I dont have much of a case.
You never ask a spook a question. No point.  Hell never give you a straight answer.  General Y still thinks of himself of the handsome young warrior who loved this country but loved the concept of war more.
And he never hit you before?
How much more?
Dave Ferrie  you know about him?
Anyone else involved at Banisters level?
Didnt someone say he didnt speak good Russian?
Sure sounds like hes winning.
Welcome Mr. Miller.  Jim Garrison. Would you care for some coffee?
You were lucky.  I spent three years in the Pacific.  Ive never seen an avenue with such a profusion of bailbonding companies. Why is that?
I know about that shot.  A terrible tragedy.  How much do you have for carrying on your investigation?
Im going to be very frank with you. Youve done a great job an astounding job considering the limited resources available to you.  But the best you can ever hope for is to stir up a lot of confusion.  Youre not going to do this country any good and youre not going to do yourself any good.  You dont belong here.  On this Mickey Mouse street with that cheap strip of bail bond shops.
Stop your investigation... it was a magnificent effort but its over and done with.  The press is already on your behind and thats only the beginning my boy only the beginning.
And you get of from school at 3 every day?
What the fuck can I say? Im serious man. What the fuck can I say? Thank you... thank you... thank you.
Whatd ya mean?
Answer the question nigga. Do you think I wanted to spend the thousand dollars on your ass? Yes or no?
You got a good lawyer?
Great youre here.
Whats she want?
The envelope contains currency... all the same denomination onehundred dollar bills. Now Im counting it.
Can we stop for cigarettes?
I dont think so.
She was more helpful than the fuckin Public Defender.  I dont know  I guess what I need is a lawyer find out what my options are.
Hes the one who wants you.
But if all I can give em is Ordells name  I dont really know shit about what he does or how he does it  That dont give me much to bargain with.
Thanks but I have my own now.
What I couldnt hear you?
Want to hear some music?
I dont know yet. Im going to talk with Dargus and Nicolet today. Do what you suggested. Offer to help and see what happens.
He needs me. Without me all that money is just gonna sit over there in Cabo. Sugar?
Well hello.
I walked right past you.
American President
You talk them into it?
I see.
Youre avoiding the question.
What do you do when he comes home?
Did you do it that night?
Howd you find out?
How does Winston find him if A.T.F. and all the local Police cant?
You worked for it  if youre sure thats all you want.
Id feel a whole lot better if you took some more money.
I thought you were tired of your business?
What if I plead guilty?
He say we like the same thing as married.
Most of the times.
Then how do you know he sells guns?
How can you help us?
Ordell has a white guy working for him named Louis.
...Compton with a fiftysixyear old petty thief  woman named Simone Hawkins.
Not yet.
I smiled and walked away. She also told me Ordell killed Beaumont.
Uhhuh.
She didnt say.
We could if Im not in jail.
What did you do after that?
Louis Garas dead. L.A.P.D. found him dead in a car on Ninth. And weve lost Ordell.
Uhuh.
How the fuck they know that?
I was thinkin the Del Amo Mall. In the food court.
Plus the same deal as before.
I dont want no more fuckin surprises. We do this the way I laid it out or we dont do it at all.
I was there I saw her do it.
It washes off. I tell them were doing it the same way as before. Theyll follow Sheronda. I hate the idea of leaving her for a fall.
Are you sure she dont know about the money?
And a hundred thousand if I go to jail.
Four years?
With Ordell?
Cmon dont lie.
Yeah that really hit the spot.
Well so far he is. But you have to admit hes not too bright.
He went to meet that stewardess.
I live here. He drops in and out. He tell you about that halfmillion dollars hes got in Mexico?
Course he did he tells everybody wholl listen. Thats what hes doin with this stewardess. Hes scheming how he can get it over here.
Let him and that stewardess get that money over here...
Were leaving now
Thats a nice outfit on her. Im gonna go over and look at this Michi Moon display.
See what did I tell you? Man in New York wants a 9 millimeter Smith and Wesson Model 5946. Why does he want it? Its the gun that nigga on New York Undercover uses. Because of that nigga I can sell it to this nigga for twelvefifty.
Uhhuh.
How much is there?
I dont hafta trust her I know her.
Uhhuh.

You shot Melanie?
Where did you shoot her?
Then what?
fore I blow that bitchs brains out Ill ask her.
You know who I saw in the dress department?
They dont have your winning personality.
Thats Winston. He works here.
Yeah.
Whos it for? A relative?
He takes off and I gotta go to Kentucky to bring him back you pay the expenses.
Comfortable?
It still sounds high.
Somebody with a grudge blew Beaumonts brains out  hey that rhymes  blew Beaumonts brains out.
Brown Jackie Brown.
If theres no  what do you call it  confidentiality between us? Why would I tell you anything?
The bond collateral on Beaumont Livingston you moved over to cover Miss Brown remember?
Im alone.
Were back.
Hello.  Hey Jackie...  No Jackie I didnt get your message.
What do you want?
Do you want some help? I can call upstairs.
Youre hurting me
Well try huh.
Things happen? What the fuck are you talking about? They did something to us Frank. We have to expose this.
Shit You know its not half the case if I go it alone. Were all suffering the same symptoms Frank. The army is to blame. Theyve done something to us. How can you not want to know?
Hey wait
Im sorry Mr. Singer but do you have any idea how many people come to me with the injustices of the world? Itd break your heart.
The army. The army. What is it with you guys? Were not talking about a trip to the library here. This is the United States Government for Gods sake. This is red tape coming out of your ass. You know what I mean?
Im too messed up to teach.
Listen will you listen? Theyre trying to get me. Theyre comin out of the walls. The armys done something to me. I need you.
You mind? Im eating huh?
I talked to the Armys Bureau of Records. Youve never even been to Viet Nam.
It means that you and your buddies are whacko that you were discharged on psychological grounds after some war games in Thailand.
Bullshit. Someones covering somethin. That was no accident.
What do you mean demons?
He was scared. He saw these creatures coming out of the woodwork. They were tryin to get him he said.
You think theyre connected?
Come on Jake. That didnt hurt.
Turn on your right side.  How about the other right?  I dont understand you philosphers. Youve got the whole world figured out but you cant remember the difference between right and left.
Ah
Jacob if it was any other brain but yours I might agree.  Tell me does your lady friend know what a brilliant thinker what a sub lime intellect shes living with?
I know very little about demons Ja cob fleshy ones anyway. I know them as literary figures biblical ones ... Dante Milton ... but Jacob  this is the 20th Century. We dont see demons now.
Look. I dont pretend to know whats going on inside your head. For all I know its pathological and they should be pumping Valium into your veins by the quart. But if youre not willing to accept the help of sci ence and believe me I admire you for that then youll have to do bat tle on your own. What can I say? Its a lonely pilgrimage through our times even for the strongest souls. But to be pursued by ... demons no less ... There are no guides Jacob.  You wanna know what Id do if I sud denly started seeing demons? Id hail the first taxi that came along shoot over to Bellvue and beg them for shock treatment. Im no saint.
What was that?
Where are you?
That help?
What happened to you?
Whered you leave em?
Thanks.  Whats that?
What?
Is that the one who died?
You okay?
Oh come on. Its early.

Dont gimme that.
Look Im horny. Keep it in mind.  Love me a little?
While you were in the shower.
I dont know. Thats all he said. He wasnt very friendly. Oh yeah. He said your buddies backed down. They chickened out he said.
Where were you Jake? Whereve you been? Why havent you called?
Im not here. You havent seen me.
What are you doing here? Are you all right? How do you expect to pay for this?  Everyones looking for you Jake. I dodged people all over the place reporters police. I dont know what youre gonna do.
Are you out of your mind?
Do what? I havent done a thing.

You just need to relax. Rizzo tis the future. We have soldiers on board EX Grunts the baddest of the bad...and their weapons? Im sure are slightly more advanced than what youre used to.

The powers back up
You son of a bitch you know what time it is?
Hypothetically how much are we talking?

Nano...but nanotechnology is impossible.
Jason Cant you see? He did this.
Thats ridiculous. Youre overreacting.
Youre not going anywhere.
So youre saying thse guys have like lasers and stuff? They could hack him to pieces?
Guys hes right behind us
My cars. And a comic book.
And uh a case of apricot brandy and you buy the lunch.
Why dont we go in? Get another crack at him tomorrow.
Hes trying to sink us
Hes chasing us I dont believe it.
How come the sun didnt used to shine in here?
Home... New York?
Colorful isnt he?
Now tell me something I dont know.
Larry if youd see these clowns leave youd never believe theyd come back with anything. But they got him
Why not Larry? We could get a positive confirmation that way.
Got a pen on you?
Im going to hire Quint to kill the fish. I want to see that shark dead.
Theres a fantail launch out there that wont make it beyond the breakwater.
Officer I wonder if you could tell me where I could find Chief Brody?
Dynamite  How was your day...?
What? What?
Whered you get all this?
Youre at the Institute full time? Or do you have a job?
What happened?
There is a kind of shark called a Great White Shark that every expert in the world agrees is a maneater.
I hope we get some more help.
This has got to be one big violation...
Think the tides with us?
And nobody else saw her in the water?
Whered you hide the Beach Closed signs?
My husband tells me youre in sharks.
Is it The bestfunded research expedition to ever study the shark... around the world in 18 months.
Well... is everything all right?
I dont need to pass basic seamanship.
Hey Squirt You want to stow this gear or you want me to use it for ballast? It aint good for much but bait.
Whats that supposed to prove?
Ill drink to your leg.
...Mako. Fell out of the tail rope and onto the deck. You dont get bitten by one of those bastards but twice  your first and your last.
Follow him
Thats disgusting This is the largest meanest most vicious shark ever landed off Amity Island and a known maneater
Yeah typically. Thats what happens when our moms and teachers get pregnant.
Yeah wizard I guess. I mean do what you think is right.
Is that normal?
Well we were once. You know that time.
Well... thanks. I think Im pretty much set until college on the Tic Tac front.
I try really hard actually...
We both have shiny happy fits of rage. You want more fans I want more stage. I dont see what anyone can see in anyone else but you.
Hey man.
Did you hear its yours?
Well Im a nail technician and I think we both ought to stick to what we know.
Just tell it to me straight Bren. Do you think this is my fault? Her mothers fault?
Im not ready to be a PopPop.
Did you see it coming when she sat us down here?
No.
Where the hell have you been Junebug?
A couple of hours? Why are you going up there in the first place?
You could have sent it to them. Why would you drive an hour out to East Jesus Nowhere?
You mean I have to wait for it to get even worse? Why cant they just give it to me now?
Good. Call me when youre OFF the rag.
This is our attorney Gerta Rauss.
So lets discuss how were gonna do this... thing.
Did your wife send you up here to spy on me?
Juno? Wow I didnt expect to see you here.
Like what?
Oh.
Titanium Power Get more snatch by the batch
Dont you remember you told me you loved me baby...
So have you and Vanessa thought of a name for the baby yet?
I weighed my options. But after all this Im glad I didnt you know get rid of it. I want to have it. For you guys.
Juno was nice enough to bring this by for us.
Cold feet.
Cool.
I... How do you think of me Juno? Why are you here?
Thats not the point. Were just not in love anymore.
You should try Adderall.
Oh thats marvelous. So youre almost into your second trimester then?
Oh its just some stuff I picked up. For you know the baby. Babies need a lot of things. I want everything to be just right.
Juno? Whats going on?
Mark? Why is Juno crying?
My partner uses these every time we have intercourse. They make his balls smell like pie.
You should have seen this octopus furnace. I had to get out my Hazmat suit just to get up in there...
They say theyre going to pay my medical expenses and everything. I promise this will all be resolved in thirtyodd weeks and we can pretend it never happened.
What?
Shes joking. Junebug has a wonderful sense of humor which is just one of her many genetic gifts.
Dealing with stuff way beyond my maturity level. Where is everyone?
I guess I wonder sometimes if people ever stay together for good.
I sort of already have.
Well well. If it isnt MacGuff the Crime Dog Back for another test?
Well you know where the lavatory is.  You pay for that pee stick when youre done Dont think its yours just because youve marked it with your urine
Yoyoyiggityyo.
Well are you going to go to Havenbrooke or Women Now for the abortion? You need a note from your parents for Havenbrooke.
Want me to call for you? I called for Becky last year.
So you were bored? Is that how this blessed miracle came to be?
Youre not listening to me.
God youre getting huge. How many months has it been now?
I wish my funbags would get bigger.
Hello. Thank you for having me and my irresponsible child over to your home.
Juno whats the matter?
What would be a good time for you?
I called Gerta Rauss. She says she can represent both of us. They call it collaborative divorce. Its apparently all the rage right now. And its easy because we dont have children.
Are you takin the pictures?
Better not or Earlyd whip me.
You know I can fix that haircut for you if you want?
You took this picture?
The police are after him hes a murderer
Did you settle things with Mr. Diebold?
...I dont know.
Nobody wants to hurt you Peaches
Think. I might just have to kill you Walter. How do you feel about that?
Brian.
Henry Lucas.
...and?
Just being there where it really happened. It was different... more visceral.
I thought you wanted to be a writer.
So hows it going?
We could have been in and out of there in less than ten minutes...
Carrie.
Whats that?
I cant believe I agreed to do this.
Brian I want him out of our car
Im sorry but I just cant see you veggin out in LALA LAND.
Aint you done enough drinking for tonight?
...never?
Youre supposed to call me when you lose your job Early. I stopped by the mirror factory today you left quite a mess behind there.
You be at this personnel office Friday three oclock sharp.
What happened?
Looks like somebody cut off his ring finger.
How many times have you gone unprotected?
What do you think?
I knew you fucked it I sat out here for like two hours That girl was like twelve and you hit it up
Well how was it?
She can fuck?
Oh shit. How long did it take?
But then when she got into it. She really got into it. It was good.
Oh man it smells like butterscotch.
And I looked at her and thought to myself Oh my god this girl is a baby.
Shit.
You wanna go to Pauls house?
78th.
You got any money?
Well those guys share everything right?
That girl you boned last year. Remember?
Man this guy is really good.
Yeah. I like her. Ive wanted to get with her for a while now.
I watched her eat the watermelon. And all this juice started running down her chin and onto her shirt.
I dont care motha fucka. Ill bet you money she fucks me.
You wanna run by the park and see what everybodys doing? Get zooted?
Whenever you see someone whos really messed up especially amputees and retards. You give them money. But if its just a regular bum you pass them by.
Nah.
Where you goin tonight?
Im goin. You on the list?
Yo you think we killed that guy?
You sure?
I dont know. I just never seen girls that did that shit before. But I think it looks nice.
I thought you had a girlfriend.
Yeah. His parents are away. Its gonna be a bug out.
Do you like kissing me?
Im telling you. Theres nothing in the world to worry about.
Nothing. Im telling you I just want to make you happy. Thats all. Just trust me.
I dont want you to hurt you. Ill be gentle.
What is it?
This makes Special K look weak. Its a euphoric blockbuster.
Come on Jennie. You look sad. Just take it.
What do I want to do?
I dont know. I just think that you would love it.
You know it wont hurt. Ill be gentle. I promise.
Have you ever had anal intercourse?
Can I ask you a question? Im sorry. I dont mean to be a pest.
No. Im OK. Thanks.
Yeah well its been a bad day.
Did you and your boyfriend just break up?
Yeah. Im not saying you should get a tattoo. But you should make yourself happy.
Your a real philosopher.
The pain. The fucking pain
You are being ripped open.
Hell yeah. I love. I love sex.
And sometimes it takes a long time and youre fucking gagging.
Wish me luck.
Come on. Dont cry. Well work it out.
I gotta go. I gotta find Telly.
Im coming.
Yeah. Mine are my toes. Oh my God if someone sucks my toes Ill come in like ten seconds
Oh shit.
Me. I can only take it up to fifteen minutes. Cause I get bored.
I made her get tested with me because I didnt want to go alone.
I hate em.
Yeah?
So thats why Casper is how he is.
Not too late.
Hey Mom. Are you sure I cant get any money? Just a few bucks.
Hello?
Hello?
What are you guys doing?
First times are always wacked. Just be glad you didnt lose your virginity in the backseat of a rental car.
Slow.
Right.
Yeah. And it takes them either too long or too short to come. Have you ever had someone that took forever
By yourself?
We seem to have a little problem here?
It wasnt serious.  Whats your problem?
Whats that supposed to mean?
Morpheus.
Are you crazy?
What in the hell do you think youre doing?  Slamming down the phone in the middle of the trace.
You dont tell us how to run our investigation.  You got that?
You got it on the board.
Were interested in where you were from the time you left the auditorium until you got there.
You sure you werent over on Pine Road?
Sorry to ruin your trip to the city but we got a real nut on our hands Frank.
Take it easy.  Both of you.
No shit
Ready for round two?
Sending yourself anonymous notes in the mail is one thing  but who called him today?
Hello Peter.
Someone whos going to become an important part of your life.  I want to play a game with you.
And  what path is that?
Hello?
But you said you didnt know her.
And you want these girls to feel your pain?
Have you any idea what the message is?
Youre playing the Tarakoss opening.
That wouldnt be very sporting. Remember Huxley?  His play is always fair and just.
Ill give you anything you want. Anything  Please
I was thinking about leaving the phone line open so you could hear her die  but Ive decided its better if you dont know exactly when I kill her. Goodbye Peter.
Sure.  Weve got a modem line hooked up with the data base in New York.
Now what?
What is it?
The police came to me for help.  What could I do?
It worked out alright didnt it?
You dont want to believe it.  Its a normal reaction.
Yeah  thats what weve always thought  but what if he wasnt?  What if I had nothing to do with the reason he came here?
You must be Erica.
Do you like my dad?
You ready?
How long has she been dead?
Any sign of rape?
Anything?
What about prints?
You mean no prints but hers?
Same as the others?
What time did he get there?
And what if hes wrong.  If you were one hundred percent sure it was Peter you wouldve arrested him.  If it is someone else then hes going to kill again tonight and youre sitting here ignoring the message.
Could you tell me where you were last night?
I know.  You won two games against him and left the auditorium at eight forty five.  Where did you go after that?
You want me to go with you?  Maybe I can help.
Hes using the map as a chessboard The sonofabitch is playing chess with me
A shadow.  Whats as big a castle?  As light as air  but one hundred men cant move it?  The shadow of the castle.  Are there any buildings that have the name Castle in it that cast a shadow long enough to fall across another building?
Where were you last night?
Then Ill transpose.
We got a problem?
Bainbridge Books.
Of course.  Yes here it is.  Why theyre all the same?
Is this your first time here?
I love this hotel.  I stay here every time I visit my parents.
It seems like such a complicated game.
Sounds very violent.
but you enjoy being the stronger one? You like the control.
Thats a very personal question.
You.
Well I think Ive had enough.
They couldnt break the riddle.
You sure you dont want to eat something?
I think its interesting.
Im just curious.
Of course.
Alright.  What about me?
It was.
What is this?
Nobody could attack you.  You set your life up like one of your chessboards. Youre impregnable  but at the same time youve become trapped behind your own defenses.  Youre cut off from everyone around you.
I just dont want to fight with you.
Thats still no excuse.  You treat everything like a game.
Youre wife died.  You cant feel responsible for that.
This letter.  Ive never opened it.
Im not nervous.
There. Now you look like someone I might want to marry.
Lyssa. Where are they keeping you?
Colwyn ...
Youll both wait. At least for five hours. The wedding is at three.
They have Lyssa
The White Castle has fallen.
The new Queen lives.
This is not the first time the Dark Ones have attacked our world. They came once before a thousand years ago. A young king and queen with extraordinary powers were given to us then to lead the struggle. My forefather was their Councilor as I will be yours.
With two or three days practice youll be able to use it as well as I can. Then well have a chance of fighting our way out of here.
There is no other way.
Yes. Each dawn it rises in a different land sometimes in the mountains sometimes in the jungle sometimes the desert sometimes the sea. Never in the same place twice.
You choose these?
She cant see out. She cant tell us where the Fortress is.
She was very faint. I was barely able to reach her.
I will melt that gold and pour it down your throat old man
Shes on the other side of this wall. I can feel it
She can see the Beast
What use is my sword? I cant reach her
I can. Because I choose it.
How did you know?
It is today?
Each to his fate.
I know the cruelty of such a fate.
Am I not beautiful enough to be loved?
I feel your pain but I cannot betray her.
Help Help Im drowning
It could have been quicksand I might have been sucked to my death.  Where is this place?
I just remembered I have urgent business in this direction.
Because you would not rob if you had no children to provide for.
They burn many villages. Even walled cities fall to them.
Yes. It will double our range.  I know at least a dozen ways to get horses. All cheap.
We could reach it on firemares.
What is that awful looking place?
Sir Ergo? ... My honorable Lord Ergo? ...
Oh she was so beautiful  and I was so uuglyu.
Put me down you lout
Passable pimple very passable.
I do not want your power. It is hideous.
Freylags stronghold?
Lord Rowan is one of Lyssas godfathers. He will defend her in the ceremony. I wish that Lord Modred were here. He is a godfather of her own blood.
For some the lure of power is stronger than the ties of blood. No matter. I had hoped to have the wedding next spring Lord Turold with all the nobles of the kingdom in attendance. But Fate and this war have ordained otherwise.
A fine match.
I tried to reach Ynyr the old one. I led a hundred men to his place in Granite Needle but it was surrounded. The Dark Ones guard it by night and by day they call out the Slayers. Ynyr cannot get out and no one can get in.
She has the power of vision.
We must reach the Valley of Reeds before the next dawn.
Go now.  Quell was wise. He knew that a man cannot ask more of his death than it help his friends.
She was not as beautiful.
She bore you many children?
You see?
Memory is no trick it is a power. The power to see.
Knowledge.
The Fortress of Krull. When will it come near here?
A young man seeks her. A young man about the age I was when I met you.
I cannot stop the sand.
Whats that mans name?
Give me his name I will mail him.
...Office 2702.
Yeah pal And I didnt say anything I said I dont know you.  But do you know what did she say that stupid Raphaella?
Well... Did you sleep with him or not?
Huh? Because of the slaughter at your same floor?
OK Im fine.
Wow Its brilliant
The yellow and pink.
Mathilda? May I come in?
Why dont you take me with you?... Im ready now.  You said I learn very quickly.
May I go to the cinema?
For musicals?  Thats part of the job
If you knew Leon...  I killed one thousand in my head...  And this never disturbed my sleep.
Its true... But a first contract its an exception.
When I say I love you.
...Shit  Wed found him. We waited for him to get upstairs and he got out of the window.
...I prefer apartments...  Furthermore there are always kids in a building. What about getting some friends?
Risky business isnt it?
Mathilda... Theres equally a lot of other things
Poor darling and then?
Well... 1... 2... 10... 100... 1000? How many approximately?
Why? Did you have too many and you fear it may shock me?  I wont get shocked. Im used to this  My father was a true pig. He fucked the bitch Id as mother all around the apartment. Whenever a door was closed you could be sure they were making sex behind it  And my sister if you didnt sleep with her youre buildings exception
...Thats awful.  I hope you killed that asshole?
May I ask you a personal question?
Maybe its the time to do something isnt it?
I dont know... Five minutes.
Huh? Move back baby I cant see anything.
Dont fear.
You cant sit here like that.
Rinaldi... Rinaldi...  What region do you come from?
...Who sent you?
Did you fish in Messina? The pesce spada?
I think I will get back in Messina this summer... Its too long I havent been there.
Salute.
Youd better talk good son because for the moment Ive got a quite bad opinion about you.  Norman smiles.
Do you recognize him?
Listen son you know as well as me this kind of hitmen they come from nowhere get the contract and disappear. Theyre lonely worse than wolves.
He probably just went somewhere.
This smells good.
If you really want to do this... plan it out.  Rest up.  Train for it.  Build up your body.  Plan every stop along the way.  How much money?  Time?  Really do it properly.  This is all so  by the seat of your pants.
I dont think you realize how serious this is Uncle.
I have to finish first.
A wife?... Did someone piss drunk run into your wife?  Crushed her like a bug.  Snapped her bones?
Youre feeling old and you want to start exercising.  A lot of men your age feel the need to recapture their youth.  Dont feel embarrassed about it.
Have I forgotten something?  Is this a special day?
Its a tremendous amount of work  moving.
Is this going to be similar to the flower incident?
I do love you... very very much.
Walk with me?
It mustve hit the window... I think its neck is broken.
I know where my heaven is.
You dont have to prove anything to her.
Whats his story?
Red flag man.
Its going to look beautiful when he turns out to be that animal who paid a visit to the Steadmans house.
Shit  He jumped
Dont worry baby it shouldnt take you more than five days if you just stop to sleep and eat.
What happened?
Youre amazing... What are you doing Mr. Parker?
Pacifica California... thats a long ways away.
There are a lot of people worried about you.
In a hospital.
They told me you might try to talk me into something... You need to rest Mr. Parker... Its for your own good.  Ive been following your story for a long while.  Its a beautiful thing you did.
Youre going to have a lot of work to do when I get back.
You look so happy  how long have you been married?
He wants to reward you... Thats why Im here.
I really want that watch.
Everythings ten dollars and theres no alcohol.
Orange soda?
Sparkling apple cider?
Mind if I use the bathroom?
Want a drink? Im having one.
If I was Im sorry.
Whats up?
Im rambling. I really like you. You make me want to talk... I dont know what time it is.
Sure... tonight. Then please stay at my place.
How long have I been here?
What do you mean?
Sera...
Dont you like me Ben?
Sera... what you dont understand is...
You can never... never... ask me to stop drinking. Do you understand?
Want a drink? Great nap. Wanna go out tonight?
Sera I love that name... S.E.R.A. Before we proceed onwards there is something I need to say. OK?
Why?
Im going to fill it right now.
I like women who wear mismatched earrings.
I told them you were an alcoholic and I would take you home. I also promised that we would never come in there again.
You were OK for a while so we walked for about a block and then you said you wanted to go home and fuck but I think even you knew that wasnt going to happen. We got a cab and you asked him to stop at a liquor store even though I told you that we had plenty at home. In the store you gave the kid a hundred and told him to keep the change. I asked you if you knew it was a hundred. You said you did so I let you do it. We got here you fell asleep on the couch and I covered you up and came to bed.
Very creative. Now we can get you a black bow tie and you can look like one of those casino dealers.
The news is not good kid. This bit here... see there... its broken. You need a new  one.
Please dont raise your voice. I wont bother you about it again.
You have been lonely?
Well then. Youll need excellent recommendations from your professors a heck of an admissions essay and at least a oneseventyfive on your LSATs.
Brooke I believe you. But a jury is gonna want an alibi.
He thinks Im guilty doesnt he?
Its so shameful...
I have made my fortune on my ability to teach women how to perfect their bodies with the Brookes Butt Buster workout.
So at some point in the  twenty minutes you were in the shower your father was shot?
Chutney why is it that Tracy Marcinkos curls were ruined when she got hosed down?
Dewey Newcomb?
Come again?
Was she carrying a weapon?
So she was distraught that her husband was dead?
Mr. Salvatore do you have any proof that you and Mrs. Windham were having an affair?
Yes?
Could I be anymore goddamn spastic?  So youre sure this Warner guy is the one?
And after they set his nose he came back for his truck and I offered to drive for him since he was still on painkillers and we spent the whole afternoon together He was unconscious for part of it but it was really fun
Im here to see Brooke Windham.
Hi. Sarah Knottingham.
The idiot speaks.
Warner cant even do his own laundry.
Why else would she have flown in from Newport? Its not like shed Fed Ex a six carat diamond.
What if  you know  its not the night?
I dont know Everything was normal at first and then he said he needed someone more   Serious
We still love you. Sisters forever
Do they just  put you on the spot like that? Like all the time?
Good luck.
Aside from that.
Why?
How can you still believe shes innocent?
Whoa  Why?
So now youre  ?
Oh my God
Up for a celebration dinner?
Someone missed you.
Thank you Serena but I dont think itll do any good.
Yes? Ms. Woods?
Maiden name  Daniels.  You know her?
Class schedule map book list.
Im fully amenable to that discussion.
Proposing? Elle If Im going to be a politician I need to marry a Jackie not a  Marilyn.
Cmon. Let me take you home.
You go where?
Now I am.
I didnt mean 
In court. On opposing sides.
But I guess it wasnt enough for Brooke.
We come watch... we come watch...
What?
We watch... good fun...
On the contrary  The puling pallid creature you were before was truly something disgusting.  Now you are splendid... a fierce goddess... the embodiment of all that is strong and beautiful.
Then why hide behind a mask?  You are ashamed
Do you feed on mice and rats?
When the times come you wont need to jump Ill throw you out myself
And I with you... I never dreamed life held such pleasures...
What?  Speakee loud  No hear velly good.
No need lie boy.  I no hurt you. Do I look like I wanna hurt you?
Flozen foleva not good.
An how you do it?  How you rift cuss?
So Jack... think you be a Green Man and not know Gump.
Aye Honeythorn Gump come to serenade you Jack... come to make you dance.
Generally known  What general ever knew more than to lace up his boots?
Did you hear?  Twas the killing of the unicorn caused it.
If the horn be restored the curse is ended.
Twill take more than heart.  Where do we find the armor of Achilles for a start?
Theres the spirit lad.  If ye run into trouble give a yank here and well haul ye up.
There be no finer victuals than worm flesh lad.
What is it?
Pregnant is she?
There... it seems to quit... Ill wager that war held other attractions quite apart from nursing.
My God  Look
Certainly understandable.
Archers  Bring down that spider Ill deal with this other creature...
Is she... dead?
Never felt so cold in all me born days...
Dont like the feel of it Jack.
Easily spoken...
Thats it  The unbreakable line Well tie it to an arrow and fire it up into the timbers above the portculis... then Ill climb up and chop down the drawbridge.
Easily... The question is can we save ourselves?  Be a shame to win the battle only to lose the war.
The Baron hides in the dark in a passage under the Castle... Quick give me the dwarfs key... the one which opens any lock...
Aye.  Hurry now Gump the key
Im not afraid of the dark.
Seems to be some sort of vaulted chamber up ahead...
Keep me belly full Jack.  Kill us another worm.
Barely living from the looks of it.
Ogg lives there...  And Thurgis
Sweet slippers of Oisin
Aye... my Lord...
Greetings my lady the green wood is honored.
A gentleman would offer water.
What shall we do?
Ive lost my napkin.  It was all elfwork and lace... I must have dropped it when you startled me so.
The napkin will keep.  Id rather not be alone.
How bad was the unicorns wound?
Not even the birds sing sweet as you.
No  I wont let it happen...
Sweet Jack.  Im so sorry you found me asleep.  Dont know what came over me.
Biting you?
Step lively now
Whats this now?
The moon is too round of face methinks.
I dont believe you.
Sweeter than bee pollen on a summer wind.
I would build a wall around me with such stone so the likes of you might never enter.
Whats she doing?
Im in your debt Screwball.
Maybe theres a better idea... What about birds... get a lift from some friendly bird...
Your fond wishes give me strength dear friends.
Each fit for a hero... My uncle fashioned a hammer for Thor.  Twas he named it Mjolnir.  Grandfather forged Excalibur... You wont ever see finer craftsmanship.
No hurt Jimmy sir... oh no please sir...
Can you show us the way?
It be the castle... we feel the castle... it be that close...
And video games after
Whats that for?
So put your plans of my room in the trash.
Do you guys feel like painting?
I couldnt get it to go down.
Why?  What do you mean?
Are you his friend?
I had them in my pocket.
Youre a good girl.
Wheres your dad?
Hes a freak.
I cant even take a shower here.
Your dad dated my mom after her divorce.

Because you felt like a Runner didnt you.
Its getting dark and cold. Im tired.
It all seemed to make sense until Box.

They all have names and numbers on them. I wonder what they are?
We cant. Were going back.
Beloved son...  So people stayed together for that feeling of love... They would live and raise children together and be remembered.  I think I feel that way Logan. Can we be that way?
And Sanctuary?

Oh thank you. Thank you
Oh yes. There is a tribe of porters some five hundred miles from here. That is our only contact with the outside world. Every now and again depending upon favorable weather of course they make the journey.
A fine trick Smart arent you? What a pack of lies you told us about those porters Of course the minute they arrive we can make arrangements to leave. If they take us. But you knew very well youd tell them not to
The High Lama? Who pays any attention to him? The porters laugh at the High Lama. All they want to know is how much gold he will give them. Well I gave them more gold. Ive been stealing it for a year. Id do anything to get out of this place. To get away from that High Lama  the one who calls himself Father Perrault Why hes been insane for years

You must not look to me for help. Your brother is no longer my problem. He is now your problem Conway.
I have waited for you my son for a long time. I have sat in this room and seen the faces of newcomers. I have looked into their eyes and heard their voices  always in hope that I might find you . My friend it is not an arduous task that I bequeath for our order knows only silken bonds. To be gentle and patient to care for the riches of the mind to preside in wisdom while the storm rages without.

Well I  I really dont know what to say. Except that you must be completely mad.

So everyone is serenely happy in ShangriLa? Nobody would ever think of leaving?  Its all just so much rot Shes pleaded with me ever since I came here to take her away from this awful place. Shes cried in my arms for hours for fear Id leave her behind. And whats more shes made two trips to the plateau to bribe the porters  for me
Bob cant you get them to wait for us? Theyre leaving us farther behind every day.

Is it my eyes... or is that thing a little...
Okay.  If youve got a bug problema big one.  And theyre swarming and theres no way to shoot them all individually... how do you get rid of them?

I put you away 
Theres food in the refrigerator. Make sure you drink a lot of water.
It goes from the bathroom to the kitchen.
I dont ever see any of you precops down here Im not in trouble am I?
Victims a white female.
Thats an old one.  One of our first.
Thats right.  Its a combined data stream based on all three previsions.
You the only sentry?
Whys he still a John Doe?  Why wasnt he ever IDs from an EYEscan?
Tell me not to worry John.
And this is exactly the kind of behavior that will give them an excuse to do it.
I need you to do two things for me. One watch Danny Witwer.
If hes looking for a flaw in the system 
Lara called me.
Just so you know Ive overridden the vehicle locator.  I just wanted to talk to you before Justice

At least now you  and I  have the chance to make sure that kind of thing doesnt happen to anyone ever again.
You set me up...
I cant touch you  And John you cant be in here  Youll confuse them
She was looking right at me.
Im impressed Anderton.  Youre on the lam but you still got the time and energy to slice off a little jerky for yourself.
Stop 
I scored a goal
Sean 
I forgive you.
I wanted to.
... and that I needed his help.  It wasnt so bad really.  I sang him a song made him laugh bought him a pretzel.  I took care of him.  I made him happy.
Youre not gonna kill me?
Tell me who was it set this up?
You dont seem all that proud.
Jesus Christ  why didnt I know about this?
Why?
Answer my question.  Did Lamar Burgess know about the Minority Report?
You want to bring it down.
Where?
Thats all huh?  Just walk right into Precrime go into the Temple somehow tap into the Precogs and then download this Minority Report...
 and then walk out.
Ill get EYEscanned a dozen times before I get within ten miles of Precrime.  Theyll pick me up...
Which one is that?
I havent worn this damn thing in years.  I just wanted to make sure it fits before tonight.
John said something about him being set up because he found out about her.
Lamar do you know the reason why John came here to work with you?
He came to see you yesterday. Right before he got tagged.  What did you talk about?
Lamar I found something.
Its the same prevision.
So there is a way to fool the system?
Of course it would have to be someone with access to the Prevision in the first place someone fairly high up 
So if you wanna kill someone you take him to Miami.
Dont worry.  Ill bring him in unharmed.
It doesnt matter.  He wins.
There a maid in this hotel?
If you were a child killer you took these pictures would you leave them out on the bed for anyone to find?

1 2 8 hit didnt it?
You saved my life Archie. Running me out of Harlem. When I think how close we came to gunning each other down I have to thank Allah.
If you aint trying to punk me whats your hype?
What did you give it to me for then?
You aint lying.
Like what? Looking like me? Like a nigger? Why dont you want to look like what you are? What makes you ashamed of being black?
I respect myself. A man cuss because he hasnt got the words to say whats on his mind.
Where am I gonna start?
Allah has sent us a prophet a black man named Elijah Muhammad. For if God is black Malcolm 
I knew youd hear me. The white man is the devil. All white men are devils.
You are now Benjamin 2X.
Folks are sitting out there today not next week expecting to hear our program.
Make it plain.
Women talk too much. To tell a woman not to talk is like telling Jesse James not to carry a gun or a hen not to cackle. And Samson the strongest man that ever lived was destroyed by the woman who slept in his arms.
I see your point.
Youre from Detroit near where I come from. You majored in education at Tuskegee. Youre studying nursing and having trouble with your family.
Theres a few things you dont know about women Brother Malcolm. Theyre possessive and vain.
And dogged when I set my mind to something.
Theres always talk always been talk and always will be talk. Dont they say how Im trying to take over the Nation how Im getting rich off the Nation?
Los Angeles UPI Elijah Muhammad 67yearold leader of the Black Muslim Movement today faced paternity suits from two former secretaries who charged he fathered their four children...
To Bembry? Is Bembry your friend?
A long time ago. Youve repaid them many times over. Ask them why they have new cars and houses full of new furniture.
Im sorry. I havent been the best husband or father.
Families shouldnt be separated. Ill never make another long trip without you and the kids. Well all be together.
Malcolm they keep calling threatening us. Im going crazy when is this going to stop?
Brother Earl.
Lets cancel.
Now just a moment just a moment 
Mr. X is a demagogue. He has no place to go so he exaggerates. Hes a disservice to every good lawabiding Negro in the country. Can I ask you a question?
If you want to tell me.
Are you Elijahs pimp?
Bout every other night Red.
I mean its late baby.
Malcolm you can be anything you want. You got class and youre smart.
I think sometimes Mrs. Little candor is the only kindness.
Did you hear me?
Another one?
To wire your car so it would explode when you turned the ignition. The Ministers say you are spreading untruths about the Messenger. The Ministers say you are a great hypocrite Judas Benedict Arnold. The Ministers say your tongue should be cut out and delivered to the Messengers doorstep.
You evil this morning.
Yeah girl thats your story. When you gonna holler rape sister?
You will baby  if the time come.
Baby I was gonna give it to you.
You had the number.
Hey man gimme some skin.
I forgot to tell you Im wearing a bulletproof vest.
Baby I love you. Take it easy greasy. How about a snort?
You is something Homeboy. My trouble is  I aint had enough stuff yet I aint et all the ribs I want and I sure aint had enough white tail yet.
Im half wop half nigger and aint afraid of no one.
Then I put him to bed and pour talcum powder on him like a baby. He gets his jollies off.
Who the hell are they?
Brother Minister he often talked about you. He loves you loves you like his own son. Says you are the best his greatest Minister but that someday you would leave him and turn against him.
Yes I am Brother Minister. All I want is support for my children. He should provide for his children. Thats all I want.
You have a rather checkered past. Mr. Creasy. Your Interpol file is six pages long.
The last few days may represent the best police work of my life.
You walk out and deal justice. Youre what I wish I could be.  The policemen who kills you his family will have all they want.
Where are you coming from?
Senor?
I traced the PIN. I have an address for you. But I need to see you.
Daniel.
No offense but Im sorry that your profession needs to exist.
Do you ever see the hand of God in what you do?
I dont know I swear.
Im professional. I just do my job.
I see him sometimes at the handball court in Chapultepec on a Saturday afternoon.
The most important thing in life is family. And there you are. You have my family. What do you want?
This is not possible. But in that house I have money. If I tell you where 
What do you mean?
That he used policemen. That you killed them it made it a police matter. The Ramos family couldnt refuse our involvement.
And I had my men ready.
Two and a half. Thats how much there was.
And what if amateurs try it?
When did Mexican Customs start getting smart?
What are you doing here?
Bullshit. Ive known you fifteen years. You dont visit.
Theres still ink on my fingers from last week.
Creasy?
Fuck. Look at you you wont last a day the shape youre in. Unless you stop bleeding you should have your spleen removed.
Being black is that a positive or negative for a bodyguard in Mexico?
Were taking a different way home.
Not at all?
Youre fast.
Do you think hell come back?
Hows the ankle? Can you put your weight on it?
Why do you ask?
What did you do in Asia? Is that where you met the man with cigarettes?
Do you have a girlfriend Creasy?
Could I ask you a question?
You dont drink like you used to.
My mom drinks too... Why do people drink Creasy?
Is the food alright? Maria tells me that you didnt eat.
You should know theyre tenacious when they want something. And Pinta wants to be friends.
Why are you here? Why didnt you die?
Creasy... Wait.
And Lisa will be able to save face. We wont be the only family without a bodyguard.
For an American she understands this country very well.
Could he speak English? Emilio couldnt speak English.
Yes mom?
Hell die of his wounds bleed to death before he can do anything.
I know this. Your point?
Then what do you have to lose?
Is it true? Creasy saved the little girl that was kidnapped yesterday.
And as long as were talking information theres something else as well.
Tell me about your friend Creasy.
None of your business. Or mine for that matter. I got nothing more to say.
Hell deliver more justice in a weekend than ten years of your courts and tribunals. So stay out of his way.
I told you she wasnt especially attractive but that she had a good deal of charm and shes really a real nice girl...
Millies been after me to fix her up with a date so I...
Hey Herbie...
You wanna have a drink before we start dancing?
Well what do you feel like doing tonight?
I could see she likes you.
Theres a nicelooking little short one for you right now.
Who you gonna call?
Are you kidding?
Marty lets go downna SeventySecond Street area tonight.
Boy you really musta made out good last night.
Who told you that?
I dont think I remember him.
Ufa
Ah?
Oh sure.  This girl is a college graduate.
I cry a lot too. Im a big cryer.
Oh I cry all the time any little thing. My brothers my brotherin laws theyre always telling me what a goodhearted guy I am. Well you dont get goodhearted by accident. You get kicked around long enough you get to be a real professor of pain. I know exactly how you feel. And I also want you to know Im having a very good time with you now and really enjoying myself. So you see youre not such a dog as you think you are.
So there you are. So I guess Im not such a dog as I think I am.
You gotta real nice face you know? Its really a nice face.
Im a Catholic you know and even to think about suicide is a terrible sin.
Well I wouldnt call it an elegant profession. Its in a lower social scale. People look down on butchers.
Its only a quarter of twelve. The clocks right over there.
Oh you wont be so lonely. Youll make friends right away.
This is the kitchen.
Marty...
The reason I cant be definite about it now is my Aunt Catherine is probably coming over tomorrow and I may have to help out.
Waddaya doing New Years Eve?
What happened Angie was that we thought we were just gonna go for a short walk and then we thought we were gonna come right back but we got to talking. Listen Angie I want you to meet Clara...  Clara this is my best friend Angie. I told you about him.
No thank you really Mrs. Pilletti.
Couldnt she find some sort of hobby to fill out her time?
Where do you think a motherinlaw should go?
You say something?
What?
And that husband of hers is a skinny bit of a fellow isnt he?
What I like about Mickey Spillane is he knows how to handle women. In one book he picks up a tomato who gets hit with a car and she throws a pass at him. And then he meets two beautiful twins and they throw passes at him. And then he meets some beautiful society leader and she throws a pass at him and...
Wadda you wanna buy a shop for will you tell me? You gotta good job you got no wife you got no responsibilities. Boy I wish I was you boy. Waddaya wanna tie yourself down with a shop? Whats he want? Five thousand down? Youre gonna have to carry a mortgage sixty seventy bucks a month. A mortgage anna note from the bank. For Petes sake youre a single man with no responsibilities. Stay that way boy. Take my advice.
Ha Who told you about the Stardust Ballroom?
Howd you come home Ma? Thomas give you a ride?
Ma Im gonna take her home now. Its getting late and the buses only run about one an hour.
What are you talking about? Shes a nice girl.
So these two girls come over to the bar...
...and they sit down right next to me...
I look over at this one nexta me not bad about thirtyfive  Hiya Marty...
When you gonna get married Marty? You should be ashamed of yourself. All your brothers and sisters they all younger than you they married and they got children. I just saw your mother inna fruit shop and she says to me Hey you know a nice girl for my boy Marty? Watsa matter with you? Thats no way. Now you get married.
Sure.
Well theres the Stardust Ballroom. Thats a kind of a big dance hall. Every Saturday night its just loaded with girls. Its a nice place to go. You pay seventyseven cents. It used to be seventyseven cents. It must be about a buck and half now. And you go in and you ask some girl to dance. Thats how I met Virginia. Nice respectable place to meet girls. You tell Marty Aunt Theresa you tell him Go to the Stardust Ballroom. Its loaded with tomatoes.
Aunt Theresa we figure the best way to ask her is you say that youre very lonely see? And wouldnt she come and keep you company because that way you see...
No Virginia I know how you feel.
Listen lets go downa Kaplans apartment. They told us to come down.
Marty I dont know how to tell you how much I appreciate what you and your mother are doing because the kinda thing was happening in our house was Virginia was in the kitchen making some milk for the baby. So my mother comes in...
Tommy
I know what youre gonna say. A mans gotta stop being his mothers baby sooner or later. How many times you gonna say it? Shes my mother you know. I oughta have some feelings about her dont you think?
Tommy...
What about the time she wanted to make an oldfashioned Italian dinner for my brother but you wouldnt let her?
Once a month you couldnt let her use the kitchen
I dont think I can give absolution to a man whos about to commit suicide. Its a mortal sin.
Good. Youve both been working close to the front.
I may need you to go to work practically immediately. But meanwhile perhaps youd like to meet some of your fellow officers.
You boysll have to go to work early.
What are you going to do with him?
Stop him Stop that man
Now I got you for a witness Im going to try again. So far all I dragged out of him is hes from Bahston and hes only been in the Army two months.  Where were you when they drafted you?
Dont you use olives?
How you Walt? We was just fixing to have a nightcap.
Yall mind the store.
Us. Lead us not into...
You mind if we get out of this guys brain first?
My names Hawkeye Pierce.
Make it yourself or is it real?
Colonel Blake have no fear. Hawkeye and Duke are here.
No Hawkeye just said it all.
Yeah thats right.  You better get us a chestcutter before theres trouble.
Must be Painlees Pole Day in the Shower Tent.
When will he be able to write?
I guess thats why you go for Hot Lips Houlihan.
How can you say a thing like that about an officer in the United States Army?
Where the hell we going to get us a football team?
Look at the size of those two beasts.
Oh Im used to it. What makes me sore is how they behave towards you.  They ought to be grateful to have you.  I certainly am.
I was just asking...
If we had closer relations there wouldnt be any misunderstandings. Thats where a football game would help. Between your outfit and mine.
Gimme three.
Im going to play poker until three a.m. or until the patient is ready for surgery. However if youd like to operate on him yourself right now be my guest. I get the same dough whether I work or not.
Radar
What for?
BERT right. See you tomorrow.
I think Ive seen this nut somewhere.  Havent I?
I came within about ten yards of you. You know something Trapper the way we been going if we ever got to see a real golf course again I bet we could burn it up.
But besides the operation weve got to get in at least eighteen holes of golf.
Best thing you could do for all of us is grab some sack time.
Well have to close this hole and make one on the other side.
Its five minutes into nurses shower hour. Where are they?
But hes got five times the manpower to draw on.
But wed have to break his leg or something to keep him out of the game for good.
Captain Pierce would I be imposing...?
The bastards outconned us.
If you start the game instead of waiting you mean?
Youre getting a workout you and Captain Forrest your first night.
I dont make the distinction. But the sex urge is a powerful force. In women just as much as men.
In less than twelve hours Ill be on my way.
Dear sweet Hawkeye.
How would he avoid it... as if I needed to ask?
Youre asking for somebody else?
Its your decision Maria. I dont want to highpressure you.
Be the longest shortarm inspection you ever held
Whats the story?
Whats wrong with him?
Or in dreams either. I repressed it completely. Classic pattern of inhibition.
I have not understood what you means.
Officer all sleep now yes? And I go wash clothes.
Hi HoJon. How they goin?
The blonde dish.
Well find out what they are when you throw us out.
Stop acting like a colonel Henry. You know Trapper wouldnt sock him without a good reason.
Fifteenth straight day thereve been six oclock choppers. How long can a battle go on?
Whats going on? Who started this?
We got it men... HoJons keep as Androscoggin... if there is such a place. And the big news is the General wants a rematch.
OReilly
Sir?
To Major Burns tent. Yes sir.
Sir?
Splendid sir. No problems.
If I can make a suggestion Coach.
Yeah?
Soup? Rice? What are we doing beginning all over again?
We dont have to see him. Call that halfassed Army hospital and tell them to be ready to put some lipiodol in this kids esophagus and take X rays.
Did you get it too?
Would you be willing to say you wrote that letterand stick by it?
Oh come on now. This is serious. Youre a man disgusted with all of civilization.
Never mind those guys. All right stand up. Now lets see what you look like when you protest.
Yes
Who?
Oh. Yeah.
Hello John.
Look John. Something terribly importants happened. Theyre forming John Doe Clubs. We know of eight already and they say that theres going
Oh it started as a circulation stunt but it isnt any more. Mr. Norton wants to get back of it and sponsor John Doe Clubs all over the country. He wants to send you on a lecture tour.
Can I help you pack?
Well yes I was. But I was your father then see?  But the real me John Doe er that is Long John Willoughby I was the fellow up there with the book. You know what I mean?
Did you write this?
How much money do you get?
Thank you very much for everything.
Oh
What for? I gave you fifty just the other day.
Youre marvelous Ma. Youre just like Father used to be. Do you realize a couple of weeks ago we didnt have enough to eat ourselves?
Oh yes Father certainly would.
Yeh D. B. Oh just cleaning out the deadwood. Okay.
Ill tell you what Ill do. I get thirty dollars a week. Ill take twentyfive twenty if necessary. Ill do anything you say.
The whole towns in an uproar. Weve got to find him. The letters our only clue.
Well the whole towns curious about John Doe and boom just like that youre going to bury him. Theres enough circulation in that man to start a shortage in the ink market
John Doe.
Now then comes the drama. He meets discouragement. He finds the world has feet of clay. His ideals crumble. So what does he do?  He decides to commit suicide in protest against the state of civilization. He thinks of the river  But no no he has a better idea. The City Hall. Why?  Because he wants to attract attention. He wants to get a few things off his chest and thats the only way he can get himself heard.
So you think this is worth a thousand dollars do you?
Looks all right
Thats our man. Hes made to order.
Thinks its terrific. Says for us to go the limit. Wants us to build a bonfire under every big shot in the state.
Well okay. But we dont want more than a couple o hundred people in on this thing. Now the first thing I want is an exact copy of the John Doe letter in your own handwriting.
Look. We cant let em get to this bushleague pitcher and start pumping him. Good night  No telling what that screwball might do. I walked in yesterdayhere he is standing on a table with a fishing pole flycasting. Take my advice and get him out of town before this thing explodes in our faces
Whats the idea?
How many is that six? Pretty hungry werent you?
Had any schooling?
Baseball?
Whos got him?
Well anyway II guess nearly everybody in the neighborhood came except the DeLaneys. The Delaneys live in a big house with an iron fence around it and they always keep their blinds drawn and we always figured that he was just an old miser that sat back counting his money so why bother about inviting him? Until Grimes the milkman spoke up and he said Say youve got the Delaneys all wrong. And then he tells us about how they cancelled their milk last week and how when he found a note in the bottle he got kinda curious like and he sorta peeked in under the blinds and found the house empty. If you ask me he says theyre starving.
Well sir about a dozen families got together and gave Grubbel a job watering their lawns. Isnt that wonderful? And then we found jobs for six other people and theyve all gone off relief
Hey pretty nifty huh?
Hey stop worrying Colonel. Fifty bucks aint going to ruin me.
You win Colonel. Heres the fifty. Go on out and get rid of it.
Yeah shes a heelot just like the rest of them. Its lucky you got away from her.
Join the John Doe Club.
I get mad for a lot of other guys besides myselfI get mad for a guy named Washington And a guy named Jeffersonand Lincoln. Lighthouses John Lighthouses in a foggy world You know what I mean?
Only one thing to do Hank. Drop the whole business quickly.
Miss Mitchell do me a favor will you? Go on out and get married and have a lot o babiesbut stay out o newspaper business
Did you write that letter to Miss Mitchell?
How about family? Got any family?
Thats a lie
Thats got nothing to do with it
Oh
What do you mean too bad?
Yeah but how am I gonna get my arm fixed?
Yes Spencer. Who? The Governor? Well what about me? its my building hes jumping off of And Im up for reelection too
No  you cant do that.

Wheres the stereo?
Whats the line?
God damn it I still needed to case that fucking store. Its too risky to show my face now.
You gotta do this for me. Im in here because of you.
Whos controlling your mind?
This has nothing to do with Walter.
Wheres the car?
Who are you again?
Thats right and a plane waiting at the airport. If he doesnt...
For now thats all.

Whats the point of this?
Youd never been out of New York?
You wouldnt want to put a small wager on this would you?
Shes back in Jersey... going to graduate school.
Lesson two Dead Eye... should have been lesson one. Never exchange yourself for a hostage.
If you want to be a successful negotiator youve got to learn to lie.
My names McCall. Im unarmed.
The 6 horse is last.
To run last?
And what about the ones you dont save?
And what if you cant live with it?
I cant leave Ray. Its part of my negotiators oath. Once Im in the room with the hostage I have to stay.
I worship you.
That a new picture?
Oh hell forget it. This wont work.
Its already started.
What are you talking about? This is it. This is the stuff right here.  Well maybe just a pinch more sugar.
Its not that world. Its your world. Its part of who you are.
Yeah?
Hmm?
I was just thinking...  Theres something special I want to talk to you about.  I think its time we went to a whole other phase in our relationship.  A deeper level.
Stay up there Girl...
Theres been some concern about you continuing to work without backup.
Its been decided that you take on another partner and train him to be able to take over for you.
You know youve got nothing but cars down there in impound.
The car is part of the deal.
Roper...
What do you need?
Its okay.
Why?
Whats happening?
But what would happen to me?  I have no body to return to.
Divinity?

Does Maranzano have to kiss you on the lips before youll take his goddamn money?
The deals too good Frankie
Something came up.
Why do you bother with perfume when you smell like this?
Come on Charlie. We gotta have a top guy. Otherwise these wars aint never gonna stop.
Charlie Im from the old country and these American ways get me sometimes confused. You tellin us you refuse the title of Boss of All the Bosses?
Julius Caesar never took no vote.
Well figure out something.
Like Don Maranzano.
Its just that Maranzanos the only bastard I ever heard brag about gettin audited by the IRS. He came out clean so he thinks his shit dont stink.
We got exactly two choices Maranzano or Masseria.
What you mean? Tommy aint done nothin.
Whys it gotta be Tommy

Good liquor draws a good crowd.
Mussolini is raping Sicily like every Roman before him. So our brothers are coming to America. Soldiers willing to fight and die. Men who know the meaning of honor.
The Internal Revenue came to my offices. I turned over all my ledgers. They found nothing. Charlie I am a businessman.
We combine everything. You are my second in command.
The terms will be mine.
I will be the Boss of All Bosses.
You think this is a coincidence? Next week half your customers will be buying their Scotch our Scotch from Maranzano. In a month hell be in Scotland talking to my distillers because you cant move product. Ill be out of business and youll be working for Maranzano.
Strategy.
Know somethin? This stuffs just kickthecan on ponies.

Look out for those fellowsthey tell the truth about yousometimes. That corner over there is reserved for guides and sightseers who come in for five minutes to rest their feet. That section over there is reserved for Senators friends. The front rowthe empty oneis for the President and White House guests see that old couple over there theyve attended every session for the last twenty years. Over the clock back here is the Diplomatic section. They and the page boys are the only real class we have in this place. The rest are mostly people who come here like they go to the zoo
All the exvicePresidents. You can get tentoone around here if you think you can remember their names. The VicePresident presides over the Senateyou know that. Its how he earns his pay. Ohover there Senator on the east side of the Chair we still have the old snuff boxes with real snuff in them if you like snuff.

A pet shop?
All right Senatorlets get these bags and the livestock together
You should hear our Ranger Band rattle that offif you want to hear something Good evening Miss Saunders. Good evening Mister McGann.
Will the Senator yield?
Has the gentleman the effrontery standing there convicted and in disgraceto try to force the postponement of that bill?
Will the Senator yield for a question?
Yeah Dad always used to say the only causes worth fighting for were lost causes.
I know. I suppose Mr. Paine when a fellow bucks up against a big organization like that one man by himself cant get very far can he?
Senator Paine if I could do just that one thing while Im here I Id feel that I
Thank you sir. Thank you for your time.
Gosh  Welllooks good as new. If there is any damage Ill
Mr. President
Will the Senator
Yes Ma?
But you have some objections here and there. And maybe right for all I know. But the point istheres no sense stopping the whole works now specially after some men have worked hard for a long time to put this through
Whats your name?
Whose statue is that?
The Capitol Dome Lighted up
Convenethats ityes. I got to pick up some of those parliamentary words. I imagine a fellow can get pretty lost in the Senate without em
Were going right ahead withwhat?
My dear Senator have you the faintest idea of what it takes to get a Bill passed?
Thats how Congressor any large bodyis run. All work has to be done by committee.
Pardon methis is. Where are we now?
Yes. House. More amendmentsmore changesand the Bill goes back to the Senateand waits its turn on the calendar again. The Senate doesnt like what the house did to the Bill. They make more changes. The House doesnt like those changes. Stymie. So they appoint men from each house to go into a huddle called a conference and battle it out. Besides that all the lobbyists interested give cocktail parties for and againstgovernment departments get in their two cents worthcabinet membersbudget bureausembassies. Finally if the Bill is alive after all this vivisection it comes to a vote. Yes sirthe big day finally arrives. Andnine times out of ten they vote it down.  Are you catching on Senator?
It hasnt been easy has it?
I never met anyone moremore intelligentor capable. II dont know where Id be on this bill of mine without your help
No Gosh I better get moving here Miss Saunders  Everybody else calls you just plain Saunders. Why cant I?
Abigail.
GeeI hope so. Whats all this?
Do you mean alllooklook wed better open them upsee what they say herelook at the moneywhat does it sayDear Senator Smith I would like to come to your boys camp and I shine shoes at the station and heres nine cents. Oh isnt that wonderful. Look and he signs it. Yours truly Stinky Moore. Isnt that marvelous?  Sayhave I got some paper here?
The letters? Goshno. I couldnt talk letters. Ive gotta scratch em out. And sayIm going to tell Ma all about you. If I tell it right the first thing you know youre going to get the best jar of preserves you ever tasted.
Yesright here. Just a second  Miss Paine.
And youre writing Ma all about it. And your pigeons will carry the message of love. And the first thing you knowSusan Painell get the best jar of preserves she ever tasted
No. That nightIwell you know I was pretty. NoDiz is aa sort of brother thats all
I dont think thats the thing to do No I think what you ought to do isfight 
Ah Thats more like it What?
Gentlemen Gentlemen are supposed to believe in something decent. Instead of twisting facts and making a joke of everythingwhy dont you tell the people the truth for a change?
Howhow do you do Miss Paine?  II apologize for looking like this II have to be going now
Oh the bill. OhsplendidI mean  II just cant seem to talk in this suit.  Ill tell you a secret. Its brand new.
Order gentlemen
Yes. Washington laid the cornerstone thoughwearing an apron for the ceremony that was embroidered by Madame Lafayette
Ax?
Hya Carlhya Bill
I know that.
Jims methods wont do in Washington.
Ive used every argument in the world to try to turn him off. He just keeps coming back to the dam and what he knows
Your Rangers on the garbage pile Happy Hes done for
Who? Who? Your boss A nut huh? A nut Wow Theres a story in this guy I smelled it
Thats right.
Well when I first came to Washington my eyes were big blue question marks now theyre big green dollar marks
What do you want Senator?
Oh its all rightits all right. It seems a shame though to part company like this after all these years especially now with a national convention coming up. Joe Ive put everything I have behind you. And so did all of our friends but I guess well survive. Well just have to find somebody else thats got a little more sense thats all. In the meantime you explain to Mr. Smith about Willet Dam. Its your bill its your reputation and if he cant find enough facts to break you with you just send him to me and Ill give him a couple of good ones. Im taking the next plane home.
Jim
Its in your lap Joe. Keep an eye on him. If he gets to his feet and says anything
His first whiff
Fatheroh.
Well at the expense of some of the furniture Susanyouve made another conquest.
Will the Senator yield?
I accuse this manby his toneby his careful denialshe is deliberately trying to plant damaging impressions of my conduct Ill tell you why we were in tht room. Because Mr. Taylor a respected citizen of our State had brought with him the evidence against this man later presented from this floor and we were urging him to resign 
Mr. President will the Senator yield for a question?
Is there objection?  You may proceed Senator.
No. Dont ever want to go out without telling us.
Good morning.
I say my friend do you know a fellow by the name of Longfellow Deeds?
He walks in the rain without his hat and talks to himself.
For no reason I guess. He always does it. We always run into the house when we see him coming.
Are you married?
Did you subsequently write a series of articles about him?
Oh thank you
Oh no really  Ill be all right.
Feel better now?
The Aquarium was swell. If I lived in New York Id go there every day. Ill bet you do.
Would you like to walk the rest of the way? Its so nice out.
Oh they just do it to sell the newspapers you know.
The drums. He taught me to play some.
All my life Ive wanted somebody to talk to. Back in Mandrake Falls I always used to talk to a girl.
Hello Mary?
Search me. Ask the Gypsies.
The guys balmy.
Youre a fool Babe.
Just a minute. No you dont.
Cinderella Man Thats sensational Babe Sensational
Youre a genius Babe  a genius
Proposed to you You mean he asked you to marry him?
Tell him youre Babe Bennett? Tell him youve been making a stooge out of him?
Thats the rub.
Ow My foots asleep
I know Budington. We cant afford to have the books investigated right now. You must have said that a thousand times already.
dont want to be critical John but here it is
Yes but you said
The gentlemen from the opera are still waiting in the board room sir. Theyre getting a trifle impatient sir.
I wish you luck sir.
Thank heaven.
Nuisance value?
Must we have the echo?
But its a great story. Somewhere in this country a guy is walking into twenty million bucks.
I can understand that.  Well take a walk around town meet you at the train at four oclock.  Congratulations Mr. Deeds. Youre one of the richest men in the country. Well see you later.  Goodbye and thank you.
Look
Okay then. Go to it.  And Charlie
Mr. Deeds are you the son of Dr. Joseph and Mary Deeds?
Mr. Deeds does the name of Martin W. Semple mean anything to you?
I think you ought to give this matter some thought Mr. Deeds.
Sit down. Sure I couldnt get you a glass of lemonade or something?
Well whenever I run across a funny name I always like to poke around for a rhyme. Dont you?
Sounds like a two weeks notice to me.
Youd better get right down there. That opera mob is about to break into the Mad Song from Lucia.2
I cant hold out on you any longer. Lamb bites wolf.  Beautiful.
Well how about tonight? What would you like in the way of entertainment?
What do you think bodyguards are for?
Sometimes its the only solution.
If theyre going to poke fun at me Im going to
You shouldnt be running away like this. Whats going to happen to the Estate?
Now where were we?
my wife wanted me to tell you she  she prays for you every night.
I leave it to you Mr. Deeds. Can you conceive of any court not being in sympathy with any woman who gave up the best years of her life for an old man like your uncle?
Yes sir.
Well what about it Mr. Deeds?
No  I dont want it thank you.
Id like to get in my two cents worth.
Proceed.
Mr. Deeds do you recall forcibly ejecting people from your home?
Mr. Deeds you havent yet touched upon a most important thing. This rather fantastic idea of yours to want to give away your entire fortune. It is to say the least most uncommon.
Anything else Mr. Deeds?
Proceed.
Uhhuh.
Uhhuh.
Well youll not only see those but before the evenings half through youll be leaning against the Leaning Tower of Pisa  youll mount Mt. Everest. Ill show you the Pyramids and all the little Pyramiddes leaping from sphinx to sphinx. Pal how would you like to go on a real oldfashioned binge?
Who are they?
New mouthpiece. Been waiting two weeks for this. Kids keep swiping them all the time. They use em for bean shooters.  What can I do for you gentlemen?
Nice day out  er nice night  wasnt it?  isnt it?
Goodnight. Dont worry. I wont keep her out late.
Tails tonight sir?
What do you think youre doing?
He talks about women as if they were cattle.
Oh. Oh  Has Miss Dawson called yet?
You kept searching me last night sir. Going through my pockets. You said you were looking for a rhyme for Budington.
Madame Pomponi is on the telephone sir.
Hey did you hear that?
Its the kids you know not Jeremy. He had nothing to do with this  except pay of course. Hes always willing to pay. Hes extremely generous.  Im so humiliated that my own children would threaten me.
I know my times up but Ive got to get this out while Ive got hold of it 
You can go out there if you like...
Dr. Mumford.
I know I shoulda come to your office. I was gonna actually but then when you walked in here today...
Thats it  syndrome. So you know all about it?
Hello Mr. Cook. I was wondering if Sofie was around?
Her friend from the city came and took her out to dinner. First time in a long time shes been willing.
Interesting approach. What was his name?
Why not?
Now hold on I didnt say I didnt want to come 
You find it distasteful dont you?
We got divorced.  I had to get rid of her. She couldnt satisfy me.
Let me just say something here... I have no idea if this is going to help.
I didnt see you there. Can I help you?
I think youll like this. Know much about Cuban cigars?
I am. And Im not ashamed of it. Nobody ever said on their death bed  I treated myself too well.
Weve done... very well. You know anything about addiction Doc?
Mr. White I am frustrated that the criminal code in this state allows a maximum sentence of only six months and a maximum fine of only 2000.
Are you disrespecting this court Mr. White?
Meat loaf turkey quesadillas or salad nicoise.
What do you want to know?
They come through a few times each year.  Hello Mrs. Saito good to see you again  Its a tour.
Lily I want you to meet Skip. Skip Lily.
Yes you do you damn well do.
Hello Lionel.
I just got my license two weeks ago.
Whats happening here?
Ph.D. psychologist.
Whatd you want?
Finally some common sense...
I think you know what I mean.
Well... you see the problem is 
Just who is here can you tell me?
When did you start to feel this way?
Moms such a cutie.
Is that the technical description of what Ive got?
There... Ive given myself a real whopper.
Youre doing great.
It doesnt matter. Go on.
That was really bad wasnt it?
Is that when you split up?
Yes And my exhusband  he never accepted me for who I was just like Mother. The things youve said have helped me understand what a dick he is.
Youre shockingly honest thats what makes you great. Ive never had a man treat me this way. With you I feel really... listened to.  Can I tell you something? Its a little embarrassing but I feel very unguarded with you.
Yes somethings very wrong Dr. Mumford.
Is it something youve heard about me?
Im saying that since Im doing so much better  which I attribute to you  Im liable to misinterpret some of my feelings.
You got off easy.
...so he already had the tattoo that said Naomi Forever... and now theyre broken up see and he has to have it removed. But while the scar is still healing or whatever you call it when you have a tattoo removed he meets Chandra. And its serious immediate love. So in no time hes gone from the most gorgeous model in the world to the most gorgeous actress in North America.
Dont do that thing...  ...that shrink thing.
Pro boner?  Pro bono huh? For whose good supposedly?
Where?... The New York Times. The first one was  he handles produce well. Which we already knew  The point is you have a lot of the signs.
These appointments were not my idea remember.
Ive got three big ones.
Skip you must have lots of people you can throw a ball with.
Skip youre the head of the whole deal here. Are they busier than you?
Hell yes I like it. Whats better than this? Most guys would kill just to have someone do this with them whenever they like.
Lives downstairs from me. Shes got a great dog named for Danny Ainge.
So I guess Henry Follett is a patient of yours. Hes my pharmacist.
I want to tell you something Doc but before I do I need to ask you a question... Because for me to tell you this thing  well I havent told anybody about this. Its the biggest secret Ive got.
Sounds like kind of a good idea.
Of course him being insane didnt make it all right that I fell in love with his wife.
Get to know your therapist.
And the drugs?
I know it starts with a birth certificate...
And a birth certificate is enough?
Psych major?
Pretty creepy huh? Are you totally disgusted?
This doesnt seem a little... perverse?
I trained in the east myself  Cornell  and I dont care what anyone says there really are regional differences. I found the state certification exams out here quite harrowing... Did you?
Which examiner did you have? I probably know him.
I told you to leave or die you refused and now you may have killed us all. For you have unleashed the creature that we have feared for more than four thousand years.
And what ritual would that be?
And how does one do that?
What then? Robbery? Extortion? Kidnapping
The Prince does not like to be touched by other humans. A Silly eastern superstition Im afraid.
Then you got no excuse for living. What the hell you doin being buddies with this creep Beni? Whats in it for you?
...and how do you say? Those slimy things in your stomach?
You put up with me because I can read and write ancient Egyptian decipher hieroglyphs and hieratic and Im the only person within a thousand miles who knows how to properly code and catalogue this library.
Im thinking that if the black Book Of The Dead can bring people back to life 
She is like all the others. She will die in the desert.
You think itll send this guy back to hell?
See That proves it Old Setis fortunes gotta be under this sand
Two hundred pounds.
Do you realize we are standing inside a room that no one has entered in over four thousand years.
No?
Could you tell me how to get there? The exact location?
Theres something out there you know something under that sand.
Relax Im the map  Its all up here.
For what?
According to Bembridge Scholars inside the statue of Anubis was a secret compartment perhaps containing The Book Of The Living.
Oh my god Its a preparation room.
A key Thats it Thats what he was talking about.
Seems the Americans had a little misadventure of their own today three of their diggers were killed.
Im going to kiss you Mister OConnell.
According to my readings our friend suffered the HOMDAI the worst of all ancient Egyptian curses one reserved for only the most evil blasphemers. In all of my research Ive never read of this curse actually having been performed.
Yes they never used it because they feared it so. Its written that if a victim of the HOMDAI should ever arise he would bring with him the ten plagues of Egypt.
Having an encounter with a four thousand year old walkingtalking corpse tends to convert one.
No we are not. We woke him up and we must try and stop him.
Its everybodys problem
Thats what I am to you? A contract?
I think you were jealous
Got it
Dont do it Evelyn.
Jonathan?
Two questions. Who the hell is Seti the First? And was he rich?
Ah begging your pardon but shouldnt we be going?
Ummm Hootash im... Hootash im now what is this last symbol here?
That thing gives me the creeps.
Tough break.
He certainly was not a popular fellow when they planted him.
Damnit Thats two down and only two to go.
Okay now what the hell does this Horus guy look like?
I knew youd come. I left that skylight open for you.
I knew youd know.
Umhmm.
Where are you going?
What are you doing all alone in the dark?
Our guests are waiting.
The Bowler? I remember him from when I was a kid. He was killed years ago.
Look honey being a superhero... its a guy thing.
We didnt think this through very well.
Much less go outside.
We could really use some coffee 
Hey do I look like a Man?
And you cant count Horst Buckholtz anyway.
Hey... Can I buy you a beer?
Hows your dad?
Hell never make it.
Have you considered my offer?
I hope you wont take this the wrong way but I couldnt help but notice... that youre a dead ringer for Veronica Lake in The Blue Dahlia.
Me too... I love this stupid old town. Its noisy. Its smelly. Its falling apart.
Ive thought of leaving going to Chicago or New York but...
Im going inside.
Come on guys  were fighting against evil.
Your rage is a very great power but it blinds you to your heart.
Im liking this.
This place is built like a fortress.
GET MAD
Hes Lance Hunt Just take off the glasses  and its him
What does it matter? Women just want to control you  and talk about their feelings. They want to know why youre angry all the time  and what can they can do to help  so you tell them theres nothing  nothing  just leave me alone  but they bug you and they bug you and they bug you  until you just cant stand it anymore  so you finally open up  you pop like a blister  and it all comes spewing out  all your emotions  your feelings  your fears  all of it  And then they dump you.
Maybe shes right.
The Obliterators
Yes Obiewan.
So youre like... struggling superheroes?
So what can I get you?
Its on the television.
I use it... to fight evil.
This is bad.
We may be getting in over our heads here.
Dont crunch the leaves.
Be a Mohican.
Do we have to?
And theres the Sphinx.
But Doc... wheres the machine guns?
Twenty years ago all the major hoodlums of this city were united into one great brotherhood of evil and Casanova was their king.
Weve got lift off
Where am I going?
Your Majesty I have been advised that you have received a letter from Napoleon offering a peace treaty and that you have decided to accept it.
But since the fire a completely new spirit has been aroused in the nation.  The French have become an army of criminals against whom Russia must be avenged against whom she is now prepared to fight to the death.
The point I was trying to make is that I think it is reasonable to say that Your Majesty would not find himself under unbearable pressure if he decided to make peace with the Emperor at least at this time.
I must confess he would look a bit silly fighting his way to Moscow and turning right around again.
Proceed.
Yes Captain?  Have you anything you wish to say?
There are none here.
I believe it was arranged by Marshals Mortier and Marmont.  I must explain to you that we have had no orders all day.  Each marshal has been keeping his own position.
I dont know what has happened to Prince Joseph.
This dispatch has just arrived from Aboukir marked highest priority for General Bonapartes eyes only.
I believe you are acquainted with my brother Joseph Bonaparte and my aide Major Junot.
Was it he who assigned you to command the escort which accompanied Madame Bonapartes coach?
You will return to Paris tomorrow and you will carry my compliments and thanks to General Le Clerc for assigning such an excellent officer to carry out a responsibility which has meant so much to myself and to Madame Bonaparte.
Yes sir?
I havent been there for three years.
How did it spread so quickly?
I told Mortier that he would answer with his life for any looting.
I have met her.  What is your business with me?
A sword is a weapon whatever else you might wish to use it for.
Well then you have a lot of initiative my young friend.
Oh...?
You must be chilled to the bone standing out of doors like this.
No Im only here on leave.  My regiment is at Valence.
No... I have a... room... at the Hotel de Perrin.
She will probably appear with a dozen excuses and you will forgive her anyway.
Oh... how very nice of you to bring that for Eugene... Did General de Beauharnais give it to you?
And now?
Do you expect me to believe that?
Were they pretty?
Were any of them married?
Perhaps  but tell me you promise anyway.
Yes  what is it?
How should I know.  Ask Roquier  hes cleaning her dress.
Yes
But you will not... be safe...
Well he didnt give it to me and when I ask you to do something for me return the work to me not to Berthier.
I must have the breakdown now. Where is Berthier?
Well maybe hes only looking out for your best interests.
You wrote it.
You could hear them?
How did you know it was Captain Charles?
I wanted to kill him but Joseph convinced me it would be a mistake. He said people would say you hadnt the courage to deal with it yourself.
May I inform you monsieur that I am Major Fidon official courier to the court of the Emperor Napoleon on my way to our Embassy at St. Petersburg and in accordance with the rules of the road no one may overtake or pass me.
And where did you see my portrait?
Will I be able to play the harp?  It is an instrument of which I am very fond.
You are so good to me.  Will you also allow me to have a botanical garden?
I hope you have patience with me.  I do not know how to dance the quadrille but if you desire it I will learn.
Has Alexander agreed to this?
What I am talking about is moderation.
Sire you have only enemies in the court of St. Petersburg and I fear outside your influence Alexander will have another look at what he has agreed to.
A revolution is not a polite discussion in a parlor Citizen Lieutenant.  One does not call it murder to kill such vermin.
Citizen Lieutenant my advice is to leave this town at once with your men.  We do not wish to do harm to our brothers in uniform.
Napoleon would soon arouse the resentment of the Directory in Paris exceeding his authority making political decisions and treaties like a Roman Conqueror enlarging his role to ruler of Italy.  Only his tremendous success and ever increasing popularity prevented the Directory from replacing him.
On December 2 1804 Napoleon was made Emperor of France.  He would later say  I found the crown lying in the gutter and I picked it up.
On January 1st 1814 France itself was invaded.  Now with a small army of raw recruits Napoleon would have to face the powerful combination of England Russia Prussia and Austria operating against him together for the first time.  The balance of numbers had tilted irretrievably against him.
Yeah you gotta have a little money to live out here Craig.  I never thought Id be the kinda nigga to move to the suburbs.  But as soon as I got my check I was gone.  Paid 230 thousand dollars cash on this house.

An omelet Arent you living a little above your ration?
Ill tell you later.  That Gurganov you never know whether hes on his way to the washroom or the Secret Police.
An evening gown.

You feel it though.

Which lawyer?
Comrade Buljanoff...
Comrades... Im out of the omelet.

All you have to do is say open sesame.
The former Duchess
Good evening Gaston.

I guess it is eight fortytwo.
I cant follow you Gaston isnt it about time that you realized the unfairness of your position? You being my servant? Wouldnt you like to stand on an equal footing with me?
I want you to know all the White Russian exiles in Paris are keeping their fingers crossed about the jewels. They are very interested in the case. Swana suspects her countrymen.
Youre looking magnificent Leon...  ...isnt he General Savitzky?
Good evening Your Highness.
Certainly Your Highness this way please... Count dAlgout made the reservation this afternoon.
Is this satisfactory?
They tell me it has a wonderful restaurant on the second floor.
Lets do that.
...des petites fraises des bois... de la crme de Bretagne... 
If you want to see us you must come later.
And if we have to go to Siberia...
You found your way to us and we werent easy to reach were we?
Do you know how much a cow costs Comrade Iranoff?
Well it means another two weeks in Paris.
Come now you must not talk that way.... You have to adjust yourselves.... We must be brave.
But Buljanoff Iranoff Kopalski...
...we have a wonderful electric sign Dine With Buljanof Iranoff and Kopalski.
Yes monsieur?
I might be able to accommodate you. Is there some more luggage?
Im afraid we have no boxes of that size in our vault but there is one suite with a private safe...
We may have a chance.
We cannot feed the Russian people on your intentions. Fifty per cent to a socalled Duchess... Half of every loaf of bread to our enemy Comrade Kopalski go at once to our Embassy and get the address of the best lawyer in Paris.
If there is anything we can do for you...
And your own gas cooker? Thats marvelous  Naturally its not the Royal Suite...
Now comrades... there is something better in life than crumbs of French pastry.
Dont hold that against me... please
Private.
Listen I want to be absolutely frank with you. I have no business in Moscow.
Thats impossible Nobody has the right.... You cant do that... If you dont give me that visa...
Now look here... you advertise all over the world that you want people to go into your country and when someone tries to get in you keep him out
You please.
Thank you.
Can I help you?
I am interested only in the shortest distance between these two points. Must you flirt?
You gave me some very valuable information. Thank you.
Then you dont want me to go there.
Good evening comrade.  This man is horribly old. You should not make him work.
I will start with you.
Dont do it please.
Pardon me for addressing you but you insulted him you know that. You hurt his feelings. It was just like telling a musician you dont like music. That good old man believes in food as you believe in Karl Marx. You cant go around hurting people Comrade Yakushova but maybe you can make it up to him. Do you know how?  By eating everything with relish by drinking everything with gusto by having a good time for the first time in your natural life
Oh Ninotchka who wants to talk business. If you win the suit fine. If we win the suit better. You do me an injustice.  When we went to my apartment did I have the slightest idea that you had any connection with this deal?
Will you smile?
On which boat?
I suppose you dont think thats funny?
Ill tell you that joke again. A man comes into a restaurant. Did you get that?
I suppose she is very entertaining... It must be lots of fun to be with her so witty so glamorous...
How do you do?
Quickly please... tell me one of your funny stories.
Go on.
Comrades Comrades
Not white darling.
And we wont stretch up our arms...
...and we wont clench our fist...
Would that make you any happier?
No music.
Hello Leon
Did you win?
Was it for this that I refused to endorse Dr. Bertrands Mouthwash? I could have made a little fortune by saying that the Vincent Vacuum Cleaner was the only vacuum cleaner ever used by the Romanoffs... and now you want them to smear my lifes secrets over the front page of a tabloid?
You havent seen her yet?
That proletarian In the old days wed have had her flogged.
Imagine the carpets of a self respecting Parisian hotel dirtied by the boots of a muzhik What does she look like?
Thank you.
Yes Swana you did.
Yes Swana.
Leon darling how nice Have you ordered tea or a cocktail?
Say it over and over again Leon. Words are a wonderful safety valve and thats what you need  because you know its impossible dont you?
Hello Leon darling
Now please Swana.
I just dropped in to have a little hearttoheart talk with you.
You leave me no choice.
Well Comrade have you heard from your friends Kopalski Buljanoff and Iranoff?
You want me to go to Constantinople?
I appreciate the confidence you show in me but I must ask you to entrust someone else with this mission. I should hate to interrupt my present work. I am positive that my survey is more important than finding out whether three of our comrades have been drinking some extra glasses of champagne.
Its just a place for workmen.
Your Highness forgive this intrusion but...
Sir the charges are serious  first abuse of power second obstruction of justice third failure to cooperate with Congress and last bombing Cambodia ...
Well see about that ...
How much do you need?
I agree its ridiculous but 
You want me to put it all in writing? Over my signature?
The President would like to know if that was the last payment.
Is it?
To protect his people.
Lets not forget theyre just kids they dont vote.
Sure they did stuff but nothing like this Bob.  Forget Watergate the breakins the Enemies list.  You got an attempted firebombing at the Brookings Institution planting McGovern stuff on the guy that shot Wallace trying to slip LSD to Jack Anderson.
Colson doesnt know about it hes pure as a virgin on this one.  Its just not clear the burglars knew what they were looking for.  They were heading to McGoverns office later that night.
Marthas an idiot shell do anything to get Johns attention.  If Mitchelld been minding the store instead of that nut Martha we wouldnt have that kid Magruder runnin some thirdrate burglary  Was he smoking pot?
McCord? ...
I dont have time for all this shit  Just handle it Bob  Keep it out of the White House.  What else? Kissingers waiting  hes gonna throw a tantrum again if I dont see him threatening to quit ... again. 
We cant touch Hoover 
The countrys loving it.
I end the longest war in American history and they keep harping on this chickenshit  You know whos behind this dont you  its Teddy Kennedy He drowns a broad in his car and he cant run for president.
Let em try  I appointed three of those bastards  Im not giving em my tapes
Who the fuck does Cox think he is?  I never made a dime from public office  Im honest.  My dad died broke.  You know the sonofabitch went to law school with Jack Kennedy? ... The last gasp of the Establishment They got the hell kicked out of em in the election so now they gotta squeal about Watergate cause we were the first real threat to them in years. And by God Al we would have changed it changed it so they couldnt have changed it back in a hundred years if only ...
June twentythird 72 sir.  The part thats underlined.  Your instructions to Haldeman regarding the CIA and the FBI.
We cant survive this sir.  They also have you instructing Dean to make the payoff to Hunt.
Sir you talked about opening up the whole Bay of Pigs thing again.
He works for Colson.  He used him on the Pentagon Papers.  Were trying to figure out when he officially stopped being a White House consultant.  After the arrest he dumped his wiretapping stuff into his White House safe.
Well why not?
Bob did I approve the Ellsberg thing? You know Im glad we tape all these conversations because ... I never approved that breakin at Ellsbergs psychiatrist.  Or maybe I approved it after the fact?  Someday weve got to start transcribing the tapes.
Play it tough.  Thats the way they play it and thats the way were going to play it.  Dont lie to Helms and say theres no involvement but just say this is sort of a comedy of errors bizarre without getting into it.  Say the President believes its going to open up the whole Bay of Pigs thing again.  Tell Helms he should call the FBI call Pat Gray and say that we wish for the sake of the country  dont go any further into this hankypanky period
Just do what I say Bob.
Christ youre right  Gray makes Jerry Ford look like Mozart.  Just have Helms call him.  Helms can scare anybody.
Its got nothing to do with justice. Its national security.
... When we consider the lineup of the world we find there are 590 million people on our side 800 million on the Communist side and 600 million who are neutral.  The odds are 5 to 3 against us ...
I think ... I think ... thats the sort of very dangerous and irresponsible suggestion that ... helping the Cuban exiles who oppose Castro would uh ... not only be a violation of international law it would be ...
I dont understand.  Track 2s Chile?
The first assassination attempt was in 60 just before the election.
He didnt veto it.  I ran the White House side.  The mob contact was Johnny Roselli.  One of the CIA guys was that jackass Howard Hunt.
... and weve got the economic guys at five.  The Dow lost another 16 points. Theyre going to want a decision on the budget.  Sir?  ... Are we holding the line on a balanced budget?
I see ... Well then Richard we have nothing more to talk about do we?
Whatd he say?
Whatd you say?
Mom expects great things from you ...
Im honored Dick that youve come all this way out here to Virginia to visit us at last.
Of course weve tried but so far weve come up with nothing that ...
Im sure you realize this is a very tricky area Mr. President given our charter and the congressional oversight committees ...
Not if I give you all the cards ...
And of course I accept.  Im flattered.  And I want you to know I work for only one president at a time.
CIA policy?  The CIA has no policy Mr. Helms.  Except what I dictate to you ...  I try to adjust to the world as it is today not as you or I wanted it to be ten years ago.
No.
Ummm...
Roselli?  Johnny Roselli?
The little bastards think they can ruin Tricias wedding day by dancing naked in the Reflecting Pond.
Yeah you do.  Id be bugging myself Edgar ... Whod get the tapes?
Who we working for?
Whered you find him?
So does Tricky Dick know about this?
Mein Kampf?
So whats this about Dick?
It looks like to me were gonna lose the war for the first goddamned time and Dick goddamn it youre going along with it buying into this Kissinger bullshit  detente with the Communists.  Detente  it sounds like two fags dancing.
Fuck it  He doesnt like me John  Its your fault Henry.
Housecleaning?  It would be ugly Henry really ugly ...
... Uh I hope this doesnt embarrass you.
Do you miss Cuba Manolo?
You know I voted for you in your last election.
Rockys full of shit  No way hes going to get nominated west of the Hudson with a new wife.  Hes gonna be drinking Scotches in retirement at some goddamn country club with the rest of the Republicans.
Uh wait ...
Jesus Christ
Hi Im Dick Nixon.
The Orangemen  Now theres a football program.  Jim Brown.  And that other tailback ... The one with the blood disease ...
... I dont really know you yet Sandy ... What do you like?  I mean what kind of clothes do you like?  Do you like blue ... red?
Yeah ... Guy Lombardo ...
... but it depends on what Im doing to the music Dick ...
Someone wants it ...  You cant stop it can you?  Even if you wanted to.  Because its not you. Its the system.  And the system wont let you stop it ...
We got the press this time
We gotta make em think were just as tough as they are  that Nixons a mad bomber he might do anything  I played a lot of poker in World War II  and I won big and let me tell you this  unpredictability is our best asset.  That redneck Johnson left me with a shitty hand and Im bluffing.  Ive got to play the hawk in Vietnam and the dove in China. And if we keep our heads we can win this thing.
But what am I telling the press about Kent State?
No they want you Mr. President.  I really think it would be a good move.
You know Fred they sell tickets.
We lost ...
We dont have to put ourselves through this again Dick.
Amen to that.
What are you saying?  What are you talking about?
Ill do it.  No more.
Were you planning to tell me?
Youre the strongest woman I ever met. I love you Buddy.
Yeah sure a long time ago.
Yes  This is about me.  Why cant you understand that you of all people? Its not the war  its Nixon  They want to destroy Nixon  And if I expose myself even the slightest bit theyll tear my insides out.  Do you want that?  Do you want to see that Buddy?  Its not pretty.
No I dont.  Im not Jack ...
Yes.
What exactly did you want to discuss Pat?
I remember Alger Hiss.  I know how ugly you can be  youre capable of anything.  But you see it doesnt really matter at the end of the day whats on them.  Because you have absolutely no remorse.  No concept of remorse.  You want the tapes to get out you want them to see you at your worst ...
Won or lost?
But being out of the game gives me time to write.
What?
Well in any case Rocky Ill send you my book.  Six Crises.
Howd you know I was here.
You heard my  you havin fun with me?
How many a those things you got now?
What would you a done if hed been released?
...Your granddad never asked me to sign on as deputy. I done that my own self. Loretta says youre quittin.
How comere you doin that?
Nineteen zero and nine.
I thought maybe she was with your boy there.
Signs and wonders. But I think once you stop hearin sir and madam the rest is soon to follow.
He is just a goddamn homicidal lunatic Ed Tom.
Yes maam?

Thats the boy.
Sheriff thats aggravating.
Hows that Sheriff?
Yessir.

What business is it of yours where Im from friendo?
...Will there be somethin else?
Is somethin wrong?
With anything?
You dont know what youre talking about do you?
...Whats the most youve ever lost on a coin toss?
Yes.
You need to call it. I cant call it for you. It wouldnt be fair. It wouldnt even be right.
Twelve gauge. You need shells? Moss looks the gun over.
What kind of tent?
You get a lot of people come in here with no clothes on?
Dont stop. Just ride me up past the rooms.
November the 28th last year.

The heroin. You dont have it.
...Im across the river. At the Hotel Eagle. Carson Wells.  Call me when youve had enough. I can even let you keep a little of the money.
No no. No. You dont understand. You cant make a deal with him. Even if you gave him the money hed still kill you. Hes a peculiar man. You could even say that he has principles. Principles that transcend money or drugs or anything like that. Hes not like you. Hes not even like me.
Are you in the service?
Hey Sheriff. Hows everything?
Im in a motel. Has something happened to Del? Did he do something stupid?
Ahh whatd you do now... fall off your bike again?
It wasnt a woman.
I dunno. Job satisfaction I guess...  Hows things at the Tip Top?
You must be joking.
...well if youre not going to slit my throat whyd you come up here?
Wait. Let me get this out.  I like the symphony walks in the rain sunsets animals and children. I read passionately and I like to discuss things. Im basically conservative but flexible. Ive been involved in the death of thirty two people but I can live with that because the world is lighter by thirty two pieces of shit excuse my language.
I thought you were a garbageman of humanity or something.
If we went out that window right now wed have a chance...
Betty I dont wanna shrivel up alone in some stinking prison. No way. Ive got some professional pride. And I dont want anybody else to get the credit for taking me out.
So all this... really was because of that soap opera? My son is dead because you came out here to be with that doctor? A fake doctor?
You can start tomorrow. And dont say a word about this to anyone.  Is that issue?
The LeSabre
Oh I wish we could just get in it and drive and drive and drive
Tell Del Im sorry. I left so quick but I need to do this.
I gotta go.
...of course you do.  You dont remember me?
Right Del. Del was one hot salesman. Of cars. He could talk anyone into anything.
Yeah I felt that way too when I first started but now... the hours the repetition... its not all glamour and mall openings anymore. Maybe I shouldve listened to my people and tried to make the crossover to nights earlier I dont know...  ...I just hope its not too late for me. God Listen to me Me me me. Its so easy to get caught up in the whole ego cycle of this business and make it all about yourself. Stop right? Thats it no more about me tonight I promise... Lets talk about you... what do you think about me? Im kidding... Seriously Betty Im doing all the talking here...
Thanks. But Id like to hear what youre feeling...
But Im David... I mean Im not David but she thinks I am You heard her...  Stop staring at me... Im not crazy she is
Thanks...
Oh youre there. You sound out of breath.

Youre in serious danger
Whats the matter here?
Shut up Merle... Williams.
Where you headed Betty?

Oh. I mean except for that.  Yep. Im trading in a car dealer for a heart specialist so thats pretty good...
How did you know?
Well David moved out here and started his residency. Then he met Leslie 
Okay... oh umm would you mind if I borrowed some clothes?
Fuck the details theyre always to blame... Look too many of these guys duck out on us especially after they become doctors or lawyers. I see it at my company all day long So Im just gonna make sure you get your you know fairy tale ending or whatever...  One of us should.
Jesus Theyre all gonna be calling me
IM TALKING ABOUT DAVID RAVELL
Whyd you help me in the first place?
Im not going back on our arrangement. My word is good and my family owes you. But I think its best for both of us if you get your own place as soon as you can.
What are those for?
You should have a little faith in people.
These guys are here to help you Betty.
Im not some snotnosed resident fresh out of medical school Blake.
Really. And where was that old man?
...you can have the best damn running backs in the world somebodys still gotta block for em.
All right gentlemen lets get down to it. I need to know if youre for real.
Im asking you for an example of one of these dumb fucks being a dumb fuck.
Oh Jesus please... Please God.
Thats right.
That is so right.
Now thats really stupid.
Im all for them owning casinos getting rich off the white mans greed. Its a beautiful piece of irony isnt it Wesley?
This is great  just great Now we dont know where the goddamn stuff is.
We can live with that.
So how do we know that cars still in Fair Oaks?
Every American should see the Grand Canyon. Are you an American?
Thats good. Youre learning. But let me tell you why I know she was lying.  First off Betty would never fall for a soap star. Its beneath her.
Cause I just dont buy it. Call it instinct. Call it 35 years of professional knowhow...
What in the...  What the hell is this? Youve been holding out on me. All this fucking time
Thank you for your cooperation.  Just one more thing... did she ever talk about getting rich?

Dont I know it. Come on in Agent Rodgers. Sit down. Always a... pleasure to see you. How can I be of help?
Now hold on Rodgers...
I want it duly noted that this operation was entirely under the auspices of the Oakland Police Department. The FBI doesnt have a monopoly on agents infiltrating enemy organizations my friend. As Ive said before Agent Rodgers we have things under control in our city...
These are memos from the commissioner the mayor and Hoover himself putting the Black Panthers and their subversive activities under the full jurisdiction of the Bureau.
The time my friend is what Sartre called the moment the match is being put to the fuse. Question is is the hand holding that match gonna be black or white.
Shit nothing but Paper Panthers.
Cmon lets...

Man this shits pretty thick.
I dont know man. I dont know. That reminds me.  Another little donation from the police.
Yeah well they want a lot for their money. They want a felony preferably with violent intent. Weve got to give them something. Theyll kill me if I dont. And the Panthers are going to kill me if I do. Im scared.
I thought you said all the Panthers were gonna be here.
Busted firing pin.  You want only the legal stuff right?
You got something on your mind... brother.
Fuck is up?
The pigs are gonna start flooding us with dope. Huey wants us to stop them.
Chickenshits? What you bring your buddies with you?
You supposed to be a wounded vet Motherfucka. What you do in Nam anyway shoot gooks or shoot hoops?
My Moms at that.
Judge... I... I shoulda told you this before but... well... fuck...
God damn its him. I gotta go.
Yeah... cop hit me...
I hear them boys those Black Panthers theyre communists. They dont even believe in God.
You believe that?
Congratulations.
Maybe well be lucky this winter and have just rain no snow.
You expect to hold Cornwallis with militia?
Well?
He reminds me of you before you got old and ugly.
You dont know him very well do you?
I know him well enough?
You got salt last week.
And send us to war alongside Massachusetts.
Of course I do.
Goodbye Charlotte.
Please forgive me for keeping you waiting.
Thank you.
Very well let us move on to...
I do have eighteen criminals under sentence of death but I hold no prisonersofwar.
My harrier.  Join us Colonel.
What news?
Father Ive lost respect for you. I thought you were a man of principle.
Father...
How old are you?
We buried them then we went to track.  It was a cold trail and they were moving fast.  We went faster. We caught up to them at Kentucky Ford.
An American nation.  Colonel Lee with your permission?
Those of us who call ourselves Patriots are not seeking to give birth to an American nation but to protect one that already exists.  It was born a hundredandseventy years ago at Jamestown Virginia and has grown stronger and more mature with every generation reared and with every crop sown and harvested.  We are a nation and our rights as citizens of that nation are threatened by a tyrant three thousand miles away.
Damn it Francis  How in Gods name do you expect to gain independence without going to war?
And Patriots will start dying on the gallows instead of the battlefield.  Unless we can keep Cornwallis in the South until the French arrive.  A treaty was signed at Versailles after our victory at Saratoga.  The French are sending a fleet and ten thousand troops.
The bigger problem is where not when.  The French fleet wont sail north of the Chesapeake for fear of early storms.
Not me you.  Im going north with every Continental regular I can find to reinforce Washington or he wont last six weeks.
Theyd be better off but the cause wouldnt be.
Goodbye Francis.
How far away?
Reverend.
Its a good measure of a woman that shell have her honeymoon under the stars.
Colonel let us help his soul find its place with the Almighty and...
Seventeen.
Father?
Father you cant let them take him...
Do you know what this place is Ellie? Oh I know you know its a boneyard but a bone aint nothing and even a whole pile of em dont amount to much. Do you know what a graveyard really is?
Honey Church will be fine.
Hurrts It hurrrrts
NoI guess not.
And that someone cared enough about that animal to mark the spot.
Shes in bed. She was throwing up. Ever since Mrs. Rogers called and said Missy
At school Michael McDowell said she was gonna fry in hell. Michael McDowell says all sewersides fry in hell.
I dont know honey. Different people believe all sorts of different things happen to us when we die. Some believe in heaven or hell. Some think were born again as little children
Well its actually reincarnation but you get the idea. And some people think we just wink out...like a candle flame when the wind blows hard.
I think we go on. Im not sure what happens after we die but yeah I have faith in that.
Excuse me Mr. CrandallIve got to change this kid. Its nice to meet you.
Was it Pascow?
The one that goes into the woodssure.
Who owns the woods up ahead? Paper companies?
Its Church.
Bagged cat. What a mess.
No need to apologize.
But
What do you mean?
We cant climb over that. Well break our necks
You want to rest a bit before you start?
Doesnt look like they last long.
But
I most generally dont start before noon but this looks like an exception.
You and this old Indian ragman
Ill bitewhats the bottom of the truth Jud?
Please I want to wake up. Leave me alone. Its not my fault you died you were as good as dead when they brought you in
Ill tell you where the ground is sourthe ground in my heart is sour. Let me tell you something else Vicbaby Wrong is wrong.
And Buckaroo Banzai.
Gages gone
Thank you. Thank you so much.
and youll end up doing a free consultation on his arthritis or urinary problems and
It was that place. That creepy cemetery up in the woods. Whatever disease the kids in this town have got I dont want Ellie to catch it.
I heard you tonight.
Im going to try to do better.
You better get going hon.
AnaMaria trim the mainsail
I know whose blood you need to end the curse.
Blast you  Ill throw you in prison.
Ill watch my back.
No I really think I do.
Like after youve killed ... Every ... Last ... One ... of Norringtons men.
Thats proper sir according to the code.
I am disinclined to acquiesce to your request.  Means No.
You have a name missy?
And how does a maid come to own a trinket such as that?  A family heirloom perhaps?
Agreed.  You have my word as a gentleman of fortune 
I think it would be rather exciting to meet a pirate.
Man overboard
Youre speaking up for him again?
Commodore I beg you  please do this ... for me.  As a wedding gift.
Actually I find it all fascinating.
Its  beautiful. May I inquire as to the occasion?
I could never forget it Miss Swann.
Why would my father send this to me?
It doesnt
You are despicable.
Has it changed since the last time you were here?
Captain Sparrow  We have to get off this island  immediately
Jack its a fools errand Youve heard the tales they tell about the Pearl.
We can at least fight  we might be able to kill a few
All the men in place sir.  Ready to fire.
Dead serious.
Agreed.  You have the momentary advantage sir.  But I will see you smile from the yard arm sir.
This dock is offlimits to civilians.
Whats your name?
Move
Where does it make berth?
The ships real enough.  So its anchorage must be a real place. Where is it?
Why are brothering with that?
Everybody stay calm.  Were taking over the ship
For a man whose made an industry of avoiding boats youre a quick study.
Put it away Will.  Its not worth getting beat again.
But I survived.  And I still have that single shot.  Its meant for one man.  My mutinous first mate
Whats that?
Jack
Theres no real ship as can match the Interceptor.
He may be.
That Jack Sparrow ... he talked about the Black Pearl.
Has my daughter given you an answer yet?
Mr. Sim when you do locate him.  Do not scare him off again.  Just watch him.  I think you can handle that. Right Mr. Sim?
Dr. Argon everythings starting to come apart here.  You hired me to take care of these matters of security and I am trying but elements are making my job impossible.
The body is just another part of nature and ever since we gave up trees for central air there has been nothing sacred about nature. Nature is the enemy Mr. OBrien and science is our greatest weapon against her.
It remains to be seen who is the good guy and who is the bad guy. History is written by the victor.
Shes working as fast as she can Icarus.  It will be ready soon.
It works Poppy.  It works it works
Yes thats true.  We have to find him run tests determine if the polymerization is stable.
Oh no.  No.  Well get her assistant.  Whatshisname? Nebbishman?
Look at me Icarus  Look at my body.  Ive done everything changed anything you asked me to.  We will always love most that which we create.  Is that still true?
Then you still love me?
She could have given him something to stimulate his kidneys.
Theyre here  Theyre here  We have the nanobot.
Here kid this is great stuff.  Why dont you give it a try?
Hawhaw  Why dont you run off and find a cop and Ill wait right here.
Yeah.  I knew him when I was still in school.
Of course sir.
I dont believe this is happening...
Is that what Argon told you?
Susan
Really?  What have you been doing?
Somebody has to.
But youve polymerized singlecelled bacteria and the fruit flies I know you have.
The nanobot combined your molecules with the plastic molecules in the white assembler fluid so that on a molecular level you now have more in common with a Good Year tire than a human being.
The problem is the byproduct created by the process.
So right now theres little replicators spreading throughout Argons lab?
Lungs sound fine.  You didnt have any preexisting physical conditions did you?  Allergies? Infections?
Is something wrong?
You have no one to blame but yourself.
Do you have something to bring me down?
I could go with you.
No cheese.
Thats pretty good.
Thats going to fit me?
You made this out of my hair?
Argons private lab.
You saved my life.
Weve got to get the nanobot.
Things do change.
What?  Im not going anywhere
Oh yeah hes alive.  Technically.
Under the circumstances I cant fathom what makes Dr. Argon think we are ready for anything bigger.  If C.N.N. or hell if the E.P.A. knew what was in my basement 
If you dont have any questions Ill let you get back to doing your job.
Okay Barbie lets get this over with.
It might be paranoia but Ive never lost my keycard before.
In fact would it be safe to say based on your general knowledge of this character that he is already in the building?
Exactly.
Miss Wilson will give you the guest list and any other details you may need Miss Gallagher.
Im sure youre quite willing to be decent about this.
I suppose youre going to print them?
I dont know how to thank you. Motherll be so grateful  shell probably want to kiss you.
Your place?
Look Anne youre not serious about this are you?
Do you like them?
You wear them of course silly.
Oh yes you will my dear  oh yes you will my dear  youll eat spinach but youll wear garters too
Oh yes of course. How do you do?
No? What do you look upon her as?
That was kind of a rotten thing to do Anne. After all Gallagher is my friend. The least you can do is be courteous to her.
Is this true Stewart? Did you really say it?
Im not going
Go downstairs and tell them  anything. Tell them Im not going. Tell them Im not home.
Think of the fun we can have  well sneak down the back stairs and get in the valets Ford. Hows that?
Ill tell you what lets do  Ill take you and introduce you to all my gang. Would you like that?
Now wait a minute. Arent you being a little unreasonable?
Now wait dont get excited Anne. Theres no reason for that. Perhaps the boys have had a little too much to drink. Thats all right. Im sorry. Ill go right down and throw them out. Thats no reason for you to take this attitude. After all I certainly have a right to invite a few of my friends to my house havent I?
This is something I should have done a long time ago only I didnt have sense enough to do it. No I had to stick around here to try and make a success of something that I knew darn well was a failure from the very beginning. But no more. No more So thats that.
Oh the usual thing. Blah blah blah attended the blah blah reception and wore the same blah blah things.
Ahahah
Hello there Meadows13
Fine. Have a seat.
Yale 21 I believe.
Yeah
Impossible. Put it on again.
Would you like to have me turn around for you Bingy?

Thanks thanks.
My error.
Dont pay attention to him Stew. He doesnt know what hes talking about.
Mr. Smith Ive read some of your plays and Id like an autograph.
Well Ill have to look someplace else.
Well youre not getting your play done but youre certainly covering a lot of territory.
Oh sure. Shed make a beautiful heroine...
Now weve got it right up to where the boys wearing his white spats and going to teas and the frau enters  hows that?
Never mind that. If you cant get my breakfast ready  and cant get here on time in the morning  then you can go get yourself another job.
Thanks. May I sit down?
Anne asked me to come and see you about the divorce.
Some bicarbonate  quick
Heavens The mans insane
Shhh Do you hear something?
Smythe I mean  when youre alone and want to amuse yourself then what?

Bud Parker and William Johnson you have been charged with desecration of a public building and the intentional use of prohibited paint colors in violation of the Pleasantville Code of Conduct and laws of common decency. Do you admit that on the night of May 1 you did consciously and willfully apply the following FORBIDDEN colors to the Pleasantville Town Hall  Red Pink Vermillion Puce Chartreuse Umber Blue Aqua Ox Blood Green Peach Crimson Yellow Olive and Magenta.
I think Ive got something to say.
What do you mean?
You put handcuffs on them and you take them to the police station.
Hear your Dad got a new car.
No not that hedge. The other one.
God David. Just give it to me
Noooooo
Okay now you listen to me I dont know whats going on but youd better fix it I had a date with Mark Davis and I even bought new UNDERWEAR
I looked in the library. They got covers with nothing inside them.
Hello? Ive got like three pounds of underwire here ...
Theyre happy like this.
David let me tell you something. These people dont want to be geeks. They want to be attractive. Theyve got a lot of potential they just dont know any better.
Are you sure?
I baked you my oatmeal cookies.
No. I baked them for you.
Um ... You gotta turn off Main Street.
Mmmmgh.
Yeah ... I guess.  I dont know.

Because youre coming home. Im gonna put this place back the way it was.

I dont know what went wrong. You answered every question. You knew every detail. The senior Prom ... McIntires Department Store. We had all the same warm memories Sock hops. The Church Social ...
You know if this ever happens again you can make the fries even if I havent put out the napkins yet.
Well usually I put out the burger and then you finish with the lettuce ...
Bud ...
Look. I thought we talked about this I thought we said ...
TV repair.

Told you it was your lucky day. Bet you thought I was just a fan or something.
Dream come true hunh?
Oh GOD ...
Well I cant talk though

Well yeah thank you but

 Im probably not gonna go though.
This is funny.
Who is it?
So that pudding was bought I bought that pudding because of a pretty interesting promotion thats sponsored by Healthy Choice and American Airlines. Its designed to encourage airline travel and obviously designed to encourage buying Healthy Choice products. They make frozen meals deli meats pasta sauce breads soups and ice creams this sort of thing.....

Thats fine. Can I have a telephone number area code first on where we can call you back?

Each pudding cup has to be scanned individually so that...its for a giveaway...a product giveaway by this company...
Im just talking on the phone to you and standing.
Ok.

Hello?
What did you say?
Ill go pay for my car.
Yeah.
So Ill meet you at the restaraunt?
One day Fanchons first client was a surgeon. He ran his fingers across her naked skin pulling apart folds of flesh inspecting each and every follicle...
In part yes.
Madeleine I... there are certain things... feelings... we must not voice.
Dont come back not tonight not again 
If youd grant me a final favor Id like the chance to explain myself 
I must grant him his last rites.
Im entertaining you now arent I?
Its a fiction not a moral treatise.
Its that Doctor fellow isnt it? Hes come to usurp your place here hasnt he?
Ill die of loneliness Ive no company but the characters I create 
Thats a Turkish weave you numbskull it costs more than youll earn in your lifetime 
Its a potent aphrodisiac isnt it? Power over another man.
Its no secret that you loved her.
Dont confuse one organ with another 
Go to hell
NEVER
I FUCKED HER COUNTLESS TIMES IN EVERY ORIFICE AND ALL THE WHILE SHE PLEAD FOR MORE 
If you dont mind my asking... why has the Emperor taken such sudden interest in my... our... affairs?
I understand he practices the very crimes he preaches in his fiction.
Hes made a great success of our Little Theater theres seldom an empty seat. Not to mention its therapeutic value.
Ive taken vows to live my life within these walls not outside them.
Youre a sentimental man.
And ?
I have.
You ought to be ashamed Abbe. Exploiting those drooling pathetic cretins for financial gain 
Youll get more from her with kindness than you will with force.
As for the author... shoot him.
Charenton? The administrator there is quite wellloved is he not?
Here it is the last chapter.
Ill plunder every lovely pore until youre week and cry no more
The vigor with which he made love caused her bones to dislodge. Still he granted her the highest compliment he accorded any woman...
Youre more than a priest youre an angel Aint he Maddy?
Im hungry for a proper visit.
If only these coins purchased your other talents too.
Its a long story this one.
I beg to differ Doctor. You work in a madhouse. Your every waking moment is governed by the insane.
I assume youve come to plead for clemency on your husbands behalf.
Youre aware are you not that it costs a great deal to house your husband at Charenton...
But youve a pension havent you from the sale of his books?
I am eternally in your debt.
Doctor... Can I impart to you his cruelest trick?
This is neither the time nor the place 
Public scorn carries a terrible sting. Trust me. Im a woman who knows.
How was I to know my darling?
Tell me have you done anything to secure my release? NO Have you petitioned the court? NEVER Sought audience with the Emperor 
So you ever gonna do a picture?
That poor woman.
And we would hear them scuttling around at night with their little red eyes and little yellow tt teeth and Im just imagining plague lice jumpin all over the damn place So we set tttraps everywhere. And every morning we would find the tttraps sprung but no mice
Thats why he has the parties he says its like bringing the world to me.
Listen you come down and stay with us for a few days. Just tell the old man that
When I met him I was just 20. And he was 55. I saw the gold ring and just grabbed on. And he was going to make me a star.
How does one get 125 million dollars in debt?
Then you explain it to me?
I just want to understand
Youre not going to get another chance boy Look right at the monster and you tell him
love them so much that they ought to love you back. Only you want love on your own terms. 
Tome its a question of truth and illusion. Dont you get tired of the errant falsity in motion pictures?
Now Orson you know Im just dyin to see your picture and I know its gonna be boffo but youre writing about a publisher right?
We find the man and then we dissect him
Howard Hughes killed Jean Harlow?
Look at those hands. Those are the hands of an artist. A modern Caravaggio.
In Xanadu did Kubla Khan a stately pleasure dome decree. . . How big is it all told? The estate?
Oh Christ...
Howard Hughes he would just kill us. Hearst he would kill us and fuck everything we ever loved.
Where did he go? He hasnt had a screen credit in four years
Hell destroy us.
What?
Cain  like the Bible guy?
And Im looking at them  and theyre all looking at me and I dont know who should pour the tea. 
I want you back
No but I can imagine. What am I today? A puny upstart or a spoiled dilettante  no she wouldnt know how to spell that
This is just the first shot. Maestro. Sooner or later shes gonna use the word. And all those boys know that there is only one thing this country hates more than the coloreds and thats the Jews.
You know all this nightmare we went through with Hearst. The whole thing... And in the end probably no one will ever remember the picture anyway.
Very generous
Youre going to destroy it
Its an awful title of course but I cant think of anything better. Someone came up with A SEA OF UPTURNED FACES  which has a nice grand ring to it  and I thought of JOHN CITIZEN USA but that strikes me as a bit Warner Brothers. Or God forbid Capraesque. I suppose AMERICAN will do for now but
Pardon?
A Z and a K in the title. That would draw the eye. For the poster. I like that THE PRISONER OF ZENDA had a Z and a P and that worked
Do WAR OF THE WORLDS as a feature and everyones happy. You make some money and New Yorks happy and you have a track record and then well move on to KANE.
I think you better sit down
You know something Orson you havent done anything but lie to me from the moment we met. But ya know Id do it again in a second.
Its just not low enough. This is the scene. We have to look up at these two man as pillars soaring to the sky. As towering virtues in combat
Oh no
You want to do the life of Jesus?
What is it with you? Cant you talk? You got like a funny attitude. I cant figure you out Joey. Whats with you and the quick answers? You wanna get outa here fast?
Hes an embarrassment because Frankie and the other guys are expectin me to do something about it and Im lookin very bad. I cant deliver a kid from my own neighborhood. Whys he make it so hard on himself? He comes to me I can make it easier for him.
Whats up Colonel?
Im gonna kill him. That fuckin jigs gonna wish he never came outa the jungle. You got any money?
J.R. glad you could make it.
You know?
Cmon Jack. You had a few drinks.
Yeah 
Go head.
Nah she dont go with nobody. Shes only 15 years old.
Probably. You know she talks to everybody and not just him.
Ah some piece of ass Im tellin you.
You want us to wait for you?
Say what youre gonna say.
Say what you gotta say. Dont be a smart ass.
Whatcha doin?
Maybe shes afraid youre gonna hit her so she cant talk to you the way she wants to.
See? Thats all there was to it.
Except fall down like a normal person.
So eat just a little. You gotta eat something.
Hows that?
You know when you gave him a beatin.
Didnt it have nothin to do with me?
What?
You givin me that look. I gotta accept your word but if I find out anythin Im gonna kill somebody...
Did you ever fuck my wife?
Im pulling out of next Wednesdays TV bout cause I cant make the weight. Im fighting at light heavyweight and I still cant make the weight.
He aint hurting me but I cant get him down.
You go first. Let me watch how to do this.
I cant find my ball.
Can you see it?
Are you sure we should be doing this?
You said I couldnt. Youve been good for two weeks...
Dont tell me No. I saw you lookin at him. Why you like him?
In other words youre not interested in him but youd be interested in somebody else right?
You dont kiss like that. Hello and goodbye thats all you do.
You know if theres one thing  I just dont understand you not one single little bit. You love me?
I dunno.
Vickie open up. I need to come in.
Cant you get the money from your friends?
How you feelin? Ok? You feelin good?
Salvy would I steer you wrong? Lets say thats the truck its full of cigarettes right? Now two oclock this morning we move the truck from here to there  take the cigarettes out sell em make some cash.
Talk some sense into him will ya? Youre still his brother. If he aint gonna listen to you he aint gonna listen to nobody
No youre his wife.
And youre drinking with them right now.
This is Doyles house.
Im hired til one. They went to dinner and maybe nightclubbing.
Bryce the only man for this job is sitting right here in town.  Get me L. B. Jefferies.
Name me a better photographer.
It was in her favorite handbag  And Mr. Doyle that can lead to only one conclusion.
Of course its normal for a man to tie his trunk up with a heavy rope.
You didnt see the killing or the body? How do you know there was a murder?
Youve got a lot to lean about homicide Jeff. Morons have committed murder so shrewdly that it took a hundred trained police minds to catch them. That salesman wouldnt just knock off his wife after dinner toss her in a trunk and put her in storage.
His wife took a trip.
By the way  what happened to your leg?
 until yesterday morning.
I think thats about the time I fell asleep.
The building superintendent and two tenants. Flat statements  no hesitation. And they all jibed to the letter. The Thorwalds were leaving for the railroad station.
I hate to remind you  but this all started because you said she was murdered. Now did anyone including you actually see her murdered?
I can hear myself starting out. Your Honor  I have a friend whos an amateur sleuth an one night after a heavy supper   Hed throw the New York State Penal Code right in my face.  And its six volumes.
Is  is Anna  who I think it is?
Enough to scare me that you wouldnt get here in time and wed lose him.
Jewelry?
That wasnt Mrs. Thorwald who left with him yesterday morning?
Oh  that phone call  I gave them your number  hope you dont mind.
I dont know what pet name Thorwald had for his wife. And that night he went out half a dozen times with the metal suitcase. He wasnt taking his possessions because theyre up in his apartment now
In sections And one other thing doubting Tom  it just occurred to me that all the calls Thorwald made were long distance If he called his wife the day she left  after she arrived in Merritsville  why did she need to send him a postcard saying shed arrived?
For what?
Swell. I get myself halfkilled for you  and you reward me by stealing my assignments.
Yeah? Maybe in the high rent districts they discuss  but in my neighborhood they still nag.
Ill give you a chance to find out. Meet me in the bar at the Brevoort  and do it right away.
I predicted it.
Stella  in economics a kidney ailment has no relationship to the stock market. Absolutely none.
I knew it
Thats normal.
Nonsense. A man is always ready for marriage  with the right girl. And Lisa Fremont is the right girl for any man with half a brain who can get one eye open.
Her father loading up the shotgun?
The only honest thing to do is call it off. Let her look for somebody else.
The insurance Company would be a lot happier if you slept in your bed not the wheelchair.
Whatll you do if one of them catches you?
And shell end up fat alcoholic and miserable.
He and his wife splitting up?
Im not shy. Ive been looked at before.
You know? You might not be too bad a bargain for Lisa after all.
No.
You know Miss Fremont  he might just have something there.
What do you need money for?
Yes.
Goodnight you idiot.
Hows your leg?
That dress should be listed on the stock exchange.
Yes.
Almost as if it were being written especially for us.
It doesnt make sense to me. Whats so different about it here from over there or any place you go that one person couldnt live in both places just as easily?
Huh? Try and find a raincoat in Brazil. Even when it isnt raining  Lisa on this job you carry one suitcase. Your home is the available transportation. You sleep rarely bathe even less and sometime the food you even look at when they were alive
You dont think either one of us could ever change?
Dont you ever have any problems?
So do I.
I dont know what you consider it  but if you dont stop it Im getting out of here.
He had it hidden in the dresser Well at least it was in there. He took it out went to the phone and called somebody long distance.  His wifes jewelry was in the handbag. And something about it worried him. He was asking somebody advice over the phone.
I wonder where hes going now?
All day long Ive tried to keep my mind on work.
Basic equipment. You dont leave it behind in your husbands drawer in your favorite handbag.
Weird.  Why dont I slip into something comfortable?
Of course they have the same chance. They can look at me like a bug under glass if they want to.
Ill try to give you at least fifteen minutes.
Chelsea 27099.  We scared him once. Maybe we can scare him again.  Im using that word we a little too freely I guess. I dont take any of the chances.
Get an ambulance.  Dont move. Try to lie still.
Shut up. Im all right.
Feel okay?
Machismo?
Just him.
Buzz Gundersen.
Sure.  Its fine.
I like you you know?
You see any cops?
What time is it?
Tell him why we moved here.
You buy me many things.  Thank you.
What can you do when you have to be a man?

Why?
You talked to Nice Guy Eddie? Why the fuck didnt you say that in the first place?
Because this guys a fucking psycho. And if you think Joes pissed at us that aint nothing compared to how pissed off I am at him for puttin me in the same room as this bastard.
Hey bless your heart for what youre trying to do. I was panicking for a moment but Ive got my senses back now. The situation is Im shot in the belly. And without medical attention Im gonna die.
Fuck jail I dont give a shit about jail. But I cant die. You dont have to take me in. Just drive me up to the front drop me on the sidewalk. Ill take care of myself. I wont tell them anything. I swear to fucking god I wont tell em anything. Look in my eyes look right in my eyes.  Iwonttellthemanything. Youll be safe.
I havent had a chance to think. First I was just trying to get the fuck outta there. And after we got away Ive just been dealin with him.
Whats wrong with it?
No real people?
I dont wanna kill anybody. But if I gotta get out that door and youre standing in my way one way of the other youre gettin outta my way.
Yeah and that was a fucking miracle. But if they did get away where the fuck are they?
No theyre not in the car. No I dont have them on me. Ya wanna go with me and get em? Yes we can go right now. But first listen to what Im telling you. We were fuckin set up Somebody is in league with the cops. We got a Judas in our midst. And Im thinkin we should have our fuckin heads examined for waiting around here.
No shit?
Now youre using your head. For all we know hes the rat.
I gotta take a squirt wheres the commode in this dungeon?
So what do you suggest we go to a hotel? We got a guy whos shot in the belly he cant walk he bleeds like a stuck pig and when hes awake he screams in pain.
We had just gotten away from the cops. He just got shot. It was my fuckin fault he got shot. Hes a fuckin bloody mess  hes screaming. I swear to god I thought we was gonna die right then and there. Im tryin to comfort him telling him not to worry hes gonna be okay Im gonna take care of him. And he asked me what my name was. I mean the man was dyin in my arms. What the fuck was I supposed to tell him Sorry I cant give out that information its against the rules. I dont trust you enough.? Maybe I shoulda but I couldnt.
Who cares what your name is? Who cares if youre Mr. Pink Mr. Purple Mr. Pussy Mr. Piss...
Hello Graham  Joe  Mr. Gardner.
You dont know how good it is to see you.
Yes maam.
So am I.
But you eat dont you?
Where do you keep the can opener?
Of course itll work. You can get another girl to fill out the act.
Learnin to read has nothing to do with the right or the wrong side of the street.
You dont have to explain. Did I tell you how grateful I am for what youve done?
Youve earned it  the horse ranch on the Toulomoe  the girl in the spotted gingham.
But the rest is right.
You should have. I dont like leaving things unfinished.
Im awake now. Go on. Say what you want to say. Ill listen.
All my clothes 
Go on take it. Then you cant spend the rest of the trip expecting to get paid.
That job you were talkin about did you get it yet?
Stretch out under the seat Miss.
You might tell a fellow things specially if the fellows your brother seems to me.
What was he in jail for?
A man cant help gettin excited once in a while.
Can I have my gun back?
Okeh I was wrong. But you cant expect a fellow who never saw Lednov and never heard his name until a while ago to do too much worryin. Youve been sorta close mouthed about him.
Sure I remember. You went to Mexico lookin for cattle.
I didnt stop to think Clay.
Come on. We got a couple hours to eat and get some sleep.
What did you come back for?
Yeah  but dont make a habit of it.
Yeah how did you know?
I cant take her with me.
You cant stay here. Theres snakes and its cold and youll just get sicker.
Helen  why dont you and Mary go on with Clay?
But I want to stay.
Stop it  stop it.
That sure smells good.
Up here in the hills a man gets a hankering to smell powder.
I saw your fire and dropped by to say hello.
Not exactly. They decided gambling and dancing were bad for people.  Can I make it?
Aspen doesnt want us Mr. Graham. They threw us out.
Goodbye and thanks.
Maybe youre going about this all wrong. Why not try telling him well do the cookin and mendin and washin for him. That usually works.  Yeah but suppose he took us up on it. Where would we be?
Maybe I could start you out.
Gee I cant.
What comes after Z?
 and even if I do learn to read what usell it be? Im goin to live on a ranch
What do they look like?
How about California?
Nobodys gonna catch him sleeping. Dont worry about him.
You dont know what it is to be sorry.
Oh he was a widower. Why didnt you say that?...  Dont worry sweetie I can whip up a new batch in a flash.
Thats it.
Oh... I guess Ill die now.
We already know each other. Hey Brenda.
Ouch
Hello Brenda.
Wheres Shorty?
Hey you left your book back there.
So it looks like were going to be spending the weekend together.
Whoa check this out. She looks like you.
Oh yeah... another difference is she looks more sophisticated and classy. More feminine. And her tits are perfect. Not pointy and funny looking or spaced too far apart...
Well if thats Hanson then whos the guy with the hand?
Hey wanna share a soda?
What should we get?
Im sorry I should have been watching where I...
Oh right.

I dont like this this...
Ill make it part of the class. Well tell them theyre participating in a study on sleep disorders.
We record and document it. Were gonna make history Dwight. The first documented unrefuted evidence of life after death. The book sales alone will be worth millions. Ill be rich and you my friend will have one hell of a thesis paper. Now what time is orientation?
Would you please focus?
So if one of our little chickadees is taking a shower which one of these buttons do I press to get a close up?
I dont think so. Its on all the cameras and check this out. The thermal readings inside the house dropped ten degrees when the image was recorded.
Work work work. Is that all that you do?
You know Dwight I hear youre the only one who has the key to the gate.
What if I wanted to borrow those keys?
Shes right. We should stick together.
Whos first? Anyone like a wing?
You never could feel your legs.
Youre not wearing a belt.
Uh... Im Father McFeely
Father I think you should rest.
This part removes the sense of humor.
Sweet. Hey you got a tattoo too.

Mrs. Ackerman when you left me at the fleamarket where did you go?
Mrs... Sutphin?
Chip is off to a fine start this year.  Focused... conscientious... participates actively in classroom discussion.
He is assistant manager of a video shop...
No he did not We are a loving supportive family Mr. Stubbins.
I dont know what it is about today but I FEEL GREAT
Man that one made me puke
Look sister Manhattan is only nine miles long and four and one half miles wide. I aint never been off it. I know it like you know your own back yard. You get me a small retainer say fifty bucks and Ill get your sister for you. I guarantee
Wait a minute. This has got a lot of angles. Youve got to take it easy. Do you know a Mrs. Redi?
Thats what I tried to find out.I went to La Jeunesse    used a phony health inspectors badge  they let me go through the works  all but one room. That room was locked. Id like to see the inside of that room.
Sister you cant just go breaking into places. Theres a night watchman down there and locks on the door.
I dont like this.
Its only a little way Mr. August.
The acceptance of a secret is an obligation and in this case my dear the obligation carried with it the necessity of dying if one betrayed that secret. You understand that dont you?
Then you also understand that you must die.
When I wanted to.
I read your book. The one in which you wrote about the cure for drinking.
Ill give you a check.
Tell me how is Jacqueline?
But tell me 
Hows Miss Jacqueline?
I cant see much fun in teaching school. Why dont you go into the beauty business.
Redis all right.
And that was all?
You cant make it your lifes work looking for Jacqueline.   Youll have to do other things... live...get some enjoyment out of life. I hope youll let me help you.
Im sorry. I didnt intend to treat you like a child.
The people at the restaurant?
 What have you done about Irving August?
Good night Jacqueline  good night Mary.
Im going to find your sister.
All very nice but what are you going to do  listen at every house in New York for Jacquelines voice?
Hes clever and hes cautious in his way. If he knew I think hed advise her to do what I want  surrender herself to the police  stand trial  I dont think he knows.
Shell have to know some time.
Who are you?
And you dont want to die. Ive always wanted to die  always.
Im tired of being afraid  of waiting.
If you get lonely go down and see Mrs. Romari. I told her you were staying with me.
Wellthen I have spoiled your dinner  your food wont digest and your wine will sour.
Look. Im serious. Its a real and vary earnest society  a dangerous society...
It isnt that  you said have to go. What could compel you 
You went to see Mrs. Redi... She told you something  what was it?
Not I  I am alive yet every hope I had is dead  Death can be good. Death can be happy.. If I were really dying I could speak like Cyrano  My courage like a white plume  and all the other lovely words with which he greeted death. Then perhaps you might understand
Oh Mr. Jason. I really shouldnt be doing this you know. Its against the rules.  When did you say you wanted them?
Where is Jacqueline Gibson?
What was she to you?
Tell me where Jacqueline is  weve got to find her.
Yes. When I tell you.
Im afraid this is no time to play Cyrano my friend. What was in your mind?
What?
Dont be so amazed. Its a very ordinary matter. Im Jacquelines physician... Mr. Ward told me you were in town and Jacqueline has sent me to bring you to her.
Id hardly describe It that way  The worship of evil is a pretty dreadful and special thing.
Im stopping at the Chatsworth.
Ill be out in a minute.
That makes it all the more difficult 
We dont know Mary. Weve been unable to get in touch with your sister.
I have written repeatedly to Mrs. Redi. She vouchsafes no information whatsoever.  It is six months since your tuition has been paid Mary. Naturally it is impossible for you to stay on here as a paying pupil.
I thought you might know her. She was seen here about a week ago. Her name is Jacqueline Gibson.
Fo come ti pare. To desiderare sempre di vedere che cosa cera in quella stanza.
Is it fifteen minutes yet?
Ill be right back with Mrs. Wheeler.
I went back through the history last night. I read about Johann Rozenquartz  I read what he wrote 
It is a very real danger and one which forces our decision.
Jacqueline you have spoken so often of ending it all I cant understand why this should be so difficult for you. You have only to drink a little.
Oh uhhuh.
No I think you look... fine.
Oh I like it. I like it very much.
...freelance. You know.
Why? Didnt you know him well?
Do I pay taxes? Of course I pay taxes only a liar doesnt pay taxes Im not a liar. A liar is the second lowest form of human being.
Why is that?
As long as its not... gross you know? Like some scar or something. It has to be like mine like something about you.
Why do you say Im selfconscious?
Arent you?
Hi
Its a personal project Im working on.
And they just answer them?
I dont... why... why do you do this?
But even if we had been speaking I wouldnt have told you.
Yes. But I sense the element of revenge here.
Is he going to see this?
No.
About me?
Why not?
Thats correct.
Yes.
The problem was me. I was... I was a pathological liar. Or am I should say. Lying is like alcoholism one is always recovering.
Ann it could happen to me all over again dont you see? I could start to 
You mean youre still in contact with her?
Whoa Im so glad we got that on tape You wont answer a question about Elizabeth but I have to answer all these intimate questions about my sex life Graham what do you think shes going to make of all these videotapes? Are you going to tell her about them? I cant imagine her being too understanding about that. But since you dont lie anymore youll have to say something.
Dont do that.
Because.
Why are you ashamed?
But why cant you just put it all behind you? Cant you just forget it? All that stuff you did?
Thats the first thing that ran through my mind when I saw you. I thought this is not the same man that rode the unicycle naked through the homecoming parade.
Something wrong?
Theres nothing to know Ann.
For Gods sake Ann I am not fucking your sister. I dont find her that attractive for one.
Look this conversation is utterly ridiculous. Maybe when you have some evidence we should talk but dont give me conjecture and intuition.
Goddam right. I mean can you imagine Your honor Im positive this man is guilty. I cant place him at the scene or establish a motive but I have this really strong feeling.
I dont know. Sometimes I feel stupid babbling about my little problems while children are starving in the world.
Jesus Christ What the hell happened? I came home and your car was gone the door was open I thought for sure youd been abducted by some mad fucker I was literally just calling the cops when you walked in. What happened?
Bastard...
But he asked you to quit your job and you do have housework.
Prior to this feeling were you comfortable having physical contact with him?
Oh Graham. No I didnt talk to him about that. Actually that turned out to be pretty interesting. I expected Graham to be this... well like John you know? I mean he said they had gone to school together so I was expecting lots of stories about getting drunk and secret handshakes and stuff. But he turned out to be this... this kind of character I mean hes kind of arty but okay you know?
No he left last week.
Im glad you feel that way because I feel that way too.
What are you talking about?
I just thought it might 
I dont... he doesnt want you to come over.
No hes not dangerous. Not physically.
He just asked me questions.
I wanted him to see me.
You couldnt do it period.
I feel like I do.
I wish youd get an answering machine.
Well either you are or you arent. Which is it?
And you ask questions right?
What about when you touched it? What did you expect it to feel like and then what did it really feel like?
What did he say?
Would you like me to take my pants off?
Do you think Im pretty?
John doesnt have sex with Ann anymore.
Look Im just going to come right out and tell you why Im here okay?
Ouch. Okay I deserved that. Cynthia dont you understand? After the first time its just not spontaneous. Theres no edge anymore. Look at the tapes there is only one date on each label. I have never taped anyone twice.
Im sorry. I cant do it.
I cant let my lunch hour go on too long. Ive already skipped one meeting.
I have a friend coming in from out of town Ill probably be spending some time with him the next couple of days.
John?
Not today. Ive got other plans.
John Millaney.
Hello.
I felt like it so what? Goddam you and Ann make such a big deal out of it.
It wont. I trust him.
John we have nothing to talk about.
Plus first and last month deposit.
Im sorry. Am I prying again?
Especially if you want to leave someplace in a hurry.
Graham I swear to Christ Ill kill your scrawny ass. Now give me those tapes.
Answer him goddammit
May I ask whos calling?
Mr. Millaney?
...probably nothing at all. Its probably just a bunch of I dont know fatty cysts. You can have them removed in a doctors office. Has Nick seen a doctor?
No thanks. Just wanted to tell you that Dr. St. Luc is coming up to see Nick at ten or so.
Cmon lets smoke one of the cigarettes right now. Your fatherll never miss it.
Roger? If youre going to be staying here anyway why dont you come up to my place for a late supper?
Well? Supper at my place?
You say something?
Make love to me make love to me love love to me...
Want me to breathe deeply?
Good shape for an old man eh?
You want to help sick people for the rest of your life? God forbid I should talk you out of it.
OK I bite. What does it look like?
Maybe Hobbes didnt know it but Annabelle was a pretty popular girl around Starliner Towers. Ive got three men here maybe four whore hosting large freemoving apparently pathogenic abdominal growths that nobody Ive tried can identify. You were next on my list.
Ive got a date with one of them at ten. Can you make it?
BREAKING OUT
Later Brenda.  Ah Bert could you spare a moment?
Is it because Im becoming too popular?
How did you come by this scenario?
In a way...
McKinley?...McKinley?
SOME PEOPLE DO IT FOR ENSLAVEMENT
Ill leave you young things to it.
Oh Oliver.  What are we going to do?
YOUVE LOST YOUR HEART
SOME PEOPLE DO IT FOR FOR ENJOYMENT
What are you talking about? Danny Slepstrini is a chip off the old block.  I played 18 holes of golf with his father just last week.  And Hank says Dannys moved to New York.  To better himself.
Vance  Vance Parker.
I NEED SOME
Brad
BRAD
Lets hear the five Fs for today.  F for...
F for...
Our speciality.
Thats an extremely negative response.
THIS COULD BE THE START OF A WHOLE NEW CAREER HERE
And none of them worked?
And we also know how you feel were not strangers to confusion.
Nice technique there...  ...Cammi.
You picked him up and you fucked him didnt you bitch?
The fuck was that?
The problem with that is that then theres one extra 
Are you there? Miles?
Im sorry Miles. We did all we could. Youve been a real trooper.  Tell him Ill call back.
My condolences.
What do you think?
Busy night for a Tuesday. We had a busload of retired folks in on a wine tour. Usually theyre not too rowdy but tonight there was something going on. Full moon or something. What can I get you?
Theyre from both of us.
And what was that other one you did the one where youre the jogger?
Spray and Wash. Thats the one.
She was good for you.  And so beautiful and intelligent. You knew her right?
Now theres a girl who knows how to pour. Whats your name?
Hi.
I can explain.
Highliner please.
Are you a writer too?
I dont think so. Were celebrating Miless book deal.
No I didnt. What I said was that my agent had heard there was some interest at Conundrum...
Shut up.  Heres to a great week.
And?
How about the new ending? Did you like that?
There is no new ending. Page 750 on is exactly the same.
Whoa why are we getting off?
Your mother? Jesus Miles we were supposed to be up there hours ago.
Let me show you something. The secret to opening champagne is that once the cork is released you keep pressure on it so you dont 
Fuck man. Too early in the morning for that you know what I mean?
Speak for yourself. I get chicks looking at me all the time. All ages.
Itd be the best thing for you. You know what? Im going to get you laid this week. Thats going to be my best man gift to you. Im not going to give you a pen knife or a gift certificate or any of that other horseshit.
You know what? Lets take the Santa Rosa turnoff and hit Sanford first.
Oh Jesus. Look at some point we have to find out because its going to make a big difference.
This is rose right?
What do you smell?
I thought you said it was close. Now Im all pitted out.
We should have driven.
Were not getting any younger right? And my career well its gotten pretty you know frustrating. Even with my new manager. Maybe its time to settle down.
Heres to my last week of freedom.
Oh yeah. Thats Maya.
The chick digs you. She lit up like a pinball machine when she heard your novel was getting published.
Im trying to get you some action but youve got to help me out just a little bit.
Have you no shame?
I am going to get my nut on this trip Miles. And you are not going to fuck it up for me with all your depression and anxiety and neghead downer shit.
She has the best palate of any woman Ive ever known. She could even differentiate Italian wines.
Because I knew youd freak out and probably get so depressed you wouldnt even come on this trip. But then I figured here would be the best place to tell you. Were here to forget about all that shit. Were here to party
No no no. Its cool. I talked to Victoria. Shes cool. Everyones cool.
You gotta excuse him. Yesterday he didnt know Pinot Noir from film noir.
Were on.
Stephanie holy shit. Chick had it all going on.
Please just try to be your normal humorous self okay? Like who you were before the tailspin. Do you remember that guy? People love that guy. And dont forget  your novel is coming out in the fall.
Do not sabotage me. If you want to be a lightweight thats your call. But do not sabotage me.
Pull yourself together man.
Where were you?
Goddamn Miles she is nasty. Nasty nasty nasty.
Oh boy.
What the fuck are you doing?
Does she know about Saturday?
I was hoping to get some understanding from you. And Im not getting it.
Like I might be in love with another woman.
Heres what Im thinking. We move up here you and me buy a vineyard. You design your own wine Ill handle the business side. Then you get inspired and write a new novel. As for me if an audition comes along hell LAS two hours away. Not even.
Call me on my cell if you go out.
What about your agent? Hear anything yet?
Huh.
Were going to have some fun. Remember fun? Were going to have some of it. Okay?
You ever actually read any of this guys books?
What?
You sure you didnt say anything to Maya?
Her husband works a night shift or something and he comes home and Im on the floor with my cock in his wifes ass.
She tell you she was married?
So whats the plan?
Come on let me drive.
Oh no. Oh Christ. No you dont.

Yeah I know what you mean. Its a long drive up here. Wherere you staying?
Oh yeah? How is it?

Wow. We gotta give it a moment but this is tasty. Really good. How about you?
So whats your novel about?
Whats the title?
Yeah? Like what?
Bathroom over there?
Hey Miles I heard you came by the restaurant last night looking for me.
No weve got to get back Friday for the rehearsal dinner.
Were you ever going to say anything?
Ive told him. Ive told him over and over but hes out of control.
Hes an actor so it cant be good.
Heard you got remarried Congratulations. Didnt think you had the stomach for another goround.
I just wanted you to know Ive decided not to go to the wedding so in case you were dreading some uncomfortable you know runin or something well worry no more. You wont see me there. My wedding gift to you and whats hisname. What is his name?
Hi Vicki.  You look beautiful.
Thats great.
Seems like everyones getting married. A year ago it was all divorces. Now its all weddings. Cyclical I guess.
Oh. Huh. Well...  Congratulations again Vicki. Thats wonderful news.
How much skin and stem contact?
Huh. That explains all the tannins. And how long in oak?
So what do you think?
Huh.
Oops. Sorry.
Hi guys. We should probably get going.
See you Miles. You take care.
Whats wrong with the water next to your bed?
Not English though. You heard the voices right Uncle Merrill?
Listen Bo. This is very important. Everything people have written about in science books is going to change. The history of the worlds future is on the TV right now. We need to record this so you can show your children this tape and say you were there...  For your children Bo.
Im scared.
And tell Merrill to swing away.
Okay this guy is trying to scare us. Hes messed with our property hes coming around the house. Its time for an ass whoopin
Its noise.
How can you say that?
For the kids protection. All they were doing was watching TV from five a.m. I felt like they were getting obsessed like you said. They should be playing furry furry rabbit or tea party or something right?
Chicken Teriyaki.
Should we turn off the lights?
Theyre distracting us?
Hes been like that for awhile. We need to get him some medicine.
Hes not strong enough to fight off another attack.
Dont touch him.
Can I use Bos old baby monitor as a walkietalkie?
These are Ds I need double As.
I cant even imagine.
Its the strangest thing Father.
You said something was strange. Whats strange?
What about them?
Okay.  So he was tall?
Let me ask you two something. Dont be embarrassed by the answer. It is possible... Just possible now you might have been chasing each other around? You said you went in opposite directions.
I dont think so.
Is he okay?
Shes not in an ambulance Father.
Dont do it
The book says theyre probably very good problem solvers.
Forget the money. Youve got to get these people out of here. This is no place to be sitting with women and kids.
Emmett.
This was my fathers. The men who killed him took it.
Im surprised to see you out here tonight.
Goodbye?
You dont make it easy on a fellow.
Are you all right?
We told Sheriff Cobb about the attack.  He said hed... look into it.  I cant believe hes the law out here. Now I see why you all wear guns.
This time youre really going?  You know where Ill be.
Jefferson City?
Ive never been in there. They just jumped you out of the blue?
Looks like those boys are headed south so they werent the same ones that jumped me. Which way you going?
Doesnt look quite fair.
Youll have to deal me out on that. Ive had some experience with that sort of thing and I dont want any more.
Then I guess this is where we part ways. Sorry.
You might make a farmer yet.
Where is Rae?
Who?
What about the law?
He acted bravely out there Hannah. Just bad luck his getting hit. Could have been any one of us.
Never will again.
It was not  it was Murdos. Those McKendricks dont know how to act like human beings.
Didnt he tell you about Blind Pete?
You cant do this.
There are three strangers in this room traveller and these gents you are accusing arent them.  Are these your friends?
Hello Rae.
Im not sure but I got an idea. And when I am sure theyre going to pay.
What are you doing here Rae? This aint for you.
Why come to me?
Whats stopping you?
Yeah its working out real good.
Things are getting messy around here.  I hear Ezra Johnson got himself killed.
Ive given that up.
This is mighty sweet Paden. I think I finally found my place in the world.
What is it you want from me?
Im a great believer in doing nothing.
Im going to have to look into this.
You gotta calm down Paden. Everything will be put straight in a few days.
What a waste. This could have been such a sweet deal for us.
Stella... Are you the midnight star herself?
Its the only place Im happy.
Thats Kelly my socalled partner. He runs that side.
Yeah aside from being a loudmouthed lying cheat hes just the man I would have picked.
I dont own this place. The man who does stuck me with Kelly.
But not everyones imaginary are they Mr. Taransky?  I refer of course to Edith.
We all know what happened.  In a fit of jealous rage you killed Simone and dumped her body off a boat she bought for you.
Id love to stop somewhere but Im late.  Im on my way to see Viktor now.
Exactly.  Youre a household name now.  Youre moving in entirely different worlds.  Thats why I hope youre not toying with Viktor.
Its the truth.  Those 17 superstars are our insurance policy.  We cant open  cant make a profit without them.
Im not taking away your daughter just your deal.  You and I both know after the divorce I kept you on for old times sake so you could still hold your head up in front of Lainey.  I called whats his name at Warners.  He said hed take a meeting  in July.  Ive fought for you Viktor...  You want to talk severance?
Theyre yours.  But how are you going to finish it?  Without a star theres no movie.
I cant wait to meet her.
Viktor its my studio.
Viktor we simply have to talk about Eternity...
Whatever.  I still havent received Simones script notes.
Hair and makeup?
She was in the theater?  When? Where?
There isnt one.
Experience Viktor.  Ive seen this a hundred times  young stars destroying the very people who discovered them.  Im worried about you thats all.  This woman  she controls your destiny.
I got them to remove the reflection.  The mirrors metaphor  to show how her characters inwardly dead.
Yes.  To be honest I never quite saw this film before  maybe its the way Simone is playing it  but what its saying about the illusion of permanence in everyday life how thats the only way we can love  I think its really going to mean something.
Ill tell you what.  I know how much this means to you.  Ill try to get her to plug the film.  Im not promising anything but maybe shell do a talk show  taped.
She was there.  She didnt by any chance happen to mention me?
Whenever I compliment Simone you take the credit.
My two favorite girls.
... Simone.
As a matteroffact I am.
I just read somewhere 
This is crazy.  Who am I fooling? I cant compete with Simone.  What woman can?
Of course she will.  Her public will demand it.
Im going to tell you a secret now Elaine.  Simone is not a real person.  I invented her.
Can I see you later  go away for the weekend?
I was thinking  what about you and... Simone moving back in with me and Lainey?
Dont look so glum Viktor.  Its not a death sentence.
Where are you?
Mom do you miss Dad?
Lets go Lainey.  Theres nothing here.
You had no choice Elaine.  Hes a liability.
Youre with me to be close to her?
Well no one could accuse you of being overexposed Simone.  Why have you stayed so completely out of the limelight?
And still the connection was undeniable.  I havent read Eternity Forever but I know its brilliant.  And I know I would be perfect for Clive.
Youll never guess who Im with... you ran into him on the lot.
 No.  No.  A real wall.  You ran right through it.
You know I sometimes forget she has bodily functions.
 We call them vactors.
Not quite how I imagined it 
Shes a miracle Dad.  Where did you find her?
Okay Dad.
Goodnight Daddy.
Hey Lainey.  Hows your love life?
Too impersonal.  They have to meet facetoface.
 Plead guilty and throw yourself on the mercy of the court.  Its the best deal youre going to get.
Nice try.  If we cant get to her through you maybe your family will be more cooperative.  I can guarantee you Taransky one way or another Miss Simone and I are going to get acquainted.
I know what youre up to.
Ive done my homework.  Ive studied her.
I know thats what youd like us to believe.  But I got to tell you  embezzlement is a serious matter. Not to mention abduction.
You love her dont you Max?
Taransky isnt that good an actor. No theyre taking special precautions.  Some kind of new encryption.
Well we got some of Taranskys fingerprints a lot of your fingerprints... but none of hers.
Mr. Sayer...
Mr. Sayer did we pay the million bucks yet?
 Ive been here before  On my honeymoon with my exwife.
A lots happened since we last saw each other.
Good morning Simone.
Maybe he can.
The only real truth is in the work.
Youre going to get in a lot of trouble Mr. Taransky.
Mahogany. Id say that cost at least a couple hundred. Maybe three.
Are you calling me?
Why Malcolm?
All your soldiers speak Latin?
I got an award once. From the Mayor.
Know what?
What kind of words?
I didnt know you were funny.
Once upon a time there was a prince who was being driven around... He drove around for a long long time... Driving and driving... It was a long trip... He fell asleep...  When he woke up they were still driving... The long drive went on
Yes.
No.
Dead people like in graves and coffins?
How often do you see them?
...No.
Yes?
Can I ask you then?
What do you want more than anything?
I told you what I want.
What?
Dont cry.
Dr. Crowe?
Are you wigging out?
Were not gonna start crying again are we?
I believe both of you now.  And I think I might know how to make them go away.
You know that accident up there?
Dead people?
You see ghosts Cole?
What are you thinking Momma?
Cole this was a legal courthouse. Laws were passed here. Some of the first laws of this country. This building was full of lawyers. Lawmakers.
Excuse me?

Id watch your step if I were you son.
See?
Fuck you.
Bitch.

Sounds familiar.
Wait a second. Did you say patricide?

The ancient Aztecs knew how powerful this stuff was.
So... what does it do?
Should we be doing this dude?
What are you going to do? Shoot me?
Im your son. And Laureens son.
I came back for the funeral. Thats all.
That old barn. After the fire... I rebuilt it nail by nail. Just the way your granddaddy wouldve wanted it.
Old slave superstition. You sprinkle a little blood mixed with water on the crops you get yourself a good harvest... So they say.
Jesus. What a bunch of useless zombies.
Yeah. Maybe I can pick a little cotton for da masta.
You seen Mac? His bed hasnt been slept in.
You never told us you grew up on a farm.

The trap door. Thats how he escaped the fire...
...no... Mac... pplease...
It gets worse. Hes cut all the phone lines.
Was always curious why you... married Grant in the first place... Just never seemed outta love.
Grant used to get filled up every day. I knew it was just to see me. He was too old  But he was handsome. And he had that big ol Lincoln then. I flirted with him.
After all this shit tonight I know for sure now you regret not running off with me to Hollywood
What are you doing?
Please Starla. Im gonna do my best not to hurt anybody 
What?
Rorschach.
Oh shit I hope she aint a police radio aficionado. If so I apolog
Its just a work thing.
Grant no  Im sorry Im just  Im not in the mood. Grant is on top of her breathing a little too heavy. GRANT Come on baby its 
Whyd you betray me sugarplum?
Now hes here. He went in Mr. Grant.
When one sees you they all see you.
Maybe you better sit back down. You dont look so good.
You.
Get your hands off my daughter
Youre crazy man. Smart dresser but crazy.
Why are you doing this obviously macho feat?
Well?...
Driving talking to me...
Seriously??
Anything?
You know youre not a bad driver.
Your honeymoon wouldve never been this exciting.
What the hell are you doing??
Yeah.
Mississippis the other way
 Trucking aint the easiest life in the world. I mean you cant make it much past fifty and you sure as shit dont get a gold watch when you hang it all up. But I like keeping on the move. You know?
I... uh... I dont know. I guess dont like to think about it.
An unmarked police car.
Im sure the Arkansas Bears put out an allpoints.
Im proud of you.
I been thinking. Maybe I should drop you in Montgomery. I mean the way things are going it might get pretty hairy by the time we get to Atlanta.
Why are you stopping?
See ya Bandit.
Why should I?
But youll do it?
Twentyeight hours Youre outta your gord.
That means we gotta average ninety four miles per.  Forget it.
You know of course we aint ever gonna make it.
What are you doin now?
Youre wall to wall and tree top tall.
Loud and clear.
Lets get the hell outta here.
You cant swear on these.
Whats a Texas Smokey doing in Arkansas man?
Just fine. Whats the weather like?
Youre coming up to the scale house.
Bandit I let me offer my heartiest congratulations and a piece of advice.
Hows the clock Bandit II.
Bandit I just thought Id lay a Smokey report on you.
Breaker Breaker. This is Bandit I coming up on a portable gas station. Do you copy?
Uhuh. What Cobra?
Five thou.
 Thanks much. Id like to get me a Smokey report?
 Did ya hear they nailed the Bandit?
But with these down doesnt that pose a major security concern if as you say you have to keep an eye on everything at all times?
Is your security team armed?
Anything on the Swede?
Maybe hes that good. Never been caught no criminal record.
But the Bureau knew Sparazza killed Heller. Why not go after him guns blazing for that one?
Did the Justice lawyers sign off?
What about the sheriffs task force?
Did he give you his name?
 run both those names through the D.C. database. Call San Francisco see if theyve got anybody in the field doing collateral inquiries for 
Who?
I did. We  yeah I know.
Are you on a land line?
Two security levels the one were going in under the guise of hotel security has restricted access. Theyre mostly there to monitor the lobby handle disturbances on the different floors and toss out drunks.  Theres a thirtyfive member employee rotation going from graveyard to day shift. If we split up we can blend in and enter unnoticed. Once were inside the hotel well regroup.
Dyou talk tom?
Whatd you say?
I said that we were returning his call and you were real concerned because he sounded real concerned.
FUCK YOU
And I vibe that kiddo I do indeed but its onea those fait accompli things you have to 
Sparazza is rumored to have performed in excess of onehundred and thirty contract murders including one of the bureaus most celebrated agents. Freeman Heller. You heard of The Turnpike Murders that was Sparazza.
On an extradition flight back to El Salvador he murdered a security detachment and vanished.
My debrief 
Youre finished.
Sparazza was in failing health and looking for a donor. The son who had betrayed and burned him so thoroughly seemed a obvious choice.
...When did you know all this?
You got clicks anything?
 yeah now lemme finish I was eavesdroppin so give me sec lay this thing out since the information might be a little loose 
Ygotta ygotta. But dya think theyll kick ransom for that little prick assuming we get tom.
Wow.
Shoot.
Well Im hearin the Swedes been dispatched hes flying so 
That takes some of the sting out.
 I dont know I feel like you always pushin up on me gettin close and I love you baby in every way you can love a bitch cept that one.
What Im saying is Dont trust anyone.  Find yourself a weapon of some sort.
Youll end up like me.
You have to give me your word you wont come in.  Then Ill come out.
I am here to recover this mission report my findings and make a recommendation.  Now What happened to him?
You didnt bring any chocolate did you?
How much sleep do you need?
I told you try to stay calm.  Youre supposed to be the psychologist of the bunch.
Is it being deliberately cruel you mean?  I dont think so.
Stop equivocating  Unbelievable how you equivocate  You the atheist youre more dogmatic than any holy person Ive ever seen  This is happening Kelvin.  Wake up.
Well I think were reaching the point of diminishing returns here right?  Certainly its learning more about us than well ever learn about it.
What do you want to do leave the station with her?
Kelvin shell disintegrate.  You dont believe me?  Lets radio that shuttle pod you launched  better yet lets go get it.  Ive charted its trajectory only take a few hours...

And Death Shall Have No Dominion.
He has a point.
You feel sorry for Solaris or for me?
Thats what you were saying.  I heard what you were saying.
I have these strange thoughts I dont know where they come from.  I cant explain it.
What do I have to do to stop it?
Did you hear what Gibarian said? Im not a human being.  Im an instrument.  I came from your memory and your imagination and I will torture you no matter what.  Even if I remain passive.  Thats when I drank the...  I was going mad.  It felt like there was no body underneath my skin. There was something else.  An illusion.  But I could feel my heart beating and I remembered you tested my blood.  Is it like yours?
Is that really what you want?
Last night.  You were talking to someone in the corridor.
Hi.
I think maybe that isnt such a great idea...
What did he say?
Would you pick one out please?
Put it on my account please.
I shouldnt have listened to you I shouldve followed you right into the can the way he did.
You wouldnt happen to know what language they speak in India do you?

Is that bug juice or are you just glad to see me?
I see.  So Amazing SpiderMan Ill assume thats not your given name

He left.  I couldnt believe it he just left  Its as if hes somewhere else... Im only getting a piece of him.
I hate
No.  I was lying about the coffee.
Well no.
Youd feel what?
Hello Liz.
Octavius wasnt the murderer type.
Aunt May youre trespassing.
Its Friday night...
The record
I was napping on the couch.  There was a voice and a shot.  I woke up. Ben was looking at me.
A bit melodramatic but if you could prove it that would tie in your unified field theory the Big Bang KaluzaKlein
Life and death matter. Yours everyones.  By comparison our search for truth is only a product of curiosity a game
Your dog ate it.
This photo you took of SpiderMan 
The paper my boy.  A solid Bplus.
Kid you were terrific.  Max Reiss novelty acts.  Was that judo or something?  Ah skip it.  Question is can you do it again?
I sent for  the police.  We can explain.
Youre sure youre all right.
Logic.  Lot 49 is the closest stockpile of SL 270  I do feel foolish talking with a man dressed like a
Loonytunes.  And yet...
Professor you ever fly one of these things before?
Jawohl.
Maybe just a hint or so. Think hard.
Wwwill that do or do you want some mmm ?
I understand how you feel Cookie. Its sort of rough  one American squealing on other Americans. Then again Cookie  maybe that stoolies not an American at all. Maybe hes a German the Krauts planted in this barracks. They do this type of thing. Just put an agent in with us  a trained specialist. Lots of loose information floating around a prison camp. Not just whether somebody wants to escape but what outfits we were with and where we were stationed and how our radar operates. Could be couldnt it?
Hold it Sefton. So we heard some shots  so who says they didnt get away?
You would would you? Listen Stupe  the first week I was in this joint somebody stole my Red Cross package my blanket and my left shoe. Well I wised up since. This aint no Salvation Army  this is everybody for himself. Dog eat dog.
Static is right The radios static Pattons static were static
I suppose they also know about your distillery and the horseraces?
Yeah what about it?  Cut the horsing around. We know hes the stoolie and we know what the pay off is. Lets get on with it.
Put me down for ten you louse.
How did he get over there?
The S.S. Men are here to pick up Dunbar. Theyre taking him to Berlin. Looks like hes finished.
You killed them huh? Both of them?
Maybe he would. We applied for Officers Training together remember? They turned me down but Im glad to see you made it. Of course it couldnt be that all that dough behind you had something to do with it  His mothers got twenty million dollars.
I am Lieutenant Dunbar.
105353.
Ever try forty sleeping pills?
There will be two S.S. men here tomorrow to take you to Berlin. You will be interrogated by the General Staff. When you come to the part about your arrest Im sure you wont forget to give me the proper credit.
As for the blankets you will notice they are very warm. Fifty percent wool.
And the way you search your prisoners it does sound rather unlikely.
Jawohl
Hey Schulz I got a deal for you. Suppose you help us escape. Well go home and have everything ready for you in Madison Square Garden. For the world championship Schulz the Beast of Bavaria versus Halitosis Jones
How? We go to California. I got a cousin thats working for the Los Angeles Gas Company. Thats how we get the address see? Isnt that clever? I take you up to her house and ring the doorbell and say Congratulations Miss Grable. We have voted you the girl wed most like to be behind barbed wire with and Im here to present the award.
Harry  Im blind
What do those broads say?
Let me do it Hoffy.
...a Lieutenant James Dunbar?
Look  if you dont like the way Im handling this job 
I dont know what your scheme is but it sounds crazy.
Just as you say Hoffy. But wouldnt it be smarter if I went out and kept Schulz tied up?
No volunteers Price. I said were all in on it.
Why the south latrine?
Los los. Dummkopf
We know We got them last year. Five minutes after the Geneva Man was gone the blankets were gone.
Stay out of it Sefton.
If you cant get the BBC how about getting Guy Lombardo?
Whats the big idea Sefton? Take that telescope out of here.
Hurry up on that trap.  What are you trying to do Sefton? Gum up the works?
How do they know?
You off your rocker?
Now youve done it. Youve given me nervous indigestion.  Anything else bothering you boys?
No. I dont sprechen sie deutsch.
December seventh fortyone.
Let us see. We have now two empty bunks here.  Nummer einundsiebzig und Nummer dreiundsiebzig in Baracke vier.
Nun? Was ist? Haben Sies herausgefunden?
You should go and see the doctor. Maybe I can   Silk stockings?
Youd better talk Schulz because Im going to find out with you or without you. Because I wont let go for a second. Because theyll have to kill me to stop me. So talk
Whats the matter with you? You want to be killed?
Gentlemen tomorrow morning the Geneva Man is coming to inspect the camp whether we are living up to the International Convention. I am sure he will find we are treating you very well. You must not run around in your underwear. And take off the wash. The Kommandant wants all the barracks to be spic and also span.
So youre stuck with me eh?
I thought he was the Chief Engineer.
Guinan said Soran was trying to get back to the ribbon. If thats true then there must be some connection with the Amargosa star.
Data are you all right?
No. And what you must try to avoid is becoming consumed by another emotion which I believe youre beginning to experience guilt.
Courage is an emotion too Data.  Now can you project the course of the ribbon?
Now you said the gravitational forces in this sector have been altered could that also affect the course of the ribbon?
I get it. I get it.
Sensors show five life signs aboard the station Captain.
We all are Data. But were going to get him back.
I have rerouted auxiliary power to the lateral thrusters attempting to level our descent.
Where is he now?
Can I?
Beautiful day isnt it?
This clock I gave this clock to Bones.
So youre telling me this is the 24thcentury and Im dead?
No no its not. Its better.
Yes.  Thank you.
Im not going  Scotty help me with this chute.
You know Scotty it amazes me.
Lets try to move beyond the usual prisonerinterrogator banter shall we? You have information and I need it.  Did the Captain explain his orders to you? Did he say why you were searching for trilithium?
I just stopped your heart for five seconds. It felt like an eternity didnt it? Did you know that you can stop the human heart for up to ten minutes before the onset of brain damage?
Is there a problem?
There is something else Captain. One of the scientists a Doctor Soranhas insisted on speaking with you.  I told him you were busy sir but he said it was absolutely imperative that he speak with you right away.
Report.
Captain are you all right?
Captain Im sorry.  I know there were a lot of unresolved conflicts between you and your brother.
Or perhaps theyre on the surface.
An experimental compound the Romulans have been working on. In theory a trilithiumbased explosive would be thousands of times more powerful than an antimatter weapon. But they never found a way to stabilize it.
I have spoken to the Klingon High Council sir. They identified the Bird of Prey as belonging to the Duras sisters.
Tractor beam aye
Steady... Steady boys. Keep scanning...  I thought you people were reliable... Where the hell is he
Mr. Chekov I ordered Spocks quarters sealed
Will we get another ship?
Unit two this is One. The Kobayashi Maru has set sail for the promised land. Acknowledge.
Excelsior closing to 4000 meters sir.
Response?
Nothing on my scanner sir.
Could it be Spocks?
This is where the fun begins Saavik
Approximately two meters long... Cylindrical in form...
Did your collaborator know?
The Genesis wave started a life clock ticking for him and the planet. But at the rate things are going now...
Whoever they are theyre getting closer.
Captain this is Saavik. Come in please...
Im sure Starfleet would approve sir.
Steady... Steady... All right Mr. Scott.
Admiral this is Lieutenant Saavik.
The Katra ritual is meant to deposit Spocks consciousness in the Hall of Ancient Thought  not in his body.
Or less. What you describe is called Fal Tor Pan  the refusion. It is very dangerous. The elders may not choose to attempt it.
The word sir?
Count on our help sir.
Yes. Enough energy to hide a ship wouldnt you say?
Mr. Sulu youre on manual.
Standby automatic approach system ... Advise approach control.
How is Doctor McCoy sir?
Why  a natural desire to help finish the work we began
Jim... You are my best officer and if I had a best friend youd be that too. But I am Commander Starfleet so I dont break rules
Youre right.  Thanks for the drink.
There are two more prisoners Admiral. Do you want them killed too?  Surrender your vessel
Maltz. Prisoners are at beam coordinates. Standby...
Give me what I want  and Ill consider it...
Sir. Your son meant more to me than you can know. Id have given my life if it would have saved his. You must believe me when I tell you that he made no request of me
Bones...
We are going to this planet. Even as our emissaries negotiate for peace with the Federation we will UactU for the preservation of our race We will seize the secret of this weapon. The secret of ultimate power
We are cloaked. Enemy closing on impulse power. Range 5000 Kellicams.
We still have the prisoners sir. Perhaps their information 
Youre not going in there  
Romulan Ale Bones you know this stuff is illegal 
Cheers. Bones these are... charming.
Slide them down your nose. Now look at me over the top. And you read printed matter through the bottom.
Bull. Youre hiding  hiding behind the rules and regulations 
Dont mince words Bones tell me what you really think.
Shore leave Admiral.
It never rains but when it pours 
They even killed the galley chief.
Lieutenant you are looking at the only Starfleet cadet who ever beat the nowin scenario 
David was right wasnt he? Its just to keep them busy.
How can you let them pull that stuff on you? Theyre just lazy.
David 
Dont tell me youve got something.
I told you I told you I saw a 
uBotany Bayu  oh no
He left us.  We were no longer of use. SAAVIK Where is  the Reliant crew? Dead?
I would think so sir. Hes on the Fleet General Staff.
To Doctor Marcus the civilian director of the experiments on Space Laboratory Regula I.
Im Admiral Kirk...
Why didnt you tell me?
No sir We have Genesis  Whatever you want 
An emergency situation has arisen. By order of Starfleet Command as of now 1800 hours I am assuming command of this vessel. Duty officer so note in the ships log. Plot a new course for Space Laboratory Regula I.  Mr. Scott?
Mr. Scott on discrete.
Midshipman youre a tiger.
Admiral Ive got to take the mains off the line. The energizers shaken loose and I cant get in there to fix her  radiation 
Yes Spock.
Spock this is Kirk. Its two hours. Are you about ready?
Permission to come aboard Captain?
Something may be wrong at Regula I. Weve been ordered to investigate.
That wont be necessary just take me to Regula I.
But it may be nothing garbled communications. Why dont you...
Will you accompany me to the bridge?
It literally is Genesis...
Whats she doing here?
Is it possible their COMM system has failed  ?
Their coil emissions are normal... Wait their shields are going up. Theyre locking phasers  
Not enough against their shields.
The prefix code?
A distinct possibility.
In my quarters Uhura.
Uhura Whats happening? Damn it...
I failed to resolve the situation.
May I ask how uyouu dealt with the test?
Indeterminate life signs.
Admiral?
How?
Hold your course. Look sharp...
Saavik get us out best speed
Ill be in my quarters if needed but I would prefer...
Yes well why dont you show him around and...
I really must thank you.
Course plotted for Regula I Admiral...
Approaching Regula and Space Lab Regula I.
Admiral on the bridge 
Were over our heads. Mr. Sulu get us out of here.
Fire all phasers...
Hes not what I expected Sir.
All moorings are clear Captain.
Sir may I quote General Order 12 On the approach of any vessel when communications have not been est 
Certainly...
I do this because I was there
I would accept that as an axiom.
Dont tell me fish stories kiddo. Ive known you too long.
Professor Scott Im Dr. Nichols plant manager. Im terribly sorry but theres been an awful mixup Would you believe I was never told about your visit?
Sure slingshot around the Sun. If you pick up enough speed youre in time warp. If you dont you fry..
It doesnt look all that different.
Hes coming round Jim...
Spock its me Bones I mean our experience was unique. You really have gone where no man has gone before. Cant you tell me what it felt like?
You mean I have to die to discuss your insights on death?
There are millions of other species on Earth Doctor. Only human arrogance would assume the message was meant for man.
Specifically Humpback Whales.
Well youre gonna have to take your best shot.
... I dont think he understands...
What the hell do you think youre doing?
Whats your degree in dentistry?
Fundoscopic examination 
A simple evacuation of the expanding epidural hematoma will relieve the pressure.
Whats causing that?
... It gives me a great sense of history.
My name?
Status report Admiral
Attempting the hell to communicate.
Are you sure it isnt time for a colorful metaphor?
You mean man...
Well for one thing we simply dont have the money to keep feeding them a couple of tons of shrimp a day
We dont want to be any trouble.
Then 
Or believe Ill bet.
So how did a nice girl like you get to be a cetacean biologist?
Whats that?
Wanna try it from the top?
Well Admiral that may be the strangest dinner of my life and the biggest cockamamie fish story Ive ever heard.
Here... In the park?
Its true... what you said...
Steady now. We need your help.
You cant. Our next stop is the 23rd Century.
Hey  Where you going?
Well I... As they say in your century  I dont even have your phone number. How will I find you?
Spock could the Humpbacks answer to this call be simulated?
But we cant turn away Is there no alternative?
Not with this equipment. I have had to program some of the variables from memory.
I think well find what were looking for at the Cetacean Institute in Sausalito. Two Humpbacks called George and Gracie.
Come on fellah  speak up
Youve done it before. Cant you remember?
Mr. Spock where the hell is the power you promised me?
Can we make breakaway speed?
Spock Condition report
Warp Nine... Nine point two... Nine point three...
10 seconds sir
I have no control sir
What is it?
Individual whale song getting stronger... This is strange Admiral. The song is directly ahead. Its coming from San Francisco.
Admiral I have a signal closing on the whales. Bearing 328 degrees.
Mr. Scott how soon can we get underway?
Scotty how long is this bay?
That should be enough. Can you enclose it to hold water?
Its going slow sir. Itll be well into tomorrow.
The whales...?
Excelsior? Why in Gods name would you want that bucket of bolts?
And... Here is a deposition I have made. If it is not sufficient I will return to Earth to testify.
Well Saavik. I guess this is goodbye.
Dont know anything about it? I find it difficult to believe that Ive come millions of miles 
Doctor Nichols I might have something to offer uyouu.
Ojichan? Akira ojichaan dewa naino? Koko de nani shiteru no?  
My people have a strict policy of noninterference with other cultures. In fact its our Prime Directive.
Clearly the architects of this conspiracy have tried to keep it a secret. Not just from you but from my people as well.  I dont intend to let them.
Most of my people who live that faster pace would sell their souls to slow it down.
I wonder if youre aware of the trust you endanger JeanLuc Picard. In my experience its unusual for...
But I have three hundred and eighteen days of vacation time coming. I plan on using them.
Do you really think your mighty Federation would be interested in protecting six hundred people?
There is no need for concern. I am operating within normal parameters now.
My father told me I shouldnt talk to you.
I know why.  So people like us wont be afraid of you any more.
No... I want to stay with you...
To many offlanders what you have here would be more valuable than goldpressed latinum.  And Im afraid its the reason that someone is trying to take this world away from you.
Hello Data...
... it is conceivable I was shot to protect the secret of its existence.
Why would the Federation or the Sona wish to move the Baku?
Your selfrestraint puzzles me Admiral. You continue to deny yourself every benefit this mission has to offer...
It isnt safe for you to remain in this area.
Take me down. Let me talk to Picard.
The Enterprise can be at your position in two days Admiral...
Captain I wasnt expecting you.
All right. You have twelve hours Captain. Then I want you out of The Briar Patch. In the meantime well be heading out to the perimeter to call for Sona reinforcements in case you fail.
Thats why we put chromodynamic shields in place  so our people wouldnt feel the effects from the metaphasic radiation...
With metaphasics lifespans will be doubled... an entire new medical science will evolve...  I understand your Chief Engineer has the use of his eyes for the first time in his life... would you take his sight away from him?
Order them to surrender and I promise you wont be court martialed.
A coward... without the moral courage to stop an unspeakable atrocity. You offend me.
Gallatin So the righteous Starfleet Captain finally released you. Did you encounter any problems on the surface?
The injector performs perfectly in every simulation...
Admiral Dougherty will not be joining us for diner. Deploy the collector.  Do you have a problem with those orders?
Moving them is one thing. Killing them all...
The torque sensors are out of alignment... by twelve microns... you could hear that?
By a Sona weapon.  Theres no doubt about it sir. Thats what made Data malfunction.
His ethical and moral subroutines took over all of his basic functions...
Implants bothering you?
Aye sir. Highly volatile...I recommend we keep our distance...
Sir theyve detonated an isolytic burst... a subspace tear is forming...
Whats inside that nebula cluster?
They need us to mediate some territorial dispute...
... and gorgonzolla cheese.
Admiral Dougherty wants to know why we havent left yet...
Prepare the ship for departure at ohsevenhundred hours.
Would you like something to eat?
Worf you must hurry...
Ive already modified a tricorder with one of his spare actuation servos. Its operational range is only seven meters but it should shut him down...
Come out come out wherever you are...
All injector subsystems are confirmed offline.
Oh my God are they vegetarians? Thats not in here...
The Sona discovered an Mclass planet with humanoid life six months ago. Turned out its in us to get approval for a sociological study. The Federation Council suggested it be a joint mission...
I dont see anything to suggest the Sona have any interest in sociology...
What youre doing to my neck...
This isnt one of the usual therapeutic postures...
Why dont you try sitting up?
... Im not sleeping well...
This ship is equipped with fourteen long range transporters... are they all useless...?
The new quantum torpedoes are doing the trick JeanLuc. Weve destroyed fortyseven Borg ships so far... and only lost fifteen of our own.  But one of the Borg ships has broken through our defenses and its heading directly for Earth. Can you handle it?
Cochrane... the inventor of warp drive?
Its not the radiation... and theres nothing wrong with the combadges... the Enterprise just isnt responding.
But I had a little help. Surgical transporter. I used it to beam out most of the bone fragments from his brain.
Regardless of how I may feel about Ruby... our fates lie along different paths. Nothing can change that.
Beverly there were many reasons why you and I...
Is it Japanese?
No. I will not betray my friends.
Ive deactivated the sensory inputs. That flesh on your body is just meat now.
It has entered Earth orbit.  Correction  it is not in orbit. It is heading directly toward the surface.
Who are you?
This must be it.
Blast door. Its designed to protect the control room when the missile is launched.
Picard to Enterprise.  Enterprise please respond.
Ready to make a little history?
The nacelles are charged... nuclear warhead standing by. Were ready to ignite the warp drive.
Theyre getting awfully close... what the hell are they doing?
Where are you from most recently?
And what were you doing out at the missile silo?
What do you want?
What are you an idiot? Didnt you see the red light was on?
Did you need something?
Im an old friend... I met him when he was doing his undergraduate work at Cornell back in 
Ruby... I need to talk to you about those photographs. Its very important.
Id say you already have.
We?
Track their weapons fire.
They mustve done it in the past... they went back and changed history...
Report.
Casualties are light Captain. Minor buckling on the port nacelle. Nothing serious.
I have assigned two damage control teams to locate the source of our communication problems. So far theyve had no success.
We saw at least thirty...and there are twentytwo Enterprise crewmembers reported missing... including Commander Data.
To control the Enterprise theyll have to gain access to one of two locations. Main Engineering... or the Bridge.
What are they doing?
You will have to realign the targeting array of the quantum torpedo... and reprogram the warhead for the localized detonation.  Theres only one torpedo left...
Someone...?
I remember it made me sick.
What the hell happened down there Worf?
Mr. President we cannot allow Federation citizens to be abducted.
Spock that was actually funny.
Calm yourself doctor the operation is almost complete...
Pity theyre retiring us just as I was starting to understand you Spock...
Thanks...
ABSOLUTELY NOT
Time we got underway ourselves gentlemen.  Once again weve saved civilization as we know it.
This is fun...
Too bad we cant SMELL her.
I dont believe we can get more out of the way than this.
What are you in for if you dont mind me asking?
Theyll respect him now...
To be or not to be that is the question which preoccupies our people Captain Kirk. We need BREATHING room...
Hes a DOCTOR
Under article 184 of Interstellar Law I place you both under arrest. You are charged with assassinating the Chancellor of the High Council.
What?
And you still maintain your ship did not fire on Kronos One? Would you have known if she had? Come now Captain. The record clearly there were no other ships in the sector.
And what did they tell you?
Louder please. We cannot hear you.
Where is Mr. Sulu?
Captain youre not going to show them the bridge??
Captain if they fire at us with our shields down 
From Starfleet?
Shes here  somewhere.
Shields. Battle stations.
Mr. Chekov slow down. Take us forward thrusters only one quarter impulse power.
This is the first evidence that corroborates our theory.
Aye sir.
An INCIDENT?
Thank you Captain.
Wed be delighted to accept your gracious invitation.
Chancellor may I present Commander Spock whom I believe you know Dr. Leonard McCoy chief medical officer Montgomery Scott chief engineer...
Listen. No one has ever escaped from Rura Penthe.
Maybe if their particles just got a wee bit mixed...
As you were. Lieutenant...?
Aye sir.
Captain our shields  
Who is US?
This is Captain Sulu USS Excelsior.
Where?
Captain...
The peace conference.
Are you dining on worms?
Whats she waiting for?
Control tower reading Sir.
Channel open Captain.
Gorkons own man??
You have done well Saavik. As your sponsor at the Academy I have followed your career with... satisfaction. And as a Vulcan.
You must have faith.
How did you  ?
Her own father...?
If you are logical.
Perhaps neither of us was hearing very well that night Lieutenant. There were things I tried to tell you too  about having faith.
Apparently theyre refusing to acknowledge signal to return to spacedock sir.
You can check the torpedoes visually if you like 
And if theyre still in place?
A Bird of Prey canna fire when shes cloaked
I assume command of this ship as of  0130 hours. Uhura send to Starfleet HQ. Explain precisely what has taken place and request instructions.
Sulus giving us his position and telling us hes standing by...
Can you tell me how you came to be on the planet where we found you?
Do you know the name of the Captain of this vessel?
Why?
Why?
Do you know anything about Shinzons plans against the Federation?
Do you have any knowledge of the tactical abi1ities of this ship?
No. I must deactivate you.
It has the ability to consume organic material at the subatomic level. I cant overestimate the danger of Thalaron radiation Jean Luc. A microscopic amount could kill every living thing on this ship in a matter of seconds.
I so wanted to believe Shinzon. But the Thalaron radiation cant be explained away. Whatever hes after its not peace.
A weapon.
Yes sir.
What do you imagine this is?
We are passing through the Bassen Rift. The projections will return when we have cleared it.
Why am I looking at me?
Isolated pockets of humanoids. It appears to be a prewarp civilization at an early stage of industrial development.
I feel nothing Geordi. It is my belief that with my memory engrams he will be able to function as a more complete individual.
Yes.
We have lost structural integrity on decks twelve through seventeen sections four through ten.
What is our approximate distance?
Its you.
No.
Really Captain it was a lovely toast.
The B9 is like a slow child sir. And Data in his own way has assumed the position of a parent or guardian. Im afraid he has expectations based on his own experiences. Hell be disappointed when the BI9 cannot meet those expectations.
Sir the strongest sense I had was that hes more than urious about you. He very much wants to know you.  The same way you want to know him.
Shinzons Viceroy seems to have the ability to reach into my thoughts. Ive become a liability... I request to be relieved of my duties.
How can you be certain?
Captain Picard Commander Donatra of the Warbird Valdore. Might we be of assistance?
The Empire considers this a matter of internal security. We regret youve become involved.
Its very faint but Ive isolated it to the third planet in the Kolarin system.
I thought Thalaron radiation was theoretical.
Geordi put 211 power to the engines.  Take it from life support if you have to  everything you can give me.
Prepare for a sitetosite transport.

To find the head sir?
Whats this?
Diverting to the Kolarin system takes us awfully close to the Romulan Neutral Zone.
I think its worth a look. Dont worry Number One well get you to Betazed with time to spare.
Captain I hope I dont have to remind you 
Its working.
Oh boy. Destroy humanity and the Federation is crippled.
The Titans a fine ship will. And shes getting a captain worthy of her.
Anything.
On the world I come from theres no light. No sun. Beauty isnt important. I see now theres a world elsewhere.
You know I need to verify this.
Romulan ale  Im surprised. I cant stand it.
For thousands of years the Romulan Senate has met in this chamber and dictated the fate of its sisterplanet... But the time has come for us to live as equals.
I want to know  where I come from. The Remans gave me a future. You can tell me about my past.
Were we always explorers?
So Im not as tall as you expected?
Its about destiny Picard. About a Reman outcast who...
You cant trace my holographic emitters Captainn. So dont bother. And you cant contact Starfleet. Were quite alone.
Yes.
Thats your life... not mine.
Well that sounds relaxing too.
The bond is broken.
What is it? Focus on your job
How many Warbirds will you need?
But surely...
Then I dont understand the reason for the delay
Then perhaps you will enlight en us?
Benny God take it easy...
What can I do for you folks?
Credit card.
Were only going to be here a few hours...
Do you have a good map of Death Valley?
Food. Eat. I prepare food. I work as a cook. Thats how I make money.
None. And theres another one in the area thats alive. I dont know if its the only one. I dont know if it was left here by accident or its part of an inva...
Well were in pursuit of a green Mustang...
I dont like it George...
Its messy... the things got a gun... Were just asking for somebody to get killed...
Were growing very concerned back here. Theres no use pretending otherwise. Were rapidly approaching a condition red. People are beginning to ask difficult questions.
I dont care where youre from you just cant disappear into thin air.
Im not being unpatriotic and Im doing my damndest to catch them. Bells up on 80 and Im down here on 70 past Grand Junction. Theyre heading west. If theyre not flying we have a damn good chance of getting them. All Im asking is that you people think about it.
Hello George.
Whats all this for?
George... Do you hear me George?
I just retired.
Mr... Im sorry what was your name again?
Mr. Shermin Im hanging up now. If you want to ask me any questions call me at home in a couple of days. Im in the book.
What?
Ah... no...
What?
Steering wheel... gear shift... dashboard...
What?
Go.
What?
Are you from up there? Space?
Shit.
I will see it next time.
When do you have to be here?
Sun...
Youll keep the car. Ill take a bus...  Am I going up there with you... in your ship... up there?
No... The closest...
What is hitchhike?
Right. In Omaha the driver will put you on the bus for Salt Lake City and the new driver will take...  ...this part. When you get to Salt Lake City ask the driver Las Vegas please...
When do I get to Lathrop Wells?
Yes.
Nobody knows.
You can have one.
Were not going to get a ride tonight.
What are you saying?
Lets find a place out of the rain. Im sure well get a ride in the morning.
You are cold.
What?
Hello... hello. How are you this morning?
No they dont talk... We talk to them.
Oh youre pretty...
The cook again?
Itll give you the different countries how they came to be what they are now how America came to be the governments the languages... everything.
What will you say about us?
How long will it take you to get home?
Where do you think youre going?
Jesus Christ You crazy people...
Help me
I told you Im looking for someone.
Why wouldnt he want to go through the roadblock?... What did you guys do?... I wont tell anybody.
Aghh... Im supposed to umpire a little league game tomorrow.
Thats because the ones that were hurt died. They couldnt talk to you.
Theres nothing... No reports of sightings or landings or anything... in the other parts of the country or overseas... Seems like a totally isolated incident.
To the same woman?
Where are you going?
Good job neither do I. What do you do for a living?
Is there a reward in this?
Eh... the store tells you to call when theres trouble so they wont get sued... But that shouldnt matter if theres a reward right?
All the roads into Death Valley are blocked. Wed like to talk to you.
Come on lets go I got to get back.
Some tips.  Dont dart your eyes around.  Dont look in the mirror or youll ID yourself.  OK?  You got a half hour of tape so give me some leadin to the main event.  But dont wait too long I dont want to be going out for popcorn.  And dont act natural.  Dont act at all. Just forget the thing is on.  Got it?
Hes no concern of mine as long as you dont talk to him.  Dont talk to anybody.  You understand?  Not with everything thats going on right now.
Look Tran... Lenny just came by to give me some bad news.  An old friend of mine has been murdered. You remember Iris?
You said you were going to get her out of this.
Hi baby.  Ive missed you.
He has his uses too.
You have to get out of here.  If Tran catches you hell... hes acting crazy.  Hes doing way too much playback and hes getting completely paranoid.  Hes such a control freak hes even paying Max to follow me around.
Yeah for about a month now.  Lenny just stay away from Tran okay?  And stay away from me.  Stop trying to rescue me.  Those days are over. Im a big girl now.  Stop trying to save me okay because I dont need saving... Just... give up on me.
Youre crazier than I thought Lenny.  Coming here... Trans just in there.
Who did it?
You see the look on that preppy pukes face?  Fuckin pissed in his Topsiders.
Im telling ya its over.  We used it all up
Lets work it.
Hes in this somehow... I dont know how.  Just stay close to Faith.
2203.  Got it.  Stay on her.
Ill have that.  Glock 22.  Nice.
Only he doesnt know about me and Faith.  So I say to myself if I turn the job down he just gets somebody else.  And I lose Faith... to coin a phrase.  So to buy time I do the skank.  I still gotta do something about Tran... I figure its him or me... but I cant cap him without a chump to take the fall.  And who better than his girlfriends loser exboyfriend... a known criminal... who has been seen hassling them in public numerous times.
Dont have a fucking coronary Lenny.
I dont deal blackjack clips  Its policy.  I got ethics here.
I said that?  Look Ill take it for five and youll make out okay because in this case its pure cream you dont have to cut anything back to the wearer.
Iris man.  Pay attention.
I dont know man she wouldnt let me see it.  Said I wouldnt want to see it.  She said she was going to give it to you to hold for her. Like insurance or somethin
I always do.
Greetings gents.  So lets hear this weeks sad story.
Jeez youre pathetic.  Okay I got a pickup at the St. James.  Ill take you there you can get a cab.
What the fuck are you doing?
I thought we were friends.
Macey... Ive never seen you like this.
What is it?
Blackjack?  I dont understand
Cause youre the man right?  The Magic Man.  If its got something to do with the wire sooner or later it washes up on your beach.
Uh unh.  No way  Theyd crucify me.
If he could do whats on that tape hes a sicko.
And what about the guy that was following me?
Hows Zander?
Lenny have you lost it completely?
Lenny give them the tape.
Shit
Those two guys were cops.
So lets see Ive got Trans goons some squidhead psycho and the LAPD all trying to kill me.  Happy new year Lenny.
Theres a plus side?
The only card we have to play is the tape.  You know we get it to the media somehow...
Whatya mean?  Were going  Trans gonna do her right there unless
I worked Vice Narcotics... Violent Crimes... and I saw every known depravity.  I was lost Mace.  In outer darkness.  Then I busted this strungout little teenyhooker. When I met Faith she was just another runaway giving twenty dollar blowjobs to buy crank.  Another lost soul.
But she was different.  There was a light in her eyes... and she had this voice.  It was scary all that pain coming out of that little body. Like she could take all the hurt and rage of the entire world and lift it up to heaven in one voice.  I helped her.  And I promised her that Id always be there... to protect her.  See?  Its not about whats in her head.  Its whats in mine.  I cant let go of the promise.  Its... like... its all I have left.
Got your ticket?
You see Tran?
Alright.  Were going up.
Well...  Get going.  Youre still bleeding.
Were going to aunt Ceciles honey. Were going to watch fireworks from there.  Lets go.  Chop chop.
Problem is Lenny knows everybody.
Was this him?
Testa?
Agents Duncan Mackelway.  Anything new?
Anybody talk to the press?
Agent Mackelway.
Oh Jesus Sheriff I am sorry. I meant to call you  I got distracted  the Sumpter girl was not one of Specks victims. Thats the good news.
Shows over boys. Nobody home.
Hi there.
You have the body?
A grill pattern.
Be my guest Agent Kulok scrub suits are in the back.
There seems to be a discrepancy.
You cant imagine how many men have told me that.
You... surprised me.
Ah... restaurant supplies. I didnt get your name.
Yeah.
What?
Ive been looking for you.
Deputy Director get out sir.
Mackelway I could understand. He is overemotional by nature but you Agent Kulok you had a shining career in front of you.
Look sorry. Dont say a word.  I know this is improper. Ive been trying to speak with Deputy Director Koessler. I left a message. I must speak with you before you go back to Washington.
Its called insubordination.
We had every reason to believe he was on that plane. He was supposed to be on the plane. Everything was incinerated it was two weeks before we reached the crash site. We the Director and I decided it was in everyones best interest to declare Dick Low dead. That way he could exit a hero.
Dunlevy said there was another case Ron Rice. In fact there were two earlier cases where serials were murdered. The second was George Sheldon. I didnt enter it into VICAP  Ill get you the file.
You didnt tell anyone where you were?
Hes got you believing in Zero now too.
Have you told Richard Low about Amarillo?
Hawkins isnt the target Richard Lows the target.
You are so fucked up.
Thanks for the ride.
You used to be in the Behavioral Science Unit right?
Doesnt fit.
Yes I do.
Relax.  J. Edgars greatest fear a female with a badge.
People end up in occupations for a reason. They may think not but they do occupations define us.
Whats that?
Look at this fellow... or this one.
None. Cant find a thing. Nothing on file nothing online. Its not a part of any known killers signature.
Its a nono.
Ive been thinking about this.
Hes called a couple times.
Mack Im sorry. I apologize. I should have called. I had no right to sneak in on you like that.
I came over because I couldnt sleep and was lonely. I wanted to see you. I thought Id surprise you.
And nobody else can do that?
Hello?
This feels like something out of a spy novel.
Probably. I told him Koessler had ordered the report kept it secret.
Id be real careful if I were you.
But why this pattern?
Tom you okay?
You okay?
Zero abducts victims all over the country kills them keeps them refrigerated for days weeks even months then buries them hundreds thousands of miles away. Karen Sumpter was buried washed up in a flood. Evans was buried. When we get Zero well find boneyards all across the country.
Okay Ill unhook you. No weapon.
Bitch Cunt Please please please dont do this Agent Kulok. You need me.
Dave Koessler must have you jumping through hoops.
What was your weakness sir?
Suspect Zero?
Its my master list of missing persons men boys girls children over the last ten years. Two hundred and eightyfive names. A pool of possible victims.
Reality very risky.
Lionheart what happened?
You want to talk Lionheart or you want to take this a little more personal?
If you wanted a good steak you should have gone to Omaha.
Not everything is imputed to memory. The most confidential stuff is kept top secret hard copy. Why would the Zero file be kept secret?
I want to go live with you.
Leave this room Ill go back with you blow your cover.
Yes sir.
Updating the condition of all Bureau owned vehicles in the southwest sector sir.
Attitude Adjustment Issues  what the fuck is that supposed to mean?
Headed there now. The same shift will be on at noon.
But why attack an Agent?
I dont think you understand.
You have to put things in perspective.
You really should. Life after all is really just a series of challenges...
How are you ladies doing this evening?
Well you know its tough. A lot of traveling. A lot of hotels... but you know its a dream... and the moneys really good. I think I might buy another really expensive imported car after my next gig in Vegas...
Are you sure? Maybe...
Like the quiche?
I like quiche.
What else?
Like if I meet a handsome young man and I wanted to ask him to dance? I can do that?
Did you um did you get that pilot?
...not until you book it...
Its like you looked at my tape. You saw my picture. Why did you call me in? You knew I was twentyfour.
Let me just check on my boy.
Hes so sweet. He really said that?
Can I get you something else? I mean you shouldnt leave without getting something for free.
You have to lay it on the table.
Why not?
Well who represents you back east?
Im sure shell call. Six years is a long time. You dont just break it off cleanly after six years.
Its a rebound.
Ill have to come see you sometime.
...Which one...?
...well it suits you...
Hello?
Hows it going? Its been a while...
Good.  I think about things.
Yeah.
You know us.
It doesnt matter. I think about you every day.
Hi.
So I dont call either way.
Rob I just want you to know youre the only one I can talk to about her.
Theres just something about being Goofy. Any other Disney character would be fine. Theres just this stigma associated with the character.
I didnt mention her once today.
You want to hit the town tonight?
How many strokes?
Ill give you an eight. 
An eight.
Kinda money huh?
Ill get a Dewars rocks... 
I cant get over how cute the girls in this city are.
I cant wait till I actually get to touch one of them.
Oh like that song...
Then why wont she call...?
How did you get over it? I mean how long til it stopped hurting?
By the way the guys back home said she put on some weight.
...which means no one will get there til ten.
Yeah. Here its easier to avoid trouble. Its not like you like in Compton where bullets are whizzing by your head every day. Nobodys mugging you on no subway. In New York the trouble finds you. Out here you gotta go look for it...
...It was six months and she didnt dump...
Hi. This is Nikki. Leave a message. 
Hi. This is Nikki. Leaves a message. 
Excuse me. Were in a bit of a hurry.
Im serious. This is how you do it. Im telling you.
Wake up baby.
Theyre all skanks.
Cut that shit out.
It doesnt matter...
First lets see what happens if we play it cool.
Always baby.
Hey man Im down too you know.
Baby youre money. Youre the big winner.
What an asshole.
Lets go. Im not paying for a room and if we dont leave now well never make it.
I dont think so.
Thats bullshit.
Its just tough after sleeping with someone you love for so long to be with someone new... who doesnt know what I like... and you gotta wear a jimmy...
No man. I need to use the phone.
She asked me what I was thinking about? What should I have done? Lie?
Christy was nice...
I just dont think she liked me in that way.
Tee girls dont go for me the way they go for you.
I hear shes getting real fat.
You guys are such assholes.
What times this party tonight?
Was I money?
Youre not just like fucking with me?
How long do I wait to call?
Guys... Guys... I got it under control.
Oh its on baby...
Is she looking now?
...but its worth the risk. True or false Its worth the risk.
...were not...
...youre so fuckin mmmoney.
...Oh who would jack your fuckin K car? Hes right Sue. You dont need no gat.
...Sue...
Its on...
Its on.
Sorry man.
...One fiftynine Two minutes.
The Don himself is coming to me tonight?
No.  You ask for too much.
You never think to protect yourself with real friends.  You think its enough to be an American.  All right the Police protects you there are Courts of Law so you dont need a friend like me. But now you come to me and say Don Corleone you must give me justice. And you dont ask in respect or friendship.  And you dont think to call me Godfather instead you come to my house on the day my daughter is to be married and you ask me to do murder...for money.
Be my friend.
Eat it its on the table.
Thats all?  Dont you want me to send some people over here?
You take care of Paulie?
Youre on kid...Ill square it with Mom your not seeing her before you left.  And Ill get a message to your girl friend when I think the time is right.
Outside.
Ill think about it.
Good for ten men...
You think well go for that last place?
You look terrible.  I want you to eat well to rest.  And spend time with your family.  And then at the end of the month this big shot will give you the part you want.
Is it necessary?
When I meet with Tattaglias people should I insist that all his drug middlemen be clean?
He was the one behind Sollozzo?
Tom I never thought you were a bad Consigliere I thought Santino a bad Don rest in peace.  He had a good heart but he wasnt the right man to head the family when I had my misfortune.  Michael has all my confidence as you do.  For reasons which you cant know you must have no part in what will happen.
What was this for?
I see you have your Luca Brasi.
Your wife and children...youre happy with them?
Godfather you understand everything.
Don Tommassino.
I know.
Corleone.
What is it?
We hear.  We were told you were a Pezzonovanta...big shot.
Hey beautiful girls
You look wonderful kid really wonderful.  That doctor did some job on your face.
Mike  The party starting
The old man wants you Johnnys here...hes got a problem.
Is the hospital covered?
Tom youre the Consigliere what do we do if the old man dies?
Pop they hit us and we hit them back.
Will you give this letter to Michael.
Hello Kay.  Your fathers inside doing some business.  Hes been asking for you.
Bookkeepers know everything. Roccos men are all a little too good for the jobs theyre supposed to be doing.  They get a little more money than the jobs worth.  Lampones a good man hes operating perfectly.
Why do they bother him on a day like this?
Then Luca turned to the other man...
Tom...Tom Id like you to meet Kay Adams.
If hes your brother why does he have a different name?
Would you like me better if I were a nun?
I dont think so.  You dont want to end up on page 3 of the Daily News.
Why are you so cold to her and Carlo?  They live with us on the Mall now but you never get close to them.
Michael its not true.  Please tell me.
Oh no you cant the old mand be sore as hell if I let you get mixed up in this.
Clemenza?  No I dont believe it.
Mike good to see you.  Got everything you want?
You goddamn dagos.  I do you a favor and take Freddie in when youre having a bad time and then you try to push me out.
I have to go back to New York tomorrow.  Think of your price.
Ill do it. I make a fabulous martini.
What? What?
Hi Tom.
Ill come down.
I like to sail believe me I love to sail Instead I make boats and other people sail them.
I met him in New York.
Im never going back
Good afternoon
Could we sail to Venice?
Thats one job you told me a lot of jobs.
I know. I write like a child.
Means we never shared a bath. Im cold. Can I get in?
Whats the fight about? Thats her fiancee isnt it? Are they blaming him?
Esatto. Im always planning.
Then Ill take it as a compliment.
Ha.
Yesterday youre ogling girls on the terrace today youre getting married. Its absurd.
The funny thing  Im not pretending to be somebody else and you are. Im absolutely honest with you. Ive told you my feelings. But you first of all I know theres something  that evening when we played chess for instance it was obvious 
Come on Frederico do you really have to go back? At least stick around for the Festival of the Madonna.
Im well thank you.
Yes it is.
Yes. Whats the detective hoping to find in San Remo?
And his passport photo? Did you hear? To scratch out your own face like that  can you imagine  the frame of mind youd have to be in?  Ive thought about going to the police but I cant face it. I cant face anything anymore.
Thanks so much for inviting me tonight.
Theres room for a whole libretto on Freddies chest.
Is Mr Greenleaf here?
I have to find a birthday present for Frances. Perhaps you can help me?
I dont know. I dont understand Dickie Marge so your guess is as good as mine.
Well one day Im invited skiing the next day Im not one day were all one family the next day he wants to be alone. You tell me.
Is he here? Are you with Dickie?
Is he really not here?
He was there with someone. So I suppose she must have dragged him  thats not fair. Im going back to Mongi. I think Dickies coming home.  Im going to go home.
Perhaps I shouldnt go either.
I was looking forward to seeing him.
Did Dickies Dad go?
Dickie promised me he would never take off this ring.
But I hope that note goes to New York in your purse for a rainy day.
I told you I knew it
Peter SmithKingsley. Ive heard about you of course  from Marge and Dickie.
Look theres Meredith thingy  whos that Marge?  Theyre in textiles... Meredith   God how awful Ive spent Christmas in her house...
Whats your secret?
The funny thing is Im not Randall either. Im Logue.
As in the Textile Logues. Trying to shrug off the dress. I travel under my mothers name too.
But youre going skiing with us Yankees arent you?
Lets go.
Lets take a Carozza and look at the moon.
Dickie are you with Peter Smith Kingsley? I bet you are. My aunt thought she saw him.
My God.
Peter Im really sorry to put you through this. I just couldnt face going to the police by myself when my Italians so rotten.
Anyway Ive got to the bottom of the delay. Finally. Were waiting for someone from Rome.
Can you imagine if Dickie did kill Freddie what must that be like? To wake up every morning how can you? Just wake up and be a person drink a coffee...?
Im sorry. I was asleep. I must have fallen asleep.
Do you want me to stick around?
Hello. What are you up to?
Plans  good plans for tonight or plans for the future?
What are you talking about  youre not a nobody Thats the last thing you are.
And dont forget. I have the key.
So the Doctor he has to make the    come se dice?
Can we go up? Do you mind?
I really dont want to see anybody.
Thank you.
Some of these guns are like toys but a Smith and Wesson man you can hit somebody over the head with it and it will still come back dead on. Nothing beats quality.  You interested in an automatic?
Nah thisll be fine.
Is there a firing range around?
You want to canvass?
I dont know...
Weve signed up 15000 Palantine volunteers in New York so far. The organizational problems are becoming just staggering.
Travis I never ever met anybody like you before.
Where do you live?
So why did you decide to drive a taxi at night?
What did you do?
Thats really something.
Three in the morning? I dont think so. I have to go to bed early. I work days. It must have been somebody else.
Thats very romantic. Some of your fares must be interesting. See any stars politicians deliver any babies yet?
What hours do you work?
You mean you work seventytwo hours a week.
You know what you remind me of?
That song by Kris Kristofferson where its said Like a pusher party truth partly fiction a walking contradiction. 
The singer?
Travis you havent even played the record?
So you havent heard this record yet?
How are you Travis? I read about you in the papers.
No no please. This fares on me. Please.
Tom come here a moment.  I think this canvas report is about ready to go out. Check it out with Andy and if he okays if have a copy made for the campaign headquarters in every county.  And dont forget to add the new photo releases.
Sure we could run him. You realize hes already head of his block association.
No why?
Oh are you all right?
No why?
As I said he isnt Italian. Besides I thought they just killed them.
Why dont they leave a pigeon instead of a canary?
No this is young  well Im never sure how old Black people are  but anyway he isnt old. Thats for sure.
What is your name? My name is Travis.
Well she was trying to keep her skirt down sort of you know. But it was pretty obvious what she was doing. I mean Christ it was rush hour and the traffics practically standing still.
...he called up the Dispatcher last night. Charlie McCall our dispatcher...
Fuckin OneBall.
Stick up?
Where.
Well... I guess so.
Whats your real name?
Cant you listen to me? Dont you want to get out of here?
Do they drug you?
Dont you want to go?
Can I see you again?
No I mean really. This is nothing for a person to do.
I aint ever been there but it dont seem like such a bad place.
How?
God. I know where they should have a commune for you. They should have a commune for you at Bellevue.
Sure you dont want to come with me?
Nice talking to you Travis.
No trouble with the Hack Bureau?
No I want long shifts.
No.
Are you a Secret Service Man?
Sure Henry. I got it all. Well send you all the stuff all right.
Anything you say officer.
I saw. 20 fifteen minutes. 30 half hour.
Im no cop.
Im hip.
Look a person does a certain thing and thats all there is to it. It becomes what he is. Why fight it? What do you know? How long you been a hack a couple months? Youre like a peg and you get dropped into a slot and you got to squirm and wiggle around a while until you fit in.
You fit in. Its lonely its rough at first. But you fit in. You got no choice.
Stick with Carla.
Thank you.
He says hes leaving the island sir.
Just come and get me sir.  Im tired.
Well yes I suppose ...
John Mason.   Dont be shocked.  I dont have much time.  Please listen carefully  ....
Limp dick?
Mason.  Mason?
Partners?
St. Michaels Church Fort Walton Kansas.  Front pew.  Right leg.  Hollow.
This Luke was a pretty good guy wasnt he?
But if you only went to one meeting why does anyone care? Besides why should it even matter if you were a communist?
What about you Delly?
Youll be fine.  No matter what Leo Kubelsky says youve got a hundred and seventyfive years of American law on your side.  Dont forget that.
And whos gonna run the projector until you get back?  Mrs. Terwilliger?
Tell them Pete.  Tell them...
I think  its worse  now.
Im afraid not.  He looked right at your picture without batting an eye.  But its probably temporary. He got all the way to Lawson so he clearly knew who he was and what he was doing until he hit his head. Im sure itll all come back to him.  It just takes a catalyst.
Do you... remember me?
Me too.
Of course there was a lot more room before they stuck the memorial down here.
You dont have a boyfriend or anyone... you know... like that?
No... you were wearing that suit the last time we went out before...
This is strange.  Do you feel it?
Nine hundred...
Well theres got to be a way...
When did you start smoking?
You tried to once.  It was pretty pitiful.
Huh.  That was nice of me.
Now did you remember that or...
Sir that is true.
Mr. Clyde I remember everything.
Yes it does.
Mr. Clyde do you want to know what I knew then or do you want to know what I know now?  Theyre two different things?
Are you refuting this evidence and your previous testimony?
Do you swear that the testimony you are about to give before this committee of the United States House of Representatives will be the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth so help you god?
Mr. Appleton?  Mr. Appleton?
Well this place sorta reminds me of something.
Like Ernie said were all glad to have you back.
Waitll you see the inside
This is the staff of the Bijou.
Ill be home in a little while Harry.  Dont wait up.
And you have sixtyeight dollars and thirtyseven cents in the bank. Your only source of income are my veterans death benefit of forty dollars a month to which youre no longer entitled since Im alive and these ten dollar a month cash deposits you make.  What are those?
Why dont you two get out there and dance?
Well son I wish I couldve shown you more but this is all thats left.  Just this one reel that never got sent back from a picture we showed here a long time ago. Nineteen twentyfive to be exact...
Luke... what time is it?
Im not happy about this mind you but if I have to go at least Im going in my own bed the same bed my Lily died in and... knowing that my son is alive.  Thats not too shabby is it?
Zackly.
Too bad.  He says Im a communist.
Sides cars right outside.  Ill be seein ya Jer.
Any idea how you got here son?
What is it?
Well his rents past due and he said to call you in case of an emergency.  He lose his job or somethin?
You broke your arm.  You were coming out of a bar.  You were drunk.
They dont want you to testify because youre not a big enough fish for them.  They just dont want you writing pictures for now. Thats all.
Peter Im an agent.  I buy lunches and get deals made for guys like you.  Thats what I do.  Youre a writer.  You write pictures. Thats what you do.  And trust me youll be back doing it again tomorrow morning.
Please sit.
Im... Im not Luke.  Luke is dead. He died in the war.  Hes not coming back and Im not him.  I dont even belong here.  This whole thing started out as an accident and thats all it is.  An accident.
Ancestors?
I suppose.  Thanks.
That sign.  Do you think I could have the room for a single night?
Hi.  Is something wrong? Is that cut beginning to bother you?
I dont understand.
Annie that adds up to a jealous possessive woman.
I see.
I did.
And the second?
Well Mom hes the first to admit it.  He spends half his day in the detention cells at the Hall of Justice.
Yes I did.
Could I have a puff?
Dont you like Bodega Bay?
Mitch likes it very much. He comes up every weekend you know even though he has his own apartment in the city. He says San Francisco is just an ant hill at the foot of a bridge.
Why didnt Annie stay for dinner?
Oh. Where dyou want the coffee?
Weve got an extra room upstairs and everything.
Mitch lets turn back.
And the white house?
I see. How do I get down there?
Thank you.
How much for the phone calls?
What goodll that do? Smokes as bad as birds.
One apple pie You want more coffee?
I thought I saw your car. What are you doing in town?
Across at Brinkmeyers.
Whose side are you on?
How long have you known her?
She was selling birds.
Perhaps Im oldfashioned.  I know it was supposed to be very warm there Mitch but... well... actually... well the newspaper said she was naked.
Its none of my business of course but when you bring a girl like that to...
Yes?
Mother get a rope
Im not very good at this Mitch.
We wont be here.
Well worry about that when we get there.
If I go across to Santa Rosa Ill come onto the freeway much earlier.
No.
Im not this way you know. Not usually. I dont fuss and fret over my children.  When Frank died...  You see he knew the children he really knew them. He had the knack of being able to enter into their world of becoming a part of them. Thats a rare talent.
Because my son is...  My son seems to be fond of you.  And I...  Im not quite sure how I feel about it. I really dont know if I... like you or not.
I couldnt ask you to.
Thats a chimney swift all right.
Theres an ordinance against burning anything in this town unless its...
Is that for Mitch Brenner?
Well where did he go?
Well... yes sir there are.
I understand completely sir.
No sir those are... redbirds.
Yes we call them that too.  Ahhh here we are Lovebirds... 
Oh certainly. Its to protect the species.
Some of them are.
What do you call your lovebird story if not a practical...
So you came up to see Annie huh?
Cant see a thing.
Certainly but...
With... with Annie of course.
Will I be seeing you again?
You were just a poor innocent victim of circumstance huh?
Did you really write a letter to me? Or was that a lie too?
What did it say?
But you tore it up.
I couldnt possibly. I have to get back.
I have several jobs.
Nothing.  I go to bird shops on Fridays.
Last night? What do you mean?
It smelled of the fire.
I got here as fast as I could. Wheres Cathy?
I keep thinking of Annie. 
Where are they heading?
Santa Rosa?
When will they stop?
The power.
I was hoping youd be a little late Miss Daniels.  You see he hasnt arrived yet.
I know. Oh I know.  Ive been calling all morning. Oh you have no idea. Miss Daniels theyre so difficult to get really they are. We get them from India you know when theyre just little chicks and then we have to...
Yes.  Oh my I suppose I should call them again. They said three oclock.  Maybe its the traffic. Ill call. Would you mind waiting?
Yes certainly. 
What do you think they were after Miss...?
I dont know why.
Doesnt it seem odd that theyd wait all that time to start a... a war against humanity?
Have you ever seen a jay protecting a nest?
Sebastian Im not an alarmist.
Help how? What do you want to do?
Im only a student.
You have his promise then?
Good morning Mrs. Marsh.
If he were only that. The mans evil himself. Some day youll know him as MacFarlane knows him  for MacFarlane he was to Knox as you are to him. That brought him close to Gray he roistered with him and drank with him. Aye and Gray even brought him to my door and my love. There is all that between them and more  Burke and Hare and Knox 
That porter was Gray and the gentleman of consequence who couldnt swallow the shame of it  who took my last paltry savings to hire Gray 
Hes not home.
You know how we get the specimens we use for dissection?
And thats why you dont want to be a doctor Fettes?
It was about last night I wanted to talk to you  about the operation on the little Marsh girl.
But you did promise.
I wouldnt do that Fettes.  I wouldnt report it.
Here is where you must watch closely gentleman  closely  it is the very heart of the matter 
I just saw Gray.  What was he laughing at?
See that Fettes?
This is not a woman
Why do you want the white horse to bid you goodday?
Come Toddy  come.  Sit down here with me.
Mr. Fettes and I have professional matters to discuss.
Youre a teacher eh?  Maybe youre afraid to be a doctor Toddy.
Afraid you are not as good a doctor perhaps as you make out to be.
Oh its you Gray. Well come in. Sit down. Have a glass with me.
Did he tell you how thoughts come and how they go and why things are remembered and forgot?
But why Gray? Why?
What did you hear?
A goodday to you Madame Tosspot and would you like a little glass of something before you take your rest? Come with me to my house and Ill make you my guest. You shall have quarts to drink if you like.  Ah how he cozened them.
I dont understand the song. Tell me plain how they did it.
Was the paralysis immediate?
Crony indeed
Fettes  where is Fettes?
Whats been holding me together is the hope that maybe you do go someplace. And Ill be seeing her again soon. Only what will I say? That I was too stupid to find the guy who killed her? That hes down here laughing?
Hey. I said what I saw. Two kids arguing. A guy and a girl.
One chance to tell the truth Tommy. Who is the man with the scar? He planted this in my car.
Fucking Zombie.
Are you out of your fucking mind? Were going to die.
You killed that cop Dutton.
I know who you are.  Thats why you paint your face. To hide.
No...
No. You dont.
You know what Lauren and I were fighting about that night? She had a secret wouldnt tell me...
Its ok its ok...
Erlich gimping around in his goddamn hot rod is not discreet. Ive got reporters asking me how much he made. Ive got the entire force looking at this case now.
Tommy Leonard. The eyewitness in the Corvis case.
Guy dressed for Halloween?
They botched the execution.
An accident Nathan.
You want me to walk a straight line?
Stay in the car. Ill only take a second.
What is it?
It still doesnt mean...
I think I dropped an earring.
Youre in with them.
Stay away from me Stay away
They killed her because she found out.
As though unsure of what hes heard Yes  yes I have.
We had our atomic wars  thousands of years ago.  After that we fought with bows and arrows. Then slowly we learned that fighting is no solution  that aggression leads to chaos.
I gather that your efforts on the official level were not entirely successful.
Such power exists?
Hi Mom
Bobby  I think it would be better if we didnt see quite so much of Mr. Carpenter
I mean  on account of that policeman last night.  You think hes a bank robber maybe? Or a gangster?
Bobby youve been dreaming again.
Are you an FBI man?
Well  Professor Barnhardt I guess. Hes the greatest scientist in the world.
Sure. Right near where my mother works.
You think it can go faster than an F 36?
Maybe four thousand miles an hour. And outside the Earths atmosphere a good deal faster.
You think theyll ever find him?
Mr. Carpenter  what does velocity mean?
What does that mean?
Go to the movies.
Lets not say anything to my mother about this Mr. Carpenter.
Aw gee  we didnt finish our story.
All you have to remember is first find the common denominator  then subtract.
Bobby  have you a flashlight?
What do you want it for Mr. Carpenter?
I dont believe it.
How does he explain that?
Its rather difficult for us to think of another planet as a neighbor.
Perhaps youd rather discuss it personally with the President
Im afraid that would be a little awkward. Its  its completely without precedent. And there are practical considerations  the time involved  the enormous distances.
Before making any decisions I think I should get out among your people  become familiar with the basis for these strange unreasoning attitudes.
Well we could
Im at Bleekers getting an appraisal on that diamond. I thought we might have lunch together.
Helen hes the man from the space ship  I had that diamond checked at three different places. Nobody on earths ever seen a stone like that After what Bobby told us thats enough for me. Why is it nobody knows anything about him? Why hasnt he got any money?
Tom you mustnt   You dont know what youre doing It isnt just you and Mr. Carpenter. The rest of the world is involved
Excuse me. I was just going up to my room.
Im sure Barnhardt can arrange to hide me until the meeting.
But how  how long?
How dare you write on that blackboard  Do you realize the Professor has been working on that problem for weeks?
Your names Carpenter  that right?  Any identification Mr. Carpenter? Drivers license  social security number?
Okay  book him and get him fixed up.  Looks like everybodys goin nuts.
People get hysterical enough they do anything.  Look Mr. Carpenter  if you cant identify yourself I got to send you over to the Army.
May I suggest that you call the Professor?
uIllu have to drive
The nightcrawler.  The bloodsucker.
Should I run him through?
Shut up
Dont  Stop
Whats going on?
Where is she?
With him?
Leave him alone.
I have something to tell you guys.  Not only is my own brother showing systems of being a vampire... but now Im convinced my mothers udatingu one
Oh no...
No Nanook  Quiet
I cant sleep with the closet door open either.  Not even a crack.  Your father doesnt mind though. It could be wide open for all he cared.  I think one of the reasons I divorced him was because he never believed... in the horror... of the ucloset monsteru
Grandpa the Widow Johnson called. She said to pick her up a seven instead of eight.
I guess so.  She said not to be late.
Its early.  Why do we have to go home?
Ocean air
Do you mind?  It was a real scary comic.
Well if were in your way we can just eat peanut butter out of the jar in the kitchen.
Theres nothing wrong with Max.  I dont know why you dont 
Ohmygod...
Not impressed are you?
Yeah.  Runaways mostly.  They come from all over.  Attracted by the boardwalk and the ocean.  Lucy... listen I know I have no right to ask you this... but dont look for another job just yet... I mean besides being the best employee I have... I think youre cute.
This looks terrific Lucy.
Im really sorry Max.
Maybe this is the night where everything finally goes right for a change.
Something the matter?
Let me tell you something about boys.  Theyre like weeds.  They grow best when theyre ignored.
Are you hungry?  Wanna get something to eat?
Ouch.
Youve got to put this on.
Its gone.  I feel it
Grandpa does not own a T.V.  Have you noticed?  Theres no T.V. Santa Carla has no malls no Cineplexes and now I wont even have MTV.  I will not know anything hip happening anymore.
Youre beautiful.
Where are we going?
Then whats the rush?  Youre chasing that girl why dont you just admit it?  Im at the mercy of your sex glands
Mom you hitched all the way to Berkeley once remember?
Lose the earring Michael.  Its not happening.  Its just not happening.
Michael?
What??
No  We cant tell Mom  Please Sam.  Dont tell her.
Its that girl from the boardwalk. Is she one of them?
Sixteen.
Was that dog the Norwegian dog?
Listen to me Garry.  Please...
What you doin?
How you doin old boy?
Somebody broke in.
Childs
I said where?  Whered you go?
Cut that out Copper.  Nauls?  Whats taking you?
Somebodys taken it.  I cant find it
MacReady
... So it crashes and this guy whoever he is gets thrown out or walks out and ends up freezing.
I can get maybe another five or six feet out of it.
Torch them
Palmer you and Copper tie everyone down.  Real tight.
Would that test have worked?
Now hold him.
... Guys as crazy as that could have done a lot of damage to their own before they got to us.
Hold on damn it.  Were getting nowhere... If this bit of Blairs about absorbing and imitating is true... then that dog could have gotten to anybody.
Were a thousand miles from anybody else man.  Its going to get a hell of a lot worse before it gets better.
Put that down
Lets rush him.  Hes not going to blow us all up.
Pure nonsense.  This wont prove a damn thing.
Whats...
What if it doesnt come?
This storm do that?
... Hey somebody  Open up its me MacReady...  ... Come on damn it... The towline snapped.  Been crawling around like a seal out here...
Get back
Magnesium of some type... or some kind of strange alloy.  And those poor dumb bastards had to go and blow the hell out of it.
Somebody else sure as hell thought so.
You hear that?
Its in between us and them  How we going to get back?
Ah... no.
Kalen... Do you have any idea where they take them?
Sir... have you a name?
Regenerating fission reactor you wouldnt understand.  Its power is well beyond your neanderthal cranial capacity.
Send him away.
Yes...
Vox?
Why did they built it?
This has to end.
You took her because she helped me.
She wont remember you.  None of them will.  You will be forgotten. That is how history works.
May I help you?
Youre late.
Admiration?  My my.
Oh dammit I love you  I cant eat I cant sleep I cant think all I do is moon over you and  hum apparently.
Darling.
All right...
Lets walk through the park...
Alex...?
They are rare...  ... Orions belt pointing to the earth 
Heavens look at that now
Alex... people are staring.
Damned if I can keep her out of my equations.
Look at them Philby all alike everyone in an identical bowler hat.  Do you want your students to turn out like them?
The most able inventor I know and you cant tie a simple fourin hand.
Thats absurd 
And your jewelry too.  I guess we could consider this your first little bump on the road to married bliss.
Youre up  You must be feeling better 
His curiosity is amazing.
Its hard for me to imagine a better place.  Where I come from theres so much... frenzy.  Day and night.  It seems were all running faster and faster...  ... All in identical bowler hats.
That machine 
Is he all right?
You seem fascinated by the stars.
Yes.
This is magnificent...
This is where my journey started... right here.
Kalen...
Oh Im already swooning.
Yes sir he 
All right Mrs. Watchit.  You can go.
As I recall the syllabus the name of your tutorial is Applied Mathematics and Engineering am I correct?
And roosters.
My equations are not parlortricks
He said he traveled for two months.
To live in.  Theres a lot of us... beyond the valley.
I found you.  I saved your life. You were bleeding all over the place
Well see about that.
Kalen its all right Im here 
Hello Mrs. Watchit.  Youre looking in the pink.
I wonder if that poor girl has any idea what shes in for?
Should we be...
Im just looking at you. Does that make you uncomfortable?
I dont know better. All I know is that you left me in there.
We were forced to use restrains if thats what youre referring to.
Youre just suffering from delusions that are unfortunately part of your condition.
I didnt dream it. I may have been asleep but it wasnt a dream. BECKER sits down in a CHAIR halfshrouded in the light.
And whats that?
Becker how do you sleep at night?
Who are you?
No. I didnt. I swear I didnt. I probably helped push you to kill yourself but I didnt do it.
The three of you werent regular patients. You were criminals that ended up at Alpine Grove.
Thats right Goddamn youre the spitting image. I didnt know he had a son.
Were late.
You look like youve lost some weight. Are you eating?
Im sorry I cant tell you more about your fathers death Mr. Starks. Our own medical examiners determined only that he died from a blunt trauma to the head but that was right around the time the Alpine Groves staff changed and Im afraid we didnt have the best record system before then.
Im sorry? Your face looks awfully familiar I just cant quite place it...
Your mom take anything before this happened?
But I like it I guess.
I think I can remember whats on them.
Jackie Im William Starks. I can prove it.
Howd he die?
The Jacket. Thats what they call it right?
Beat You bled to death.
How? Did they figure it out after I died?
I dont believe a thing she just said.
Maybe. I dont know. Seems more likely Becker does but at the very least she knows how I died.
Me too.
Theyre not here.
What? What are you thinking?
Then why isnt there anyone around?
Theyve got lives to be grateful for.
Thats all you got from him? That bastard helped take your life away from you.
Whats happening to me? Why am I getting so much weaker?
I think so.
Just a little when we were looking up information about Williams father. How did he help?
Because Becker resigned after the charges brought against him by State Patient Advocacy Groups.
What case?
Well do you think Dr. Becker would have any idea?
You dont understand.
Ok fine. Tell me about it. Tell me about the future. 2004. What does it look like?
Some part of you suspects  even if you dont know for sure  that what Im saying is true.
Im not gonna let that happen.
Hes having absence pronounced absance seizures when he stares off into space like he does. He has them so often that thats why he hasnt learned to speak properly.
Thats Kingsley. Old bastard hears us Im sure. He just doesnt want to bother answering so he makes us think he cant talk. I know. I tried it on my mother for two months once before she fished out my tongue. Literally. Beat Youre the cop killer right?
Yeah well 30 times probably would make you seem crazy.
Mortalitys actually a great thing to be familiar with. It means youre sane on some level.
Its worse than war. Its worse than anywhere youve ever been.
Can you drive?
No.
Great. That was our last option. What am I going to do with you?
Where are you going? Youll freeze out there. You dont even have a coat.
This is a great song.
But hey who can forget those words? The man just wants simple and good things for his woman  that she be warm and happy. How hard can that be to remember?
Hon.
You want anything special for dinner?
Honey?
Do you think you could ever think of a set of circumstances that would just cause you to haul off and shoot someone?
Im asking you seriously Sarah a stranger?
Thats what everybody says.  Only problem is nobodys husband was unaccounted for that night... Could you shoot Eddie in the face?  At point blank range?
Who do you think did it?
Weird.  Got some kind of snowball effect goin here or somethin.
Youre gettin in deeper every moment youre gone.
Alright.
Is this the guy you saw them with?
What kind of gun was it?
Its just not working like this.  We gotta do something.  Itd be one thing if these girls were hardened criminals but Jesus Hal this is makin us look bad.  I dont know... maybe theyre not movin.  Maybe that little creep lied.
Well if you dont mind me sayin so he sounds like a real asshole.
Louise is that you?
Well I guess Id better...
I dont know.  Nowhere.  What are you doin?
What did ya do?
Hey peaches.
So whaddya think.  I mean... I could... uh... get a job.  Of some kind.  I mean youve been tellin me that for years right?
Dont worry darlin.  Ill say I never found you.  Ill say anything you want.  Well find a way to get you out of this whatever it is.
Well wait now.  I still have to ask Darryl if I can go.
I dont know.  Warm stuff I guess. Its the mountains.  I guess it gets cold at night.  Im just gonna bring everything.
Ive never had the chance to go out of town without Darryl.
Cause I didnt ask him.
I havent seen a place like this since I left Texas.
Thelma
Alright...  I changed my mind.  Ill have a margarita with and a shot of Cuervo on the side please.
So Jimmy still hasnt called yet?
Im sorry Louise.  I know youre all upset.  Its just Im so excited to be out of the house I guess.  I wonder if Darryls home yet.
Oh my God.
Shouldnt we go to the cops?  I mean I think we should tell the police.
All of it.  That he tried to rape me.
It means shut up Thelma.
Were gonna go to the next town and stop.  Well get a motel room.  I can rest for a while and then figure out how to get some money.  Were gonna need money.  Thelma.  How much money do you have with you?
Oh I dont know.  Im just nervous. I gotta figure out what to do.
What do you mean?
Dont get mad Louise but where are we going?
I called the asshole at 400 in the morning and he wasnt even home.  I dont know what hes got to be mad about.  Im the one who should be mad.
Well it looks like we can get on this road 81 that heads down towards Dallas then cut over to...
So what are you gonna tell him?
What happened to your hair?
Holy shit.
No we shouldnt but I want to put some distance between us and the scene of our last Goddamn crime
So whats the plan Thelma?  You just gonna stay drunk?
Thelma.
Just stop talkin to people Thelma Stop bein so open  Were fugitives now.  Lets behave that way
Can I ask you kind of a weird question?
Oh yeah.  You mean Peekapoos.
What?
I told you to slow down.  Hell Officer I told her to slow down.
I know its crazy Louise but I just feel like Ive got a knack for this shit.
Well I figure if you take a state policeman shoot up his car take his gun and lock him in the trunk its best to just get on out of the state if you can.
I dont want to see any more beef jerky.  I mean the next beef jerky you hand me is going out the window. Its drivin me crazy.  The whole car smells like it.
What?
I said all that?
Thelma that is not an option.
You awake?
Well be drinkin margaritas by the sea Mamasita.
We should head a little further in. Theres not that many roads in this state.  I want to try to hit Mexico somewhere not so close to New Mexico.  They probably wanna kill us in New Mexico.
Oh my God  Louise  Look  Look See if thats him
I guess we shoulda made some kinda plan for what to do if we get caught.
What?  What dyou think?
Youre a good friend.
I guess everything weve got to lose is already gone anyway.
What in the hell is that up there?
Go.
We been seein you all along the way.
You women are crazy
Were fine  How are you?
Where you goin?
Smatter with you? You look like youre fading.
Heavy? Heavy? What I wouldnt give to know what heavy feels like you insensitive prick.
Well uh can you tell us his name?
Did you get my letter Mare? The one about Ted?
Look at me Mary. On my mothers soul on God above on everything that is holy to me I did not steal your shoes.
...Not until I get a little something to remember you by.
Nah.
I mean since then.
What if youre wrong? You just said shes the only girl you ever loved what have you got to lose by calling her?
Youre kidding? What did they say?
I dont know about this Dom.
Never met him.
Got cash.
You know clean the pipes.
Whys that?
Dom Wooganowski. Duh.
Uhhuh. Where was he?
Who?
You mean he doesnt like bad guys.
Were in love with your roommate.
You should thank me  that girl was not easy to find. Whatd she scam you out ofsome insurance dough?
Very nice.
Okay? With this pad the killer wheels? Looks like you really cleaned up your act.
Uh Im fine. Just wanted to let you know Ill have your car back in a couple hours Im still staking out this girls apartment.
So where the hell are you Healy?
Oh yeah.
Not in months. I dont even know why I bought the damn place.
Well it was nice meeting you again.
What are you doing with all these blueprints?
Thats what I said so I went out and got him a leash you know one of those clothesline runners for the backyard. Hes got plenty of room out there to dig. The kids really blossomed. Now I can take him to ball games movies  you know happy stuff.
Oh Pufferball likes his little tum tum rubbed doesnt he now?
Sorry Pat out of beer. You like vodka?
The museum? I thought we were going out to dinner?
I know hes around here someplace.
Would you call that a portico or a vestibule?
How about  ?
That grandmother of yours  shes really something.
Lint?
Try to be. Its tough going with the crap they make today. If Dumb and Dumbers the best theyve got to offer I say thanks but no thanks.
I guess.
Mary ah forget it.
Are you okay?
All you want is a phone number?
Sure she is. Thats why she got an unlisted number and you havent heard squat from her in a dozen years. Oh youre good Ted. Youre a real piece of work.
I get one hundred a day plus expenses.
Right there in Liberty City. And you were right shes really something.
Nope. Never been.
Dont look so shocked its been a long time. I bet youve changed a lot over the last twelve years havent you?
Miami?
Well I think youre right I should look her up.
Marys a mailorder bride?
Well you didnt have to blow us both out of the water. Jesus Christ just because she found out about you whyd you have to take me down with you?
Among others.
Well Ill tell her I ran into you.
You know I really should take your card.
That stalker Ted got to you right? Youre working for him arent you you little shit?
I mean Im a fucking fraud. Im no architect. Dont be a putz  whos been to Santiago twice in a year?  Estadio Olimpico  please
What line? The day you first laid your oily rap on my future wife you started a war
Id go with the seven.
Yeah and youd probably dump the poor guy halfway to Katmandu.
What? Steve seemed to put up with Warren.
Neighborhood Watch? Is that what you call listening in on strangers phone conversations?
Good lookin?
Holy shit...
Magda
Hes a nice guy isnt he?
Magdas right Im so lucky to have you in my life.
By the way hows he doing?
Actually its Mary Brooks now.
You look great.
Now by killer you mean...?
Jeez Mary... Im...
You hit the ball pretty good for a fourteen.
We should play some time... I mean if you can afford to lose some money.
You know what Id like to see? Meat in a cone. You could put corned beef hash in a cone or chopped liver.
Ted... youre not that far ahead.
What what are you doing here?
Yeah? What do you want?
Is it the frank or the beans?
One guess.
Youre looking at him. Cmere and take a look at this beauty.
Were here Warren. You wanna get off?
Which is exactly what they appear to be preparing to do Mr. President. Were tracking 26 ships inbound to Cuba. Theres no sign theyre changing course. The closest ships the Gagarin and the Kimovsk will make the quarantine line by this time tomorrow.
I believe the President made it clear that there would be no firing on ships without his express permission.
This was not the Presidents intention when he gave that order. What if the Soviets dont see the distention? What if they make the same mistake I just did?  There will be no firing anything near ANY Soviet ships without my express permission is that understood Admiral?
This private assurance represents the word of the Highest Authority?
Hes right Jack. Taylor is saying we may have some time. Weve got to use it.
As if dealing with the Russians wasnt hard enough we gotta worry about our own house.
Lying bastard. Lied to my face.
We have to pull him. Hes not going to be able to handle the Soviets in front of the U.N. Zorin will eat him alive.
Were going to have to stop a ship eventually show the quarantines got teeth or well prove McCone right.
Jack Im as conniving as they come but a sneak attack is just wrong.
Oh still sore about this.
The Jupiters are obsolete. They were supposed to have been dismantled last summer anyway 
Hey Mac. Youre up bright and early.
Jack and Bobby are good men. But it takes a certain character moral toughness to stand up to 
How long until the army is ready?
Guess we cant blame Khruschev for a few patriotic farmers. And the ships?
Then we have no choice.  General issue the warning orders to our forces. They will be prepared to execute the air strikes Monday morning and the followon invasion according to the schedule thereafter. Ill need the official release orders on my desk Sunday night.
Kenny What happened? They didnt let me up front said the President was on the phone the whole time.
There are major rail disruptions in the South two airborne divisions are on alert. That exercise is an invasion.
So whatve we got today?
Didnt know Adlai had it in him. Too bad he didnt have this stuff in 52.
They know each other Khruschev and Feklisov aka Fomin were war buddies
Dont take it to court but weve got good circumstantial evidence...  Walter agrees. My guts telling me Khruschevs turning to a trusted old friend to carry his message.
Moving the line. Stroke of genius.
You must think Im blind and stupid. Ive already gotten the birds and bees from Bobby. The President doesnt have to doublebarrel me.
At least it will expose whether Khruschev has been overthrown. Well know what were dealing with.
Dangle a settlement tie us down in negotiations we come up short...
Bob?
Captain force the sub to the surface for inspection.
Heroes aint supposed to shake. Im shakin man look at me.
Jesus Christ Larry what the fu Larry. Thats not even your name is it? Whats your real name you fucking scumbag?
Mr. Clear Moon.
Now keep that between us Dennis cuz I dont know what kinda Johnny Law they got here.
Brooks whats a perceptive fellow like you doing in a joint like this? Let me buy you a glass of some of that Russian shit you like.
You know how in your big cities you got your niggers and you got your Puerto Ricans? Well out here we got Indians. Thats just the way it is.
Taking ol Leo somewhere?
We got the wire ya was comin. Youre the Indian official yeah?
 an Indian Reservation is within the jurisdiction of the Federal Bureau of Intimidation. I know that.
 violation of the Major Crimes Act on an Indian Reservation is within the jurisdiction of the Federal Bureau of Instigation. I know that.
What the hell you doing?
Were you in Nam?
Leos gonna need his hands Cooch. He does quillwork.
Whatd she say?
Thats good goddamn work Ray. Let the salmon run. Let em run Upriver.
Your first homicide thats gonna happen Ray...
Ill sleep around a little.
Eagles claws and a bears balls thats what her profile says.
Tread matches. Its the car.
Jesus you alright?
We were sworn in on the Constitution to protect federal matters Ray. I dont know about uranium I dont know about Red Dog Table  all I know is we did our job. Its over.
What?
Big sonuvabuck. Based on the depth of that print pressure releases... Id say he goes twoten twofifteen 
Go back to the M.E. take a look inside Leos exit wounds and tell me how chicken feed got in there. Trust me there aint chickens in the Badlands. His mothers place is 
Grandpa Samuel Reaches. Heavy duty medicine.
What did he say?
Listen to the water. Listen to the owl. He also said dont trust the fucking Cookie Monster.
Dont be mad. That was just an old traditional gesture that means hello how are you.
Thats not solid.
The old man? Hes gonna tell you who killed Leo?
I cant do that  Its a Rolex.
I cant be dicking around here. Thats all Im saying. I dont carry crystals I dont wanna come back in another life. I just wanna do my job and do it right and get the fuck outta here.
Next time Ill be ready. You get the word to who ever it is.
Fivehundred year old turtleshell rattle...
Wheres Maggie? Whered ya take her.
You had a vision. You had yourself a vision. A man waits a long time for a vision. Might go his whole lifetime and never get one. And along comes some instant Indian with a Mastercard and brandnew shoes has himself a vision.
Maybe it was just a dream. Ya know just one of them what do ya call em fitful dreams?
Thats what were doing here. National interest. National security. Only this time its not gold. Its uranium.
Alright. Shits comin down. Hes callin council fire. All the old chiefs and the warriors too. I gotta be at Grandpas place in two hours. We need to get the tribe together. We need to block this thing.

No plates. No registration. Serial numbers removed. And all prints washed off by the river. Thats great. This is turning out to be a walk in the park do you know that?
Yellow bird... is gonna sing.
Im not that sure. Yeah I think 
Since I got a iron pipe put across my knees man. Fight with three wasicus ya know.
Get up out of the chair and walk toward the backdoor Richard.
Ill bet
How so?
Where did you see that?
The what?
What would?
I dont mix with the boys. I work here. Lets keep it professional.
Lieutenant...
Whyd you do that?
You know what really scares me? Living too long. Losing my hair and my teeth...and my guts and my wind. And my brains...Sitting in a room with my hands in my lap watching daytime TV.
No fooling on base no signs no comments no talk. By anyone.
No.
You dont believe that.
Want to play the game?
Goose is dead.
Looks like a tie.
Well... What   is   it?
Tomcats?
Cant shake him.
Ive got a six strobe.  I think hes locked on us.
Thats missile lock

Hey if it was easy everybody would want to come up here and do it..... Instead of just us.
WHAT? WHERERE YOUHEY WHERE IN THE HELL ARE YOU GOING?

Helping him in.
You didnt help.
Its my own way. It works for me. I dont care about the rest of that stuff.
I called your house.
VF 51 the Oriskany. You remind me of him. Youre just like he was only better...and worse.
So where to?
What happened to number five?
Never mind.  Wet a towel and wrap it around your head.  Thatll muffle the signal.
Nice to have you back with us Mr. Brubaker.
Would you like the same suite?
Thats what we wanted you to think. The fact is Hauser volunteered to become Doug Quaid. It was the only way to fool the psychics.
What are you afraid of?  Turn it on.
I say we throw the switch and see what happens.
Kill him.
Listen to me  Hes been going on and on about Mars.  Hes really been there.
Your sexual orientation?
Demure aggressive sleazy?  Be honest.
What do you want?
Ya know Doc you could have folled me.
Mr. Quaid can you hear yourself? Shes real because you dreamed her?
Suppose I do...then what?
Mr. Cohaagen wants to see you right away.
Richter  Call from Cohaagen.
Pull them out.
If we dont hand you over everybody in the sectorll be dead by morning.
They sell fake memories.
No shit...
You shoulda listened to me Quaid. I was there to keep you outta trouble.
I want that fucker dead.
What was that?  I couldnt hear you.
Ive got a lock  There
Welcome to JohnnyCab.  Where can I...?
Lets do it.
Doug maybe we should take a trip.
Well...What do you say?
You are somebody.  Youre the man I love.
What are you doing?
I know it sounds crazy but I went to this Rekall place after work and...
You call this a paranoid delusion?
But Doug...Theres something I want you to know.  Youre the best assignment I ever hand.  Really.
As real as any memory in your head.
All right.
Im not interested in that.
Ooo whatcha been feeding that thing?
She wasnt really my wife.
What can I do?
Like what?
Cohaagen knows it makes air.  But the bastard wont turn it on.
Whats wrong?
Okay Burt listen.  Forget shooting them.  Tell me this can you get to your truck?
Yeah like they got a plan...
Miguel the troubles come to us. If were not ready...
Youre not getting any penetration even with the elephant gun.
Knock it off Burt
A beauty isnt it?  We bought three of them for the rec room.
What the hell you doing back already?
Burt get out  Get up on your roof or someplace  We found out whats been killing people  Theyre under the ground
Thats fine.  Weve got some new things to teach them.
Jesus Christ were only going nine miles.  Be there in two hours tops
BACK OFF BURT...
Theres nothing like them in the fossil record Im sure...Okay so they predate the fossil record...  Thatd make them a couple of billion years old...and weve just never seen one till now.  Right.
Hi guys.  Burt loaned me his camera.
Uh...Digging that waterhole for Nestor.
Who the hells that?  Thats not whats his name...the grad student?
Well uyoureu the one wont work in the car wash.  Youre the ones gotta have a plan.
Jeez look at that guy.
Oh Jesus
Brother we decided to leave this place just one day too late you know?
Cars gone.  We just missed them thats all.
What the hell are they?
Heres the plan well get a...a flatbed I guess with a big winch figure a five ton anyway.
Well folks whats the plan?
Shut it up  Shut the little bastard up
How the hell long it take uyouu to change a tire?
Its tires are flat...
She likes ubothu of us.  We both helped her out.
Hi guys what you been up to?
Ready?
I brought it... to the coroner.
Youre fishing. You dont know shit.
You would have the court believe that these two bullets were fired from the same gun?
Gimme back my bottle.
Objection your Honor The fact that the witness is currently a patient is immaterial
 Then you dont wish to call any witnesses Mr. Dowd?
You cant come back here... Anything happens to you Im liable.
Look Im a lawyer and 
Hey  the fact you popped Jimmy Chin in broad daylight proves it wasnt premeditated. Juryll sympathize  dude was banging your wife right?
Clyde you wait here.  Glenn got a minute?
Come now. Did you see the gun?
How can you remember that?
We had information bearing on Mr. Kims desire to gain admission into the Joe Boys by assassinating a member of a rival gang.
You see that? You wanna be like that?
I dont venerate drug dealers Roger. To the contrary.
Ten years is a long time.
What other case?
Shoulda told the one about Shu being the bastard child of Mother Theresa.
Eddie Dowd.
Ive heard from the last ballistics expert on the list. Its an even ten who say Shus gun killed Jimmy Chin
 Eddie...
Youre carrying that around like it was a picture of your girlfriend  I dont want to see your heart broken when this case crashes and burns
But Roeders dead. Ballistics says its Shu We dont have one witness  unless we put Cecil Stipe on the stand...
They couldve been brothers. Its why the eyewitnesses picked Shu.
How long did it take Badalato to drive Jimmy Chins body from Chinatown to the morgue?
Do you speak Cantonese Mandarin or both?
Lemme guess. Some corporate V.P.s banging his secretary over lunch and you have to focus your camera and plug in your little tape recorder.
A fucking wheelchair?
 Find him?
No. You tell me Shu.
Quite a bit you didnt tell me.
lo Cecil.
When the D.A. hears I filed the writ hell send someone here maybe claiming to be a journalist. That person will ask you lots of questions. Just be truthful Cecil okay? To all of us?
My staff tells me its been mostly drug pushers... I said that cant be the same Edward Dowd.
Im sorry if Ive ruined your day Mr. Reynard. But my clients had a rough eight years behind bars and 
Fridays the dropdead date on the offer.
Youre pissing me off again Ed.
Isnt it a fact that the six other Asian men in the lineup were all of the classic Mongoloid type whereas Shu has the distinct facial bone structure of a Korean?
To the best of your recollection were you sober when you performed the tests?
In those days they often worked as a team.
I cant be expected to remember the name of every informant eight years after the fact.
You read Eddies Chase Manhattan Bombing summation in the Leftist Law anthology?
Its okay. It was always like that.
Then it was your idea to have Chuckie Roeder scare Eddie off the case?
A Cubano army basically... inside and outside prisons.
Name rank and serial Mr. Ortega. Lets not hide behind the Fifth.
Isnt it unusual for an Asian to be accepted into a Cuban prison gang?
I think what Eddie wants to say is 
What color hair will she have?
Go away. I am not talking to you.
Thats not important. I will tell you what is important. The fan will soon be starting.
No.
No. Never. Youll have to kill me.
Here he comes.
This isnt Mike.  Is this Mike?
Your behavior is not funny and is wasting the time of the Federal Government.
Its 430. We close at five.
What the hell is that thing doing out there? Youre not taking that body anywhere.
Maybe not a thing but maybe two things.
We got a phone here thats got a little ring.
You try that you little monkey.
Phillip?
QUICKLY MEN... WORD ASSOCIATION COOP. WHAT ARE YOU THINKING ABOUT RIGHT NOW?
It was a year ago today that Teresa Banks was killed. Im wondering if the murderer will ever kill again.
Hes dead  good and dead.
No.
There was only one job. Teresa took the job. Her friend took a hike. Never saw her again.
So the sheriff had got an Uncle whos committed a serious crime.
A blue rose.
Why couldnt he have just told you all these things?
I see. He does talk loud.
I doubt it was drugs more likely a problem with a nerve. I could recheck the arm for injuries but for real nerve work we are going to have to take the body back to Portland.
Take a look at this.
I couldnt help but notice that you had a suspicion that Deputy Cliff was the murderer. You did think that didnt you Agent Desmond?
James called me last night looking for you.
Are you going to tell him about that someone else?
You know what your problem is?  Youre just too adorable...
Laura Palmer youre just too adorable.
Are you going to see James tonight?
Okay L.  I am your friend... always. But sometimes... lately... I feel that you dont like being around me because I am so uptight.  No I am uptight. I hate it... I dont want to be this way but Laura I dont... I mean... Im your friend no matter what way you are.
Im in a mess today too.  Im thinking about doing it with Mike. What do you think?
Goodbye Muffin.
Youre not mad at me?
But I love you Laura.
The pages are gone. Thats real.
Did you make me a tape?
Baby you know why? Cause itll never get here.
Thats right. She called me. She even asked me what your fathers looked like...
Were on our way Baby.
Laura do you love me?
You always hurt the ones you love.
Say anything you want... I know you love me and I love you.
Youd think so.
History is on our side Ben. Its no accident that the great explorers were named Hennepin Nicollet Marquette.
Believe me Josie you would not offend the customs of this country. For instance I dont eat fish eyes.
Can I take the car?
Laura.
You lied to me about those school books. I found them upstairs on your bed.
Laura now I cant find that blue sweater. Did you take it again?
If its okay with you Im going to Bobbys to do my homework.
Good night Mom.
Dad.
Sit down... sit down... Are you hungry?
Who was that?
Did you get this from your lover?
Bobby didnt give you this?
Did Bobby give you that or is there someone new?
Oh Leland sit down and eat you dinner.
I dont know.
He was accused of jury tampering.
So what I want to do is stop it here. Im going to make him an offer. I want to do it myself. I want it to come from me.
I know that answer. If we went to trial would we win?
Yes.
That was our insurance companys recommendation.
Thats not my handwriting.
And why please tell us would you think that?
Neurology?
...of Anesthesiology?
Weve touched on this his own witness has said...
Objection
Objection This is ri... expect us to accept a photocopy we have the original right...
Anything special about the case?
Mary Rooney the obstetrical nurse...
...You brought thirty years of medical experience to bear. Isnt that what you did?
...the Archdiocese called up they said who was our attorney cause the case is coming to trial...
You said youre gonna call me up. You didnt call me up. Who do you think you are?  Who do you think you are...?
Cardiac arrest. During delivery her heart stopped. When the heart stops the brains deprived of oxygen. You get brain damage. That is why shes in the state shes in today.
Are you saying that a failure to restore the heartbeat within nine minutes in itself constitutes bad medical practice?
Im sorry...?
Do you know who her doctors were?
Uh why why are you doing this?
Hi.
One hour.
Im sure it is Frank and let me tell you something. If we find it so complex how in the hell you think youre going to make a jury understand it?  See my point? Lets talk a minute. Frank what will you and your client take right now this very minute to walk out of here and let this damn thing drop?
Thats it...?  Come on guys... life is too short...  You tell me if youre playing chicken or you mean it.  Frank I dont think Im talking out of school but I just heard someone offer you two hundred grand... and thats a lot of money... and if I may say you havent got the best of records.
What is it?
I had a witness disappear on me.
Do we have time this morning to...  All right. Mr. Galvin you want to continue now or we can resume with Dr. Thompson this afternoon.
Yes Mr. Galvin?
Listen to me fella...
Maybe I can do something right.
Ive got to work...
You want me to tell you its your fault? It probably is. What are you going to do about it?  I thought its not over till the jury comes in.
Continental Casualty...
Im sorry Sir were not allowed...
I cant guarantee that...
Hello Im calling from...
Pardon?
We find that your subscription lapsed...
Hes the Assistant Chief of Anesthesiology Massachusetts Commonwealth. He says your doctors Towler and Marx put my girl in the hospital for life. And we can prove that. What we dont know is why. What went on in there? In the O.R. Thats what wed like to know. Something went wrong. And you know what it was. They gave her the wrong anesthetic. What happened? The phone rang... someone got distracted... what?
You know what happened.
I can subpoena you you know. I can get you up there on the stand.
Who put my client in the hospital for life.
Im... Mrs. Doneghy? Im Frank Galvin... why didnt you go in?
My doctor told me that I got to move out West... thats when we filed in court. We didnt want to sue...
Well well well. Huh?
...hes a good man...
You got the admittance form says patient ate nine hours prior to admittance.
Right.
So what?
How are you holding up?
What are you doing in New York...?
You have a record of what happened in the operating room...
...there are notations every thirty seconds...
...they start again three minutes earlier...
Brain damage could have been... it didnt necessarily take nine minutes it could have been caused in two...
Yes.
That Frank was working on. Yeah. He thought Franky needed some help so they bribed a juror. So Franky finds out. He comes to me in tears. He thinks that anybody who knows what a spinnaker is got to be a saint. I told him Franky wake up. These people are sharks. What do you think they got so rich from? Doing good? He cant be comforted. He tells the boys at Stearns and Harrington theyve disappointed him hes going to the Judge to rat them out.
That explains why communication is cut the moment their machines begin to move.
Hey you  Better get outa here
Hurry up  Jump in
Did you see it come down?
Im sorry.  I dont smoke.
Aw he isnt that good...
Well you certainly dont look like yourself in that getup  But I am happy to meet you anyway. Im Sylvia Van Buren.  I teach Library Science over at USC.
I almost forget when I ate last.  It looks so good.... You know mostly I get my meals in coffee shops and restaurants.
No on the campus.  I havent any family.
A big family must be fun...I imagine it makes you feel you belong to something.
Well get safely out of here dont worry.
I stayed right by the door  praying for the one who loved me best to come and find me.  It was Uncle Matthew who found me.
He liked you ... I could bawl my head off
How long was I out?
What was it like?
Howd you guess?
I probably wouldnt be able to get to them if I tried...
This Martian blood...  Lets make a quick analysis and see what weve got
That probably dropped half way to Pomona...What do you think?
Whatll we say to em?
I thought hed stopped doing horror.
Which means hes having nightmares again?
Sweetie youve got lots of fans weve done market studies.  You rate right up there.  Weve already got Chase working on a prototype for the glove.
Dylan its breakfast.  Not arts and crafts  What?
No you dont.
What if it isnt over?
Heather?
Someones coming.
Rex saved me.
...as soon as the sun was up the witch made Gretel fetch the wood and kindle a fire.  We will bake cookies first she said.  I have heated the oven and kneaded the dough.  Crawl in and see if the fire is blazing high enough now. And she pushed Gretel toward the oven. The witch meant to shut the door and bake her once she was inside.  Dylan this is too violent.  I dont know why you like these stupid old tales.
Hes on his way.
Dylan you go back to sleep now.
In my bed.
You okay champ?
Yes.  Its a story.  A story for a movie.
Mustve read about the funeral.  Sick mother.  Thats the last thing you need right now Im sure.
Youre not crazy by the way.
Seemed not was.
Ive never mentioned it to him.
You got it.  Whats happening?
Youre right.  That sounds crazy
I want to see the body.
Ill call the cops for you.  Youve got the number on the fridge right?
Captured?  How?
The way to stop him is to make another movie.  And I swear to you Ill stay at my computer and keep writing until I finish the script.  But when that time comes...  Youre gonna have to make a choice.
Of course he is.  Freddys dead and gone.
He would have loved this.
All his years at sea he never stopped talking about these islands.
What?
What are they doing?
Oh I was walkin down Lime street one day...
She said None the better you all go to hell...
Well bear off to port and run down wind.
Carry on.
But your instinct was to lose sail?
Okay heres the duty.  Gieg Weathers Lapchick Schucart scrape and paint.  Corry and Stricklin have the brass.  Robinson youre the Galley slave.  March youre on chain gang with Barnes. Johnston solo on bilge detail.
Theres still a way.
When we were growing up I always felt like you would take care of things that everything would be okay.  But you cant make this okay can you?
She isnt that old.
Yeah.
Yeah thats right.  You wanna come in and shake it for me?
They were gonna put me into special ed this year.  I stole a copy of my transcript changed all the grades. Shit who am I kidding.  Ill never pass the boards.
You okay?
That were going back.  I dont want it to end.  I dont want to be what I was when I left.
Who I am outside of this boat. What the hell Im doing here.
You gonna jump?  Or are you just having a last look?
Why then.
He does.
Whyd you do it?
Do you have your ticket?
Goodbye Mom.  Ill be okay.
What the hell is going on?
So... What happened?
Hold her steady into the wind. Southwest by west.
Remember something sooner or later... we all have to face it.
Uh huh.
Chicken is a fools game captain.
But the Captain ordered you hard to starboard.
Is that what you were trained to do?
Your cable said you wouldnt be putting out until midOctober.
Ill be frank with you.  This was his mothers idea.  A romp through the Caribbean on a sailboat sounds more like a vacation than an education if you ask me.
Well we thought wed drop in and see if you were all still in one piece.
Humor me.  Eat it anyway.
Oh really?
And being sixteen.
Whats that?
Jesus.  Shes got guns.
Whats your problem?
Because I felt like it.  What do you care?
How would you know?

Its none of my business but when are you and Marietta gonna tie the knot? I always wondered why you never did.
Alright... By all means. Make yourselves at home.
But how are you finding New Orleans Senor Farragut?
But Im a robber and a manslaughterer and I havent had any parental guidance.
Why are you in New Orleans? If you dont mind my askin.
Would you like to enjoy a martini with us?
Oh Johnnie Farragut... Dont you trust your very own Marietta?
Well stop worryin about me and start worryin about how youre gonna get that Lula back here and away from that murderer.

Youre not tellin me that youre sweet on him?
Im gonna take your silence as a yes...

Well Johnnie told me you used to drive for Clyde and Santos...
Does that girlfriend of yours know that her mama and Santos killed her daddy?  Does she know her own daddy was one of the biggest drug dealers around  till he started snortin the shit himself?...  Does she know you was around that night her daddy was set fire to?
I aint heard of nothin.
Hey pal you dont start doing crazy eights in the middle of the street none of this happens.
Actually... I just want to go home.
Hey. What are you guys doing here?
I like what youve done with it. Whens Captain Nemo moving in?
You all right Professor Tripp?
Oh well thats just it. Shes been coming down here every half hour or so to sort of check on me. If Im not here she might... call the police or... something.
You snore.
Its the Chancellor.
I was explaining to Antonia how a book comes to be published. What you do as a writer what I do as an editor...
You didnt actually purchase this car did you. Trip??
Trip??
Left you...? Who? Emily?
No sexual confusion there eh Professor?
Not Curtis.
And now hes addicted to painkillers.
He lives with his mother.
Groom. Named Claudell. And his mother blames Vernon for his death.
Christ Crabs what do you expect me to do? The kids practically in a coma.
Wait here. Ill be right back.
You stay there.
James? My James? Whats happened?
Crabtree.
Let me get this straight. Jerry Nathan owes you money. So as collateral he gives you his car.
Theres only one problem Tripp. We dont know his real name. We just made it up. In fact we made the whole guy up.
Came to my senses.
No. But I dont think that matters.
No...
Its cool Jeff. Really.
Ive been doing that a lot lately.
She told you about...
Look Mr. Tripp. You have a drug problem all right? On top of that you have a bite on your ankle that is severely infected. We pumped you with antibiotics so youll be fine but another day or two and you might have lost the foot. As for your spells. Im guessing theyre a result of the anxiety youve been experiencing lately.
Let me get this straight. All that paper that went into the river. That was the only copy?
You cold James?
Actually I saw the greenhouse. So I thought... I thought Id come out here and take a look at it. You dont see one of those every day. It looks like heaven...
Theyre glass. The buttons.
Can I ask you something about her?
Looks like... our old friend Mr. Codeine. That should take the pinch out of my ankle.  Have one.
Thank you.
Huh? Oh no. This isnt Emilys. I just write in it.
The guy on the phone.
I think its sort of writing itself at this point.
But... ?
Hows that?
Outside Scranton.
This is so nice. Its like where Andy Hardy would live. Whats it called again?
It feels really... good... here.
Yes you are. My stuff stinks. I know it. You said so yourself.
Thats why youre having them. Your spells.
Im not going with them.
Get out of here.
Professor Tripp...?
So what are you going to do?
Actually Hes not the Chancellors  What?
The aunt Hannah. Where did you take James that day?
I uh I didnt finish I... fell asleep.
I got the message you called.
And? Are you going to tell him?
Sara my arm. Im stuck honey.
Not have it.
You heard? How?
Are you limping? Why are you limping?
Whats he doing out there?
Sara.
You didnt happen to call the house last night did you Grady?
And what do you think you might have said?
I went and looked at some babies just now.
Did you tell Walter?
Does he still love you?
Did you just make that up?
Listen Antonia 
Whos this ?
I know its you Grady I just... Christ Grady do you know what time it is?
Say Professor Tripp is all that stuff true about Errol Flynn? How he used to put coke on his dick. To make himself you know like last longer?
Do you get high Sam?
Holy shit. Are you serious?
Yes. Hes a good kid. Maybe a little messed up.
I  just wanted to see her I guess  Emily. And to see you too  you and Irene. And to let everyone know that even though it may be difficult to comprehend now this  everything thats happening  its not forever. It doesnt mean Goodbye.
You look good damn good considering youre an old man now
Hey is that a school?
Its made from cherry. Thats a hard wood.
She was going to throw it out wasnt she? Just toss it like a scrap of wood.
Soon.
Its not what you think.
I get horny as hell for other women.  I mean I fantasize about raping some beautiful woman.
What are you looking at?
Theres a million birds here.
Not too far.  Are you a birdwatcher too?
See anything interesting?
I would.
Doesnt everybody?
Your ivy. Too much direct sunlight. These plants dont like a lot of sun.
You dont want to know but hes damaged goods  real damaged goods if you know what I mean.
What?
I know a place in the park where only very small birds go. There are no people or dogs or ugly crows and pigeons. Its quiet except for the song of these tiny sparrowlike birds. Would you like me to take you there?
Yes.
Whats her name?
But will he... ?
Thats right you did.  Have you made any friends there?
You seem a little hostile today.
Why not?
Oh. It never crossed my mind.
Because if you did I know a therapist named Ryan. I also know a therapist named Chung.
Do you think youre crazy?
Why do you think youre here?
I mean when will I be normal.
Will I ever be normal?
I want to be normal
Walter well pick up here next time.
Youre very late.
And what are you doing?
Did you get an erection?
What?
Doesnt it get noisy?
Im not easily shocked.
Hey that was... intense.
Tell me about it.
Did I say something wrong?
Is that all?
Whats the worst thing you ever did?
Youre not joking.
What was prison like?
You really believe that?
For men like me. They say most of us end up back... there. Im saying there are risks... seeing me.
Whats this?
Whats going on?
This aint no drill slick.  Make me proud.
Nice shot Lins.
Thanks.  How you feeling big guy?
You never did like being called that did you?
You need me.  Nobody knows the systems on this rig better than I do.  What is something was to go wrong after the Explorer clears off?  What would have you done?
You wanna know what I think?
What are you still wearing that for?
I havent worn mine in months.
What happened?
Fine.  Be that way.
Come on you guys... look this is the little one right here.  You can see how its kind of zigging around.
I think it likes you.
Good hundred yards Id say.
Okay... okay.  We gotta get you out of here.
I know  I know  But we better come up with something.
Lindsey just put the thing on and shut up
Listen... will you listen to me for a second? Youre for the suit on and youre a better swimmer than me.  Right?  So I got a plan...
Oh God Lins... I
Hi tough guy.  I guess it worked huh?
Just get around so your lights are on the hatch.
Lins stay away from that guy.  I mean it.
Go to the infirmary... get the cart .. oxygen... defib kit... adrenaline in a... ten cc syringe... and some... heating blankets. You got all that?
Hes convulsing
Howdy yall.  Hey Lindsey  Ill be damned You shouldnt be down here sweet thing yall might run ya stockings.
I think theyre from you know.  Some place that has similar conditions... cold intense pressure.  No light.
Quiet  Quiet
Get comfortable.  The bad news is we got six hours in this can blowing down.  The worse news is its gonna take us three weeks to decompress back to the surface later.
I want roundtheclock manning of the sonar shack and the exterior cameras.  We need early warning if the Soviet craft try another incursion.
He cant get to the door... I think hes going to try and take him himself.
HighPressure Nervous Syndrome.  Muscle tremors usually in the hands first.  Nausea increased excitability disorientation.
What kind of light?
Used to what?
And have you any other truths to tell me?
Up until now Dad Ive been the one who hasnt wanted to marry him.
Allow me to inform you that my daughter is not a fugitive.
Its already two hours... What are we going to do?
Well?
Have you decided?
Find anything?
Yes you should go.
Good. Its better if it were absurd. That would mean nothing much can be done about it.
Really Ive got to stop this business with Ettore... I would like to go back and start working on my own projects again. You know I had many ideas...
Why are you looking at me like that?
Claudia lets get married?
Sandro wait a moment just one moment... You seem like an entirely different person ...
Sandro Im not coming down.
Im too sleepy.
But where did you finally end up?
Patrizia... Patrizia ... Wheres Ettore?
Im afraid that Anna has come back. I feel shes back and that theyre together.
You should never wish to get melodramatic over anything.
Please you come too...
Ill stay here also.
Up until now those smugglers were operating only around the Palermo area. This will be a nice surprise for the Lieutenant in Milazzo... Call up headquarters. Bring them up to date and have them give you instructions on what to do with this crate.
And who is this?
Ettore...
Nothing nothing  at all. I was just looking for Sandro.
The trouble with you is that nobody can speak to you thats all.
Giulia...
Because there is no landscape as beautiful as a woman.
Oh there are as many as one wants.
They tell me you have a lot of trouble at home. Is that right?
What other boat?
I work there but Im really a stranger.
Just a moment ago... didnt you hear the sound of a motor?
Listen Patrizia... The Marshal says theres a current that passes by here and ends up at another island... I dont know which... He wants to send one of his men over to have a look... One never knows... Do you mind if I ask Raimondo to go with him?
Weve decided to go to Montaldos place. In fact Ettore should already be there.
Raimondo... Do you enjoy fishing underwater?
Now tell the truth arent you a bit disappointed?... But I already told you...
Yes.
Because...
I... I am a little child but my body keeps getting bigger and soon I... I wont be able to fit in I... I wont be able to squeeze into Heaven.
Why?
Should you see a doctor?
Uh huh.
Often?
I dont know.
Down... there.
I fell asleep.
What baby?
No... no Im tired of talking Ive been talking for weeks nobody believes me when I tell them anything... nobody listens to me.
Would you like some?
No questions.
You liked Sister Paul?
What else did she tell you?
How did she know that?
Agnes...
Did your mother see angels often?
Do you believe she really saw them?
Why not?
How would that person get one if they didnt want one?
Agnes Im here because I want to help you.
You can tell me.
Shes dead isnt she?
What?
Agnes youre ugly... what do you say? Of course you do. Agnes youre ugly... what do you say?
Of telling you.
Why?
Oh dont be Im here. Its alright. I want you to tell me what you did before you went to bed.
Of what?
She said Michael.
So I could go to him.
No...
Ive been watching. We were fine till she came. She brought the devil here.  There was blood on her hand that night.
The longer you take to make a decision the more difficult it will be for us.
The bishop is breathing down our necks.
Here you are. Dont let anyone know where you got them.
I dont know.
Thanks. 
No
Hello Mama  ... brought you something.
Who knew about Agnes pregnancy?
Didnt she have any physical examinations in this time?
Could there have been anyone else?
From other people  I believe she is not crazy nor is she lying.
In her case it isnt. Shes had very little schooling. Her mother kept her home almost all the time and when her mother died Agnes came here to us. Shes never been out there Doctor. Shes never seen a movie or a television show. Shes never even read a book.
She didnt  This is manslaughter not murder. She didnt consciously kill that baby. Shed lost a lot of blood. She was unconscious by the time we got to her.
Who?
This convent is locked solid. The only one that has a key is Sister Marguerite and she wouldnt let Christ in after dark.
I was appalled just as you are now.
She had a... a hole in the palm of her hand  She could have bled to death.
The Catholic Church...
She is not a child.
What good would it do. No matter what you decide its either the... the prison or the nut house and the differences between them are pretty thin.
Visitors to the convent.
Do you have a... a diary or a day book?
Oh Dear God...
No it just makes you doubly responsible doesnt it?
What the hell has the Catholic Church got to do with you?
Saint Ignatius would smoke cigars and stub them out on the soles of his bare feet.  And of course 
One that will approach this matter with some objectivity and respect.
Stop laughing I dont say its the truth Im saying...
But how did it happen?
But she is not an enigma Mother. Everything that Agnes has done is explainable from modern psychiatry. One two three right down the line.
Who knew she was pregnant?
And you didnt send her to a doctor.
How fascinating. Do go on ...  ... John.
Gerron out of it youre only jealous cause youre old.
You heard it gets on my wick.
Yeah thats right they was supposed to come with us but they chickened.
Gingers mad he says things all the time and Eddys good at punching and spitting.
Sure.

He doesnt like me honest I can tell ... Its cos Im little.

Thank you.
Oh youre the understudy sort of thing?
Well the way you were spouting like ....  I dont believe you sir... and all that. Yeah it was gear.
Is it really fab or are you just saying that to convince yourself?
... all this and a jam butty too
Of course ... Look if she was a Liverpool scrubber ...  Eh fella you want to try pulling the other one its got a full set of bells hanging off it ... Ywhat? ... I know your sort two cokes and a packet of cheese and onion crisps and suddenly its love and were stopping in an empty shop doorway. Youre just after me body and ycant have it ... so there

Im adjusting the decibels on the inbalance.
Hows that?
Eh. I thought you were looking after the old man.
Shove the gentleman jockey in the makeup room or something and keep your eye on him will you?
Ill set John on you
Oh a little savage is he?
Locked.
Engines off.
Are you in pain?
Dell whats the last thing you can remember?

Hurt  How?
Well uh... good luck.  I hope you wont need me but if you do Im here.
Jay... hows it coming on the repairs?
And when will you be ready to do that?
Then why the hell are you sitting around here?
It looks completely different from the first one  its more like a worm with legs... and tentacles.
Hey are you guys still there? Whats going on?
Theres some more combustible fuel down in the storage lockers next to the lounge.  Ill go get it.
All right... but do unotu go below decks.
Where did it come from?
That thing God almighty didnt you try to get it off him?
No dont open the door.  We dont want it escaping.
Yes?
The machine will bring his temperature down.  His vital functions are strong.
While the rest of us wait down in the cooling unit with the net.
Can you get them back?
What?  What was that?
Oh no.
I think thats how its getting oxygen to him.
Whats happening up here?
This is horrible.
We cant kill it on board.  Its huge now and must have tremendous amounts of that acid in its body.
If we dont hear from him soon I think we better go in after him.
But what can we do?  Hes out of radio contact.
That sounds a little fanciful...
Theyre getting pretty close now.
Men have waited centuries to contact another form of intelligent life in the universe.  This is an opportunity which may never come again.
This is Chaz speaking.  Sorry but we are not home.  Our present location seems to be only halfway to Irth. Remain at your posts and stand by. That is all.
Atmospheric turbulence.  Dust storm.
10 argon 85 nitrogen 5 neon... and some trace elements.
Ten to the fourth dynes per square centimeter.
Still worried?
I understand why you did that.
We made it  Damn we made it
Now what?
Hey wait a minute  Thats all our food supplies in there  We cant pump poison gas all over them
This stuffs deadly  I hope we know what were doing.
Poor kitty puss puss puss.
But the lifeboat cant accelerate to light speed.
uHey watch itu
No good... its eaten too much of me...
Can I... um... have some water?  Please?
Nada. No radiation... no movement... nothing.
Looks like a spore.  Fungus of some kind maybe?
Nice howitzer youve got there.
Weve got no option.  Were gonna have to get it off.
Thats the second time I ran it and it still reads the same.
How many of them are there?
I cant reach her.  Too much signal breakup.
MarsCo went bellyup on the Dow Jones.
Wherere they headed?
When?
Picking up velocity.
Listen to what?
What?  Are you nuts?  Just the two of us?
Cant see a thing.  Are you sure?
Oh man.  Thats no glitch
Secondary fluidic shunt for the sewage system.  I found the grating ripped right off.  The little fucker was strong.
Hey Jan.  See if you can get someone to check out the chopper.
She was running a little sluggish on the way back.  Think the turbines might be playing up.
Thats what we thought.
Already working on it.
Theyve changed their heading again.
Its not all good news.  We had to take off the helmet lights.  Youll be going in blind.
Theres still time to backout.
Okay were in business.
Hey boss.  Wondered where youd gotten to.
Four.
First light well take a chopper out there and tell them to head back.
Yeah.  Somebody won.
Cornering it shouldnt be a problem.  Each part of this station is basically a selfsufficient deepspace transport module running off external couplers.  If we disconnect them and seal off every section weve got a ceiling of about thirtysix hours on internal power.  That should give us ample time to find it.
Thats the wrong way
Hurry it up.
I can... feel it moving around inside me. Youve got to kill me.
You have to...
Todays partys finished their sweep the relief teams out there now. Everybody else is either asleep or running shift in the autoshop.
Bout five minutes.
Phoebe?
Lets have a minimum of pretending. Ill want to do a column about you
I dont think thats funny.
Suites are for expense accounts. Arent you being extravagant?
I know nothing about Lloyd and his loves  I leave those to Louisa May Alcott. But I do know you.
Addison wont it be just perfect? Lloyd and I  theres no telling how far we can go... hell write great plays for me Ill make them be great  Youre the only one Ive told the only one that knows except Lloyd and me...
You sat and talked until it was light...
What have you got to do with it?
Your name is not Eve Harrington. It is Gertrude Slescynski.
A matter of opinion. Granted. It is also true that you worked in a brewery. But life in the brewery was apparently not as dull as you pictured it. As a matter of fact it got less and less dull  until you bosss wife had your boss followed by detectives
Thats not true
And you realize  you agree how completely you belong to me?
Every now and then some elder statesman of the Theater or cinema assures the public that actors and actresses are just plain folk. Ignoring the fact that their greatest attraction to the public is their complete lack of resemblance to normal human beings.
Lets go sit by the piano.
Claudia dear come closer.  This is Max Fabian. He is a producer. Go do yourself some good.
Tell me this. Do they have auditions for television?
Im giving her a very highclass party. It aint like a rehearsal she dont have to be late.
Margo? Lunching in public?
Why so remote Addison? I should think youd be at the side of your protegee lending her moral support...
Just slipped your mind.
Bill didnt say  but Lloyd was beside himself. He listened to his play as if someone else had written it he said it sounded so fresh so new so full of meaning...
Bill...
Good luck genius...
Fortyfive minutes from now my plane takes off and how do I find you? Not ready yet looking like a junk yard
Only in some ways. Youre prettier...
Oh well...  ... look through the wigs maybe it got caught
Bill...
You in a hurry?
Kid stuff or not it doesnt happen every day I want to heat it  and if you wont say it you can sing it...
Many happy returns of the day...
She did...?
Yeah... I will.
I love you too. Good night darling
Well we started talking she wanted to know all about Hollywood she seemed so interested...
So she seems.
Many of your guests have been wondering when they may be permitted to view the body. Where has it been laid out?
Addison
Its obvious youre not a woman.
Its not nonsense.
I  I dont know Bill. Just a feeling I dont know...
But you may quote me as follows. Quote. Tonight Miss Margo Channing gave a performance in your cockamamie play the like of which I have never seen before and expect rarely to see again. Unquote.
To Margo. To my bridetobe.
Its only for the license. Theres a threeday wait  blood tests things like that...
There goes Eve. Eve evil Little Miss Evil. But the evil that men do  how does it go groom? Something about the good they leave behind  I played it once in rep in Wilkes Barre...
Yes dear.
Often enough to keep the franchise.
Hello whats your name?
Every day.
Ill admit I was worried when Max called. I had my doubts.
You think?
Shes on her way. With half the men in the joint.  Its only a fur coat...
You need new girdles.
There are some human experiences Birdie that do not take place in a vaudeville house  and that even a fifthrate vaudevillian should understand and respect  I want to apologize for Birdies
You dont like Eve do you?
She works hard.
Shes loyal and efficient
You all put together?
The caterer had to back for hors doeuvres  Voila.
I aint dense. And hes been here twenty minutes.
Who are you?
You probably wont believe me.
Youre going to Hollywood  arent you?  From the trunks youre packing you must be going to stay a long time.
Thats the door.
Bill Sampson? Hes  hes a director.
You look just fine...  ... by the way. Whats your name?
... you want to be Margos new understudy.
Karen...  ... you wont forget will you? What we talked about before?
Eve. Ive heard the most wonderful things about your performance
I dont expect you to be pleasant.
In a way. You find yourself trying to say what you mean but somehow the words change  and they become his words  and suddenly youre not saying what you mean but what he means
No I dont expect you to believe anything. Except that the responsibility is mine. And the disgrace.
He can help you.
She knows enough not to be here.
Its been a real pleasure Eve.
No dont go...
Thats my job.  See you at tea time...
Miss Channing I cant tell you how glad I am that you arrived so late.
Well if youd been here to begin with I wouldnt have dared to read at all...
Would you like a drink? Its right beside you...
Margo nothing youve ever done has made me as happy as your taking Eve in...
That little place just two hours form New York. Its on my list of thingsIllneverunderstand. Like collecting shrunken Indian heads...
How far to the station?
Do you want it on?
Hes in love with you.
Why should he  and why should you?
Not to you. Not to Bill.
I dont suppose the heater runs when the motor doesnt?
With tears?
How was the concert?
Lloyd what happened...?
Thats on time for Margo.
Lloyd be careful...
But it cant be We cant be out of gas I filled it myself yesterday  Wasnt it full when you drove to Brewster this morning?
 its Addison from start to finish it drips with his brand of venom... taking advantage of a kid like that twisting her words making her say what he wanted her to say
Shes been to see me as a matter of fact she left just before you came in  you just missed her...
What with taxes coming up  and since Im a playwright and not an oil well operator  well Ive been thinking...
No I got the idea myself  while she was talking to me...
 well? What happened?
You mean  all this time  shed done nothing but apologize? Whatd you say?
Whats so funny?
I didnt think you would It seems to me Karen that for some tine now youve been developing a deep unconcern for the feeling of human being in general
Whos left out there?
Hows the new one coming?
Cora. Shes  still a girl of twenty?
Dont you think its about time it became important?
Spoken like an author.  Lloyd Im not twentyish. I am not thirtyish. Three months ago I was forty years old. Forty. Four oh.  That slipped out I hadnt quite made up my mind to admit it. Now I feel as if Id suddenly taken all my clothes off...
Shes your understudy.

Whos first?
I dont get it... this really was my turf...
Anything youve got.
And that somethings got to be more than just Hunt Liddy and the five burglarsthose indictments are gonna be bullshit when they come down. What else do we know?
We never reveal our sources which is why you can talk to us.
I hate both parties.

I  couldnt believe what she told me. Eight cups of coffee worth.

I want you to shut up and listen to me
Thats what weve got to find out but Segretti went to Southern Cal. and so did a bunch of Nixon men
You think this was Clawsens initiation?
I think thats him.
Well we are trying to ruin his life.
How many fucking sources they think we got?
You overslept?
You want Barkers phone stuff or his money stuff?
I never could figure just who this Dahlberg was.  Think it might be anything?
Sure. Him I liked he was a very nice person. Secretive too traveled all over but a decent man.
Listenwe know youre involved in thiswere going to get the story why not help?
By they you mean the White House dont you?  Your buddy from USC Dwight Chapin he works for the White House.
None of it was my idea CarlI didnt go looking for the job.
I dont know anything about Haldeman except Dwights frightened of him everybodys frightened of himChrist I wish Id never gotten messed around with thisall I wanna do is sit in the sun sit swim see some girls.
Cant help you.
Im the one sent you to Toronto Bernstein
Youre a sex junkie you know that Carl?
Its awfully hot  and you havent finished telling me about the money
Why couldnt you have just dialed me from the office Irwin?
Something maybe big.
But they both worked at the White House?
Ordinarily though what was the procedure?
Then its our asses isnt it?
Same kind of crap
I dont know I dont know it feels thin
well shit we oughtta be tense were about to accuse Mr. Haldeman who only happens to be the second most important man in America of conducting a criminal conspiracy from inside the White House  it would be nice if we were right
I got Clawsen on hold
We cant talk inside either?
Mr. Caddy? My names Bob Woodward Im from the Post and I wanted to ask about how you happened to come on this case
You thought Id help out on specifics?  Ill confirm what you get try to keep you on the right track but thats all.  Are you guys really working?  How much?
Then there must be something mustnt there. Look forget the myths the medias created about the White House the truth is these are not very bright guys and things got out of hand.
Because the press stinks toohistory on the run thats all youre interested in.  You come up with anything?
Follow the money. Always follow the money.
In my day it was simply called the double cross. I believe the CIA refers to it as Mindfuck. In our context it simply means infiltration of the Democrats.
Yes the little ratfuckers are now running our government.
What?
And Justice and FBI know all this?
Where?
Im so glad you could come Mr.
You know the paper was my fathers and my husbands when they were alive and I was thinking back a year or two ago when Ben called me and said he wanted to publish the Pentagon Papers the next day. The Times had already been stopped from publishing anymore of them and all my legal counsel said dont dont and I was frightened but I knew if I said no Id lose the whole fifth floor. So we published and that night after Id told Ben to go ahead I woke up in the darkness and I thought Oh my Lord what am I doing to this newspaper?  I woke up again last night with that same question.  Are we right on this story?
you are ignoring the importance of the Dahlberg repercussions
Mr. John Mitchell the head of CREEP says it means nothing.  ...This man and the other people involved were not operating on either our behalf or with our consent. These is no place in our campaign or in the electoral process for this type of activity and we will not forget it or condone it.
Whatd you get on W.House?
The second most powerful man is Robert Haldeman. Just below him are a trio Mr. Erlichman is Haldemans friend and they protect the President from everybody which is why they are referred to as either The German Shepherds or the Berlin Wall. Mr. Mitchell weve already discussed. Mr. Colson is the Presidents special counsel.
Whaddya got whaddya got?
You think she wants us to ease up on the story?

Maybe thats what this is all about.  Maybe she doesnt want to do this anymore.  You know adults dont do this for a living.  You guys are gonna have your kids youll be directing  one asshole in the family is enough.  Sophia knew that intuitively.  Look at Clair. Clairs a mess.  Make sure she gets the epidural.

A poor player who struts and frets his hour upon the stage and then is heard no more... And speaking of me the role of Leo in your film?
You dont have any clothes on.

Im glad thats all over for me.
What is that thing?
Lets get the kids.
Hes gonna miss his flight.
I told his father hed be on that flight.
Directing suits you.
It must be nice having so many strangers kiss your ass all of a sudden.
So?
You need to call your dad.
And you know our friends how?
Are you my big brave boy?  Are you my brave hero?
Just every once in a blue moon you know.
We closed.
I worry because you dont.  Its my job. Im feeling guilty.  I wouldve liked it if you waited until the two of you were on more solid ground.
Well be fine.
Youre out of your mind.
How much bowing and scraping do you want us to do?
Take your time Jer.
What was it?  What the fuck was it?
I love you.  Most beautiful woman in the world.
What?
Okay.  Im sorry look I meant to tell you.  It was the only chance I had to meet her.
You want me to uninvite her?
I cant imagine anyone else playing Genna.
In the kitchen.
Two minutes.
Its an unfair advantage.
I think we should all take it tonight. Everyones staying stays.  No driving. Thats the rule.  I love you SallyMae. Youre going to have a fabulous time.
Someone left the goddamn gate open.  Otis got out.  Skye and I well the... I came out of the house and the fucking gate was wide open.
Otis
Yeah lets talk about that.  You seem to be rather an expert.  I dont remember in the last five months of counselling your ever mentioning ecstacy or going to rage parties.
It is true.  You know how you love Joe? You dedicate a book to someone.
Who?  Who?  Who thinks that?
Cal too?
I told you when we met I never wanted children.  I dont want kids in my life. We talked about it.  You werent listening.
Im a monster.  Exactly.
Pretty much a disaster tonight wasnt it?
I love gifts.  What did you guys get us?
The novel.  No Skye Davidson is playing the lead.
Yes she is.
No.
Dont I find what?
Joking.
And you got Skye Davidson.  Pretty big leagues for a first timer.  Do you even like movies?
Mmm.  It says something about the two of you maybe.
A little out of my element.
Well yes.  Yes in fact.  A little on the outside yes.  And theres been all this friction.
I think a lot of this could have been avoided if Sally made more of an effort.
But youre very private people.  You know theres a kind of elitism...
The wrong word maybe.  Delete that. And you know the dog barks incessantly.
Easy tiger.
What am I five?
Lemon or raspberry?
Yes.
Ryan.
I think you should then.  You should look in on Sheila.
We have to find the dog Ryan.
Jesus Christ its a fucking dog
Im sorry.
Im so sorry.
Come on in.
The charades.
Otis  Shostakovich identified with the Jew.  He felt persecuted hunted crushed under the thumb of Stalinist imperialism.
Fuck you Panes.
I just wanted tonight to be with the people we love.
Theyre not just our business managers Panes.
I dont want it to be just one of our parties.
Like the last time.
Its our anniversary Panes.
Everyday.
So tell me hows it going?
Youre my best friend.
Were going to have to go back out there.
Thank you.  This was so unnecessary.  I hope youve noticed that Otis isnt barking as much.  We keep him in at night.
Youre keeping a record are you?
Well the neighborhood is full of dogs and its not always Otis.
Monica and Ryan.

Please Miss Kubelik you got to promise me you wont do anything foolish.
Are you all right?
Tennis racquet? Oh I remember  I was cooking myself an Italian dinner.  I used it to strain the spaghetti. FRAN  Why not?
Worse than that  she was the wife of my best friend  and I was mad for her. But I knew it was hopeless  so I decided to end it all. I went to a pawnshop and bought a fortyfive automatic and drove up to Eden Park  do you know Cincinnati?
Anyway I parked the car and loaded the gun  well you read in the papers all the time that people shoot themselves but believe me its not that easy  I mean how do you do it?  here or here or here    you know where I finally shot myself?
Uhhuh. While I was sitting there trying to make my mind up a cop stuck his head in the car because I was illegally parked  so I started to hide the gun under the seat and it went off  pow
Were going to finish that gin game.
I know.  I suppose you heard about Mr. Sheldrake ?
Good night Mr. Baxter.
What about Mr. Sheldrake?
Did you hear what I said Miss Kubelik? I absolutely adore you.
Some weather were having.  Must be from all the meshugass at Cape Canaveral.  You locked out of your apartment?
Oh Mr. Baxter  Im glad youre here  I was just going to get the passkey.
I thought I smelled gas coming from your apartment.
And Mr. Kirkeby tells me that several nights a week you work late at the office  without overtime.
The Vice Squad?

Baxter youre not reading me. I told you I have plans.
You know how people talk.
Oh yes. Thanks.
So it was.  She threw it at me.
Youre going to take her off my hands?
Yeah 
But this is the key to the executive washroom.
On account of me.
Mr. Kirkeby I dont like to complain  but you were supposed to be out of here by eight.
Mr. Sheldrake?
Let me worry about that.  Just leave the key under the mat and clear out.

You dont know what its like  standing next to you in that elevator day after day  Good morning Miss Kubelik  Good night Mr. Sheldrake  Im still crazy about you Fran.
I dont believe you.
How do you think I felt  riding home on that sevenfourteen train?
Youre not giving me a chance Fran. I asked you to meet me because  I have something to tell you. FRAN Go ahead  tell me.

Love him... Yes it is true. Thats the hard part for me... I knew him better than anyone ... I knew him best.
Ill never get over it  But Ill always remember him...

That monominute somebody gets that you need them they threaten to go away. Never fails.
Well ah... thats a personal question.
Ill never forget you said it.
I dont want to hear that music right now.
Hello.
That seems like a good choice.
Because...
If you need an excuse theres a bakery on the corner. Theres a shot itll open soon  that way were not screwy  were just two people who like warm rolls.
Hey Ive got a great compliment for you.
Do you want to know what happened with my parents?
Well...

Uhhuh...
But youre beautiful... your skin glows.
We held each other. It was better than sex. What I need he gave me great.
I love you...  Let him take you home.
What the heck are those for?
Explain to me how you can diagnose someone as obsessive compulsive disorder and then act like I have any choice in barging in.
I also regrew my beard...  but youre not interested in changes in me... so its like I always told you...  when it comes to people you...

Where you from?
What are you doing?
You cant 
Oh  I got a question.  Jesus this has been driving me crazy for years  shit listen to me.  I sound like some fucking fanboy.  Im sorry but I just got to ask you.  Everybody talks about how you left the Agency and got into the business and then how you went after the Russian Nicholai Talinkov 
So what happens now?
You understand whats going on?  It makes sense right?
Game over bitch
Im on the scent.
Such language in front of a lady.
Youre one of them arent you?  A fucking pro.
Now what?
Okay.  How did you find me?
Nikita?
He wants to kill you?
I dont need you to get the money  my money
Why?
Had?
Some people said that.  I never thought so.
Of course.  I was going to be James Bond.
It was... mechanical.  Very precise. It was exactly like the training drill except for the adrenaline.
No.  Just the first one.
Did it ever bother James Bond?
No.
Do you think about the game?
Not even a stalemate?
What will you do if this works if we get the money?
What do you think hes doing?
He cant.  The bank has an expensive security system metal detectors and Xray machines.
If things go well I dont have to. Youll already be in a rented car waiting for me.
Five million apiece.  You get on your plane I get on mine.
Ive been thinking about it for a long time.
What did he say?
You didnt take it.
Did you think they were newlyweds?
When I first saw them I thought they were married.
It was no big deal.  I saw them leave I went in.
No?
I know.  It makes me crazy.
I dont know.  When I was in college I was forced to go to a psychiatrist because I was caught drilling holes in my dorm room floor.
Because Ill take it.
Attraction is a complication?
Is this becoming complicated?
Was nice.
I prefer it like this.
Would you like a drink?
Youre very good at this arent you?
But when you finLsh a job afterwards do you think about them?
Do you think about their wives or their families?
Do you ever think about starting over?
Then Ill sail alone.
Hey do you mind if I talk a little?  I feel like I dont know talking I guess.
One hundred thousand?  Thats it? Jesus... Is that a lot?
Taken.  Thats nice.  When I had someone taken I would call our General Contractor transfer the money and as soon as I hung up the phone I forgot about them.
Everyone handles it differently. Some are ready some are not.
Some.
Can I ask you a question?
Why didnt you fade?
Yeah.
Look at that.  I havent watched the sun set in a million years. Do you mind?
You wish to close this account today?
Excellent senor.  If you could follow me?
Of course senor.
Your a good guy Chris you deserve a nice girl.
Inspirations a fickle thing you dont realise you had it till its gone.
It all comes down to ideology and theyve lost theirs. If Id been here ten years ago maybe they wouldnt be in the mess they are today.
Whos your friend?
I aint sure poetry will go down too well here.
Okay were listening. But Im with Katka on this one.
No but like my dad said Theres only so many ways you can wire a plug.
Well dont get carried away.

Moved on to plumbing huh?
Like helping a sick kid?
Afternoon
And a tram hit you?
You Romeos sure pay a high price sometimes  anyone I know?
Couldnt keep your hands off the hired help huh?
A fine specimen for conversion.
Chris can you do me a favour?
Take the drill back to Honza at the office I promised to get it back for the weekend and I dont want to show my face there.
I dont want to ruin your day.
It was all in Czech wasnt it.
What about me?
Time for lunch I think. Ill get the sandwiches. What would you like Holly?
Sure its on the red metro line you....
Its that one isnt it.
Good morning.
Well Ill try and get that clarified. As I understand it though the charges include break and enter theft trespass operating an unlicensed facility vandalism and destruction of government documents  Whatever possessed you to start destroying peoples medical records?
Well a plea of ignorance wont go far here. Frankly I think you deserve everything thats coming.
I could pencil you in if you like?
Lawrence is getting derogatory again.
So whats it going to be Coogans or U Vayvudoo?
Dont give me this Kat Im doing it for you and your country.
Doug you said you wouldnt be long. Come on Ive got to go. Now
Beer please Do you want another drink?
If you get out can we be together again.
But we could go to London and live in England.
No I am an actor not a labourer I am just warning you thats all.
Yes The Obelisk but its closed for repairs.
No thanks I must go but maybe you could get some beers for the guys.
Henry these guys already push most of the drugs in this town and now they want to move into pornography right? Believe me it wont stop there either next itll be a church and pretty soon theyll have their own department store or something...... Henry weve got to stop them. The foundations got to put an end to it
Im in close with these guys it isnt easy but slowly theyre opening up to me. Give me a month and Ill blow their movement wide open.
You mean its started?
No act of love but willing violence demanded by one and begged by the other. As life turned to fantasy and reality to ecstasy a need so deep no light could reach surfaced like a nocturnal creature unearthed for momentary and glorious display. Left alone in a rosetinted afterglow dimming fast she tasted the moisture of her body and wondered why light came to day and such desires to her paleskin body.
I thought Id help out.
Why are you doing all this what for?
A champion of lost causes huh?
Shall I wash these out?
Is it dry?
Id better get going do you need a hand to get into bed?
Better than you.
Where did you steal the car?
Why did you break into that particular building?
What was the real purpose behind this venture?
Well have to see what more we can do for you while you are still our guest.
Good try Mr. Greenwell but a little late. We have analyzed the contents of that drum the remains of the disks are there just as you said.
What is it you want?
Ill need to make a phone call.
I dont want to go.
Thats my bag.
Its more than what youre worth.
What are you an idiot
Delay Mr Greenwells departure until the disks have been located and you have notified me. Then have one of your officers drive him home  Ill see to the rest.
Shes coming over here...
Thats one girl who cant take a hint.
Thats eight years of school and training  after college. And all that doesnt necessarily make you a better human being.
Im sorry. I didnt know.
Where is he? Hes supposed to be here.
Shes like some Puritan.
I dont make small talk 
Because growing up books were my world.
You dont know me.
I hope your dreams come true.
Whats with the friggin numbers?
Looking for intelligent life?
But you think about Him  It  Her.
Like in a church painting. I see this giant hovering over the ground. Hes wearing a robe and has long flowing hair and hes pointing his finger at something.
The Bible. Why should I read a bunch of dumb stories about some ancient guy who supposedly worked miracles.
He doesnt trust you.
The plays in a couple of weeks.
Oh. Just not at school...
Or anywhere where people might see us.
So its like you want to be secret friends.
Okay. Maybe some of that is true 
Like fire.
I cant believe you asked my fathers permission.
Stand right here.
You make me feel...
Whatd you tell your father?
Whats the best thing I can see tonight?
What are you going to  ?
Nope.
Slim Jim? Apple? Yogurt? You like yogurt.
What are you thinking?
Ill talk to your father.
Did you give him a gift?
Im asking how much.
I care for her.
Its her decision and shes decided not to tell people  at least for now.
Her doctors have. Jamie and I. Were still praying for a miracle.
Landon. Weve lived with this for over a year now and 
Landon. You go on home.
You have materials for the side bearings?
You know about this stuff?
I thought she built it herself.
Now I can do what I want.
Show me some respect you little asshole. Its Special Officer Tannen to you.
Listen you little Asshole I oughta 
I dont get it. How come theres no rock n roll?
This is 1952....?
Whats N.R.C.?
Hi Marty.
Well I was on my way to school and I just wanted to stop by and see if you were feeling okay.  You seemed like you were in pretty bad shape the other night.
Hi Marty
Are you all right Marty? You seem a little...nervous.
No Chinese food is fine.
Oh no That was for the cafeteria This is different
Why what?
Yes thats my name. Who are you young man? Are you supposed to be here?
Im sorry theres no answer.
What am I radioactive or something?
Professor Brown Its almost eight thirty  Im outta here
The power of a million hydrogen bombs  ...and we get twenty four measly volts. Its not fair Ive been working on this power converter since 1949 and youd think in all that time I could find the right chemicals that would efficiently convert radiation into electric energy But no Thirty three years of dedication and research and all Ive got to show for it is a bootleg video operation
Did you ever consider that some doors are locked for a reason?
Exactly two minutes difference...  and its still ticking
He will be. Simple inebriation is all. The young man must have a rather low tolerance for alcohol... something that runs in the family. You see hes a second cousin of mine on my mothers side. Came quite a distance to visit me he added. His names Lewis.
Professor. Well not exactly Professor. You see we dont point it at the sun.
I told you not to interfere with any of the events of this time Nobodys supposed to see you here What if I was a mailman? Or a salesman?
Let me put it on a level you can understand. You dont belong here. You dont know anything about this world. You dont know the customs you dont know how to talk how to act  you dont even look like you belong here. And if you walked out on the street you wouldnt get 100 yards without being arrested. Then there would be questions and where would we come up with the answers?
An atomic bomb.
Look its not a big deal I can fix it All I gotta do is get em together and make sure my old man asks her out
In a manner of speaking yes. And because of that shes no longer interested in your father.
You didnt?
Now whos being stupid? The guy who runs this place.
Gone?... Where?
Oh yeah?
You promise to stay down there for an hour?
Catch
Whatd they look like?
Kit... Kit Ive got a question for you.
Hollys over here Kit if you want to see her.
Sure is pretty.
You know before I met her nobody could ask me how I was doing with my girl. Matter of fact I didnt really have one.
Whats going to happen to Jack and me?
Oh incidentally my last name is Carruthers. Sounds a little too much like druthers doesnt it?
Nothing.
Did it go the way it uz supposed to?
Listen maybe we ought to tell somebody about this.
Why?
Suppose the neighbors heard the noise?
Look at all this junk.
Later we found out she was deaf and we hadnt even known it.
Hey whyre you always walking ahead of me?
Yes.
Id like to get out of here.
Have you got a better idea?
This your place?
Good deal... Oh uh were on the run and wed like to hang out here for a while. Couple of hours maybe. Howd that be?
Hi whatcha doing?
Yes.
See were about out... been driving all night. Actually I dont even have time to explain it to you.

Halloween. 1938...War of the Worlds...that fake radio news broadcast that got everybody scared thinking that real live Martians were landing in Grovers Mill New Jersey  But then it all just turned out to be a hoax.
Ever since that phony phone call from the President.  Look at this. What is it?
Then what?
The professor and Dr. Emilio Lizardo were actually the first to discover the Eighth Dimension.  Almost fifty years ago.  Before Buckaroos parents even knew each other.  But there was trouble a rocket catapult failed and Dr. Lizardo got sucked half in half out...when they hauled him back he wasnt the same guy.  His hair was orange...
We will old fried we will.

So wheres Buckaroo?
Unscheduled surgery.  Hell be waltzing along momentarily.  Whatre you doing tonight?

Okay but that doesnt excuse his 
Now thats all right Barton. Everythingll be all right.
Well the basic ideas were frequently his
Barton honestly only the last couple
All right Barton Ill see if I can slip away
Ever talk to him?
...No. I never saw him with anyone else.

...I guess Im sprouting off again. But I am certain of this Garland Im capable of more good work. Maybe better work than I did in Choirs. It just doesnt seem to me that Los Angeles is the place to lead the life of mind.
...Look they love you kid  everybody does. You see Cavens review in the Herald?
Barton? What time is it? Are you all right?
...Thats fine.
And whats your line Mr. Meadows?
Hell yes. Because I believe in it. Fire theft and casualty are not things that only happen to other people  thats what I tell em. Writing doesnt work out you might want to look into it. Providing for basic human need  a fella could do worse.
What kind of scribbler are you  newspaperman did you say?
Thats okay Charlie. Im a playwright. My showsve only played New York. Last one got a hell of a writeup in the Herald. I guess thats why they wanted me here.
Caught me trying to be fancy Yeah thats it Bart.
...I dont guess this means much to you.
And thats the point that we all have stories. The hopes and dreams of the common man are as noble as those of any king. Its the stuff of life  why shouldnt it be the stuff of theater?  Goddamnit why should that be a hard pill to swallow? Dont call it new theater Charlie call it real theater. Call it our theater.
...It was taken by one of my policy holders. Theyre more than just customers to me Barton.  They really appreciate what I have to offer them. Ya see her hubby was out of town at the time 
...This must be boring you.
...All right now when I say Ready... wrestle  you try and pin me and I try and pin you. Thats the whole game. Got it?
Its okay its okay.
I hope these are your shoes.
Because that would mean they gave you mine.
...Listen to me bellyachin. As if my problems amounted to a hill of beans. How goes the life of the mind?
And theres hope for you too Charlie. Tomorrow I bet you sell a halfdozen policies.
Why dont we go to your room
Hold on 
Hold on. Stop. Take a deep breath. Tell me what happened.
Jesus... They can tell that...
Yeah but Charlie 
...Where did we put him?
...Well Bart which is it? Orphan? Dame?
Mr. Lipnik I really would feel much better if you could reconsider 
Sex? Hes a MAN We WRESTLED
Yeah and Im Buck Rogers.
Also known as Madman Mundt.
Started in Kansas City. Couple of housewives.
Doctor. Ear nose and throat man.
Good luck with no fuckin head.
Hollywood precinct finds another stiff yesterday. Not too far from here. This ones better looking than the doc.
Sixth floor too high for you Fink?
He teach you to do it?
...Maybe we should do a treatment.
Get down on your knees you sonofabitch  Get down on your knees and kiss this mans feet
Okay.  I went after him.  I lost my temper.
Where were you tonight?
All night?
Yeah I was drinking.
Theres no smoking in this building.
How is your  personal life?
You okay?
Catherine Tramell.
We were in some of the same classes.
Who?
She must really be something.  From a clinical point of view.
What do you want Nick?
Shes really sick you know.  Dont you know what shes doing?  She knows I went to Berkeley.  She knows I knew Noah.  She makes up that story about me.  Shes handing you somebody whos obsessed with he her.
Put your fucking hands up  Dont move.
How long were you having sex with him?
Did you leave the club with him?
Ms. Tramell wed like you to come downtown and answer some questions for us.
Do you always keep old newspapers around?
I told you  I quit.
Writing a book about it gives you an alibi for not killing him.
How did you feel when I told you Johnny Boz had died  that day at the beach.
But you didnt hurt 
Even though you were fucking him.
If I were guilty and if I wanted to beat that machine it wouldnt be tiring.  It wouldnt be tiring at all.
I dont know anything that isnt police business.
It was an accident.  They got in the line of fire.
Tell me about Professor Goldstein.
I didnt.
How exactly did you hear?
Youre not easy to figure.  Im just very good at figuring.
What if I asked you not to call me Shooter?
My wife used to call me that.
Why take the risk?
Did you think it was so special?
You shouldnt play this game.
Do you think I told her to kill You?
Do you think she killed Johnny Boz?
I thought you didnt do adolescent secrets.
You wont believe me.
I just thought Id surprise you.  Whats the matter?
I have to do some research tomorrow.
No thanks.
A detective.  He falls for the wrong girl.
They fuck like minks raise rugrats and live happily ever after.
What do we do now Nick?
There is no smoking in this building Ms. Tramell.
Did you ever engage in sado masochistic activity with him?
Did you kill Mr. Boz Ms. Tramell?
How did he die?
No suspects no motive.  Unsolved.
Yeah he said it was routine too. Now its two guys saying its routine.
What kind of talk?
He had a girlfriend?
Aint that cute?  They got his and her Pigassos son.
Howd it go son?
Aint you go nothin better to do than to come in here and jack off the damn machine?
Do you remember a case  1956  Hazel Dobkins?
You think I 
I dont give a... flyin... chili bean... fart about AIDS
You all right pop?  You want me to drive you?
So Nilsen had a report on her  so what.  You dont know what the hell was in it?
Not unless she got up in the ring and turned into one mean sonofabitch.
You look like dogshit.
Youre already gettin psychological input son.
I love it.  Shes got a hundred million bucks.  She fucks fighters and rock and roll stars.  And shes got a degree in screwing with peoples heads.
So what do we do  nothing?
What is all this Nick stuff  Nick would you like a cigarette. Nick can you give me a ride.
Now what?
Come on Phil.  Youre not gonna let this slide.  What about her parents?  What about what else shes published?  At least we should get the stuff to see if we find anything else thats an amazing reallife coincidence.
Beth?  Now youve got Beth killing people?
Tell me again.  I want to hear you say it again.
Youre driving around North Beach for no particular reason and this car wont get out of the way 
Shes a suspect.
Shes got enough money to burn this whole department down.
Were sorry to disturb you wed like to ask you some 
Who are you?
My name is Jean Michel Basquiat. Have you heard of me?
Whens your show?
This is painted on a backdrop from the Kabuki theater in Japan. I painted it after Joseph Beuys died. A rebirth painting. I felt like he couldve painted it or maybe someone else was painting it instead of me. The Chinese calligraphers used to change their name midcareer so they could start over as someone else..
Youre asking me this because of the lapdog remark. I read that. The person that wrote that has the compassion of a housefly. Thats your enemy not your audience. Your audience hasnt even been born yet. Its a lie that art is popular. The only thing popular about it is that its written about in newspapers. Im surprised when anybody comes to my openings. Therere about ten people on the planet who know anything about painting and Andys one of them.
Its in New York.
Andy man thanks for coming. Id like to paint your jacket.
Jean Michel this is Mary Boone. Shes got the great new gallery.
Yeah  Id do that... You could teach me.
How come youre not peeing on them yourself?
Naaaa. Poor thing has a little dick.
You shouldnt have put it in the show. This is the one I absolutely have to have. I really love it.
Jean Michel... Crawling from the wreckage?
Yes I understand  but where do you take them from?
I see..  And... How do you respond to being called  hmmm...   yes the pickaninny of the art world.
Would you like to see the wine list?
Im sorry Mr. Basquiat.
Yeah just put their bill on my tab.
You want me to put it here?
Its Maria Portos. What should we do?
I knew I left these somewhere. One of thesell send your kids to college someday.  Here  I made this for you.
You got a date already?
Oh man Folklore guy  worked on the railroad. Yknow pounding in spikes and laying down track. Then one day they invented a machine to do it. And he says Fuck that Im a MAN and he challenges the machine to a race to lay down a mile of track. It takes two days. Neck and neck the whole time. They get right to the end and he beats it by one spike.  Got a cigarette?
Shes good.
Basquiat those are my best clothes What are you doing?
Youre back.
Which island of Hawaii do you want our house to be on? Maui? Kaui? Molokai?
... babies.
Whats wrong with me?
Hi.
Whats that?
So are you really friends with Andy? He seems like such a weirdo.
Wow. Congratulations. I hate that asshole.  Thanks for coming. I guess I just wanted to find out how youre 
Baby I think about you a lot. Im really sorry about everything. You have to believe me. Im serious. I wish yknow that we were 
I really... admire you.
Ive seen you before. I like your paintings a lot. Your hair was different.
See you later.
No Id like the scarf.
Uh huhh... Band practice?  Its Benny. He wants to know why youre not at band practice...?
Fuck band practice... If youre gonna be a painter youre gonna have to break a few hearts  you dont wanna be like Tony Bennett..
That ones for you.
You dont have any
You nuts? Let him order? You on his side? Youre not such a good waitress. You get out too.
YO Jean this is Ramellzee.
Selina ... more facets than Vicki huh?  Funny but sort of mysterious...
Ah.  Who may I ask are you going as?
Admiring your handiwork?
Well thats a ... long story ...
I dont see how ... Anyway its a treat to find you out in the world away from Ebeneezer Shreck.
Youre not coming to that are you?  The Relighting of the Tree thing?
... and me.  No thats be me and me.  Is that what I said?
Im sure hes wonderful company and all but ... doesnt the gold plated bachelor bit get a little ... stale?
Well?  Was Vicki right?  About your difficulty with duality?
Theres a big comfy California King over in Bedding.  What say we ...
A kiss under the mistletoe. Mistletoe can be deadly if you eat it ...
... What do we do?
No.  No glass on the inside.
If my life has had any meaning thats the meaning.
Lets make a deal.  uOtheru than my blood what can I off
Selina  Selina Kyle?  Youre fired  And Bruce  Bruce Wayne Why are you dressed up as Batman?
Appetite for destruction? Contempt for the czars of fashion? Wait dont tell me ... Naked sexual charisma?
Thanks.  Jeez.  Not used to this manwoman catmouse business. Generally the babes flock to me I tell em take a number.
Me domesticated?  By you?  I doubt it  You repulsive... awful... upenguinu.
You buy this blurry business?
Most of all I want to find out who I am.  By finding my parents. Learning my human name.  Simple stuff that the good people of Gotham take for granted.
Dont look Oswald.  Its a surprise.
I dont.  So no.
Big giant ucapacitoru.  And that instead of generating power itll sort of be    usuckingu power from Gotham City and storing it ... stockpiling it sort of?  Which unless Im being dense is a novel approach Id say.
How long has it been Uncle Alfred?
You certainly will not.
I guess they dont have fax machines on elephants.
Its good to see you again Uncle. Ive missed you.
I came to give you your freedom a chance to live the life you choose. The same gift you gave me.
Hes overeager impulsive.  I cant trust him not to get hurt.
You have?
Well I hope youll stay with us.
I am as well as can be expected.
I love you old man.
Its good to see you.
This is to replace the bike I lost. Ill get you the rest.
Servants Masters its  ridiculous. Alfred is the sweetest most noble man alive and hes subjugated all his life and dreams to someone else.
Paying someone to prepare your meals and do your laundry and clean your dishes you call that family?
Nice suit.  And today you are?
Shes definitely part of this.  Its weird for a while Ivy was all I could think about.  But then...
Ummhmmmm.
Why is she so desperate to kiss us? Im betting her lips are poison.
We gotta get those locks changed.
Winded old timer?
What can I do for you Doctor?  A research grant?  A hospital wing?
We cut our support.  A conflict of ideologies.  Dr. Woodrue was a lunatic.
And?
Youre not even listening to me.
Julie Im not the marrying kind. There are things about me you wouldnt understand.
Whos Ivy?
What happened to his wife?
Absolutely.  Just as soon as you take ten hours training in the simulator.
Of course.  Alfred still keeps your mothers picture in his room.
Like hell you do.
Hail the allknowing Bruce Wayne. Heres what I know she loves me Not you and its driving you crazy. Its why you stopped us from kissing. Because if you cant have her nobody can.
One question.  When Batgirl and I rolled off the telescope how come you didnt try and save us? It was the first time I fell and you werent there to catch me.
Let me guess Plant Girl? Vine Lady? Ms. Moss?
I have created a race of plants with the strength of the deadliest animals.  Once you have frozen mankind my mutants will overrun the globe.  The Earth will become a brave new world of only plants. And we shall rule them.  For we will be the only two people left in the world.
What say we turn up the heat?
How about dangerous curves?
You should have heeded your pointy eared pal.  These lips can be murder.
...Would it be a terrible imposition to ask you to take better care of your equipment?
Its happening again. Just like my parents. A monster comes out of the night. A scream. Two gunshots. I killed them.
Letters in the alphabet.
What now sir?
Up here Al.
...dual personalities. Abnormal psychology. Washingtons poster child for the criminally insane. I read your work.
I wish I could say my interest in you was purely professional...
A girl cannot live by psychoses alone.
Welcome to my parlor said the Riddler to the Bat. Hows tricks?
Death.  Death. Without taste sound and all around us.  Because there is no way for me to save them or myself. This is one giant death trap.
Mr...?
Um...Im pretty sure Im Bruce Wayne. And you are?
Call my secretary shell set something up.  Factory looks great folks.  Keep up the good work.
How can I help you Mr. Wayne?
Patient apparently suffers from acute obsessional syndrome with potential homicidal styles. Work better for you?
That kid is amazing.
Me? Im easy. Especially after a couple of martinis.
Why do you do that?
And the beast slouches towards Bethelem.
Theres something I want to talk with you about. Its...Well we.. I...
We dont kill. Killing is what damns you. It. What am I talking about? This conversation is over. Youre going away to school.
You cant.
But what about all the good we can do? There are monsters out there. Gotham needs us.
Who is The Batman Edward?
Yo. Charlie. Gimmie an order of brain deepfry. Extra well done. Hold the neurons.  Patient exhibits symptoms of psycho neural overload. Notation obviously higher settings can be dangerous to the subject.  Riddle me this Fred. What is everything to someone and nothing to everyone else? Your mind of course. And now mine pumps with the power of yours.  New from Brainbok. Da pump. Think faster. Reason higher. Outcognate every homey on the court of life. Da pump. Yeah.  Ho Mark. I sense an odd penchant for the anagramatic. The acrostic. The cryptographic. What doth this bode? Answer me Marcutio you little runt.  Fred I must confess you were a wonderful appetizer. Simply divine. But now I yearn for a meal of substance. The main course. A wide and varied palette. Ah to taste the mind of a hero. A nobleman. A poet.  A chick in a short skirt wouldnt be so bad either.
...or death.
Howd you find us?
Harvey. You need me. Since youve gotten out of Arkham youve managed what? To bungle stealing a safe? Wreck a statue? And correct me if Im wrong here but werent you outsmarted by an acned acrobat at the circus?
Holy shit.
Where are you sending Batboy this time?
How high up would you say that is?
I know the feeling. It wont last.  Hes a long way ahead of where I was at his age.
How longs it been Alfred? A quarter of a century?  It seems like yesterday. I guess we ended up doing more harm than good.
GET IN THE CAR
Look Police
What about the girl?
How much do you weigh?
Thank you Vicki.
Howd you find this place?
I just cant absorb it all. This place the equipment. What it must have cost.  Why all the secrecy? Why do you wear the mask?
Thats how it is chum. One column  and I can bring all this tumbling down. I can take you off the streets for good.
No.
Im sorry Bruce I Just cant seem to get a handle on this conversation.
God.  You would.  Come on Bruce.  I just want to get two drinks in you.  As an experiment.
Whos this Bruce? Are you trying to make me jealous?
So we just pretend none of this ever happened. We never met. We    Youre going to get yourself killed Bruce. You know that dont you?
Got it all figured huh?  Grissom just sits back and hands you the reins.   Maybe he dont know what we know.
I dunno man.  After what happened to Johnny Gobs  
My brothers a priest man.
Why do you need me to handle a simple breakin?
God Vick a girl could get hurt doing this.
Small so far.  I think hes leaving the big fish for Harvey Dent.
No.
Man I feel like Robin Leach.  You actually know all these people?
Allie I know exactly why youre doing this.
Hes best friends with Jim Gordon and Harvey Dent.  They would know.
Vicki. We got a wealthy millionaire here... who dresses up like a bat. He goes out at night and swings around  in his cape  on a rope.  CRAZY BATSTARD
Jennifer can stay and look after Kevin
And what did you say?
Im not sure I got the right person but they were a bit busy ...
I know you are.  Very serious ... most of the time these days.
Here let me do that.
Goodnight Annie.
David.  Theres a call for you.  Its your wife.
Better go.  Grierson hates people being late.
Seems to be a problem with the door. Wheres the picture gone?
Oh yes.
It wasnt a dream was it.  I have to go in to work and tell them Whistlers Mother now looks like Danny De Vito.
Its very good Bernie.
And howls Alison?
Saw her at the movies the other night with that boss of hers.  Nice guy.  Good looking.
Lord Walton assures me this guys one of the very top scholars in the English art world.  Has a couple of doctorates no less.
So why not haul your ...  nice little ass into this room and explain to me and my wife why our precious daughter is going to be absolutely fine because of all the fantastic intelligence and attention you are going to give her case.
Oh look I mean its kind of the last thing... I mean Id really like to but... things at home are kind of sensitive so I couldnt really er ...
The thing is sir Ive just been giving the painting a very thorough inspection with the help of Dr Bean here  and we feel the times come for Whistlers Mum to have her first facelift.
Well congratulations.  Isnt that great David?
All the guys they claim are English to and goodlooking like Dan Day Lewis and Liam Neeson turn out to be Irish.  Even Anthony Hopkins is welsh.  Prince Charles is so ugly they pay him two million bucks a year to stay indoors.
As you can see securitys pretty tight in this section.  Nobody gets past Elmer here.  Isnt that right?
He was incredible.  This guy is fearless.  He has no fear.
Well there is that ...
We need you urgently in C Theatre.
off the peg?
I wish I could use that at school.  Hey Teach no hard feelings ... Its just things between us aint what they used to be and I need a little space ya know?  So I11 see you around in a couple of years maybe.

We got nothing Chief. We tore the place apart. We can only legally hold her for another couple of hours.
Did you give him a full cavity search?
We just cleared all four floors. No sign of him.
OK nobody shoot. He could still have the unit on him. Keep your distance. We dont wanna take a chance on hitting it.
Whoa this kicks ass Huh huh huh.
Uh hey. One of you kids got a match?
You scored with two chicks?
There are a thousand things... Why did you disappear when you walked off the front porch?  Is this a punishment?  Are we halfway to heaven or are we halfway to hell? And how long is this going to ulastu?
Oh Adam dont ever leave me alone.
Thats it?  No number or instructions?
Theres nothing we can do.  Its just a matter of time before they unlock this room.  There goes my model.  There goes our last refuge.
My God were back where we started.
Lydias trying but they dont believe her.
Did you copy these gravestones right Adam?
But uweu let him out.
Ah Adam you dont know anything about little girls.  Shes just... missed out on some love thats all...
uYouu did this?  You carved all these little figures and houses and things?
You tell them that we are desperate horrible ghoulish creatures who will stop at nothing to get back our house.
Nine months?  What difference does that make?
I heard.  Tore your face right off  Bad news.  It obviously doesnt do any good to pull your heads off in front of people if they cant see you.
Just get some people out of our house.
Just one daughter.
I dont like Charles Deetz particularly but you could have ukilledu him.
The whorehouse was my idea. I want Betelgeuse out of the picture  Weve got some serious talking to do.
He said if I let him out he would take me over to the other side to find you.
You could double the size of your hardware store  Youll be rich.
Oh honey... I didnt mean anything ... its just too big for you two. I know these things.
Mr. and Mrs. Maitland?  Ive come for the last time.  Where are you?  Barb...
Well yes of course.  Its great over here.  Youll meet all the greats.  James Dean.  Buddy Holly.  The little things a you say and do... make me want to be with youahoo.
I cant help you from this side but heres how we do it.  So usimpleu.  Say my name three times. Thats all.  Ill be all yours. Then Ill bring you over here in style.
Your name is uBeetle Juiceu?  Yecch Thats as bad as uDeeeulia uDeeeutz.
No I dont.  I dont take orders from smurfs.
Theyd look silly on me.  Im fourteen years old
Its uOthou
Otho knows as much about the supernatural as he knows about interior decoration.
Lydia relax.  Well build you a darkroom in the basement.
Yeah maybe if hes nice hell let me hang myself from a rope in his barn.
Skeleton keys never work.  Anyway this can wait.  Well get a crowbar later.  Your mother...
Well this is... I mean this is the weirdest 
Look at all that uparkingu
Now lets get back to business. I want to get Maxie Dean and Sarah up here immediately.  I can make history here  Im going to turn this sleepy little backward town into a leading supernatural research center... and amusement park.
Ill bring the wine... and the business plan.  And Lydia youll bring the ghosts.
Theyre... not here anymore.
Are they suffering?
I plan to have a stroke from the amount of MSG thats in this food.
Dont you udareu.
What do you think?
uOh my Godu
I will tell you what is boring.  Once you cover up the wallpaper knock down a few walls alter the traffic patterns and  perhaps  only perhaps  think about an inground pool  the place umightu just be livable.  Whats on the third floor?
I have a feeling theres some very interesting space behind this door.
Is this the key to the attic?
Are we going to be seeing you at Miss Shannons Boarding School?
Its bad luck.  And I believe hugely in luck.
Otho thats terrible.
Wait a minute  What am I worried about?  Otho you cant even change a tire
Their wedding clothes.
You can pull your trousers up now.
An attorney?
Oh I see...  ... Well then... Youre a very funny man Mr. Gardiner. You caught me off guard I must admit...
Good keep your weight off that leg Mr. Gardiner. In fact it would be best if you could stay here for a day or two if that would be would be possible. Since Benjamin became ill we have our own hospital downstairs. I can promise you the finest in care unless of course you would prefer to go elsewhere.
... And please call me Robert.
... Benjamin has been hounding me to allow him to address the annual meeting of his Financial Institute today but obviously the strain would be impossible... How about here Chauncey any soreness?
... Oh.  ... My God I only wish that Benjamin had your recuperative powers... Anyway the President offered to sit in for Ben at the meeting quite a nice gesture I felt. Hes due here soon I believe.
Why thats terrific Chauncey.
Eve is going to stay. The house will not be closed.
Yes. I love Eve very much.
I know exactly what you mean. Today the businessman is at the mercy of kidlawyers from the SEC. All they want to do is regulate our natural growth Its happening across the country
Some pain is to be expected...  ... And I think what would be best for the two of you is a good nights rest.  ... Its late Im afraid its time for my patients to prepare for bed.
Good God Eve  youll freeze out here.
Not necessary but preferable. I dont think hell be a bother he seems like a most refreshing sort of man.
How true. Mr. Gardiner may be a welcome change of pace.
... Do you think we should look for him?
Another thing that baffles me Doctor  what was his connection with the deceased? Major financial dealings obviously  but our firm has no record of any such transactions.
Gentlemen I didnt call you here at such an hour to make accusations I just want to explore the possibilities. Now I have three questions Is the man a foreign agent? Or have we suddenly found that our methods of gathering data are grossly inefficient? Or thirdly have the mans files been destroyed? Now Id like some answers.
I dont think thats entirely true Grover.
Well Mr. President... They dont quite know what to think.
A Black man gave me the message.
Mr. Gardiner I have a telephone call for you. Sidney Courtney the financial editor of the Washington Post.
Of course. They would like you to appear on the show tonight. The Vice President was scheduled but he had to cancel and they asked if you would be interested.
... Wont you let us do something for you? Your leg should be examined we could take you to a hospital.
Yes. My husband has been very ill. His doctor and nurses are staying with us. Those hospitals can be so impersonal  why it might be hours before you are treated...
... Ill feel so relieved after Dr. Allenby examines your leg. After that David can run you on home or to your office or wherever youd prefer...  ... Is there anything special you would like to watch?
I can see that it must be very important for you to stay informed of all the latest events.
... Would you like us to notify anyone for you?
Was he a relative? Or an intimate friend?
Oh I see... Your mentor perhaps?
Chauncey...
Hes tired Chauncey  but hes going to watch you tonight. Well both be watching.
Oh. Well we can fix up one of Bens for you tomorrow night. Sophie insists an Black Tie.
I know you are Chauncey...  ... You conquer a woman from within herself you infuse in her the need and desire and the longing for your love.
... Come in Chauncey  please come in...
Im sorry to disturb you Mr. Gardiner I know you must be very busy.
... Are you sure you like it?
Im sorry we havent met sooner Mr. Gardiner. I had the pleasure of seeing you on television last night and I listened with great interest to your downtoearth philosophy. Im not surprised that it was so quickly endorsed by the President.  ... Tell me Mr. Gardiner just how serious is Benjamins illness? I did not want to upset Mrs. Rand by discussing it in detail.
And I have noticed in you a certain reticence regarding political issues  so why not a coming together? An interchange of opinion? We may find my friend that we are not so far from each other not so far
Yes. Tell me Mr. Gardiner  do you by any chance enjoy Krylovs fables? I ask this because there is something... there is something Krylovian about you.
I feel very good in here.
Yes. Shut down and locked by the attorneys.
Thats good Mr. Gardiner. Or may I call you Chauncey?
Do we have a garden? Hah Tomorrow Chauncey you will see our gardens.
Bravo
Well thats good news my boy.
Hah Its all makeup Chauncey... I asked nurse Teresa to fix me up I didnt want the President to think I was going to die during our talk.
I think what my most insightful friend is saying Mr. President is that we welcome the inevitable seasons of nature yet we are upset by the seasons of our economy.
Oh sure you do the financial assistance program. I think you might be just the man to take charge of such an undertaking. Id like you to meet with the members of the Board well be able to discuss the matter at greater length at that time.
Let me feel the strength in your hand Chauncey... Let me feel your strength...  Yes thats good... I hope Chauncey  I hope that youll stay with Eve... Take care of her watch over her shes a delicate flower Chauncey...
Tell Eve? You mean Mrs. Rand?
... Did you wish to see someone sir?
How about taxes Mr. Chance surely you must have paid taxes?
Might you have a birth certificate Mr. Chance?
I am allowed to go to the attic and select any of the Old Mans suits. They all fit me very well. I can also take his shirts shoes and coats.
This is terrible sir   I hope youre not badly injured...
I dont think we should call anyone just yet it may not even be all that serious.
How long do we stay in here?
... Evening Chance.
... I see.
Im sorry to say that our time is running short but before we close Id like to ask one final question. What sort of gardener sir would you be?
Hello Thomas... Im Chance the gardener.
... Were with Franklin Jennings and Roberts the law firm handling the estate.
Your lunch? You have a luncheon appointment here?
... Youve quite a sense of humor Mr. Chance  but all kidding aside may I ask just what you are doing here?
Mr. Chance perhaps you could show us some identification with your address  a Drivers License a credit card checkbook?
Mr. Chance that was twentyseven years ago.
... We shall need some proof of your having resided here Mr. Chance.
Correct.
... Sid be reasonable  Ive been everywhere theres no place left to check
You heard?
... Ben really...
I shall take the gentleman to the third floor guest suite maam. Dr. Allenby is standing by.
Come on Eve. Lets let the men talk there are so many people that have been asking about you.
... Is it me? Is there something Ive done?
... Would you take me on a tour?
... Yeah...
No Hes a real gardener
... Business bullshit Going out in the middle of the night to meet that bitch in a bar...
What do you mean there is nothing? Thats impossible.
Hmmm... Take this down.  I want this quote included in the Tass coverage Chauncey Gardiner in an intimate discussion with Ambassador Skrapinov noted that Unless the leaders of the opposing political systems move the chairs on which they sit closer to each other all of their seats will be pulled from under them by rapid social and political changes.
Kaufman Im going to need information on Mr. Chauncey Gardiners background.
And put it through on a Code Red  I want it as soon as possible.
I do not want Benjamin Rand disturbed You have other ways of gathering information than to trouble a dying man. Use whatever agencies are necessary to put together a detailed history of Chauncey Gardiner if you run into problems alert Honeycutt.  Ill be in the office at seven in the morning and I would like to have it at that time.  Ive got to take a leak.
This information goes back three days. I want the standard file you know that.
... So what does all that add up to?
You have proven that already Comrade Skrapinov you are to be congratulated for recognizing the importance of this man and establishing an early friendship.
Mr. President Id like you to meet my dear friend Mr. Chauncey Gardiner.
... Well?
Well Ben... I...
Hello Im here about the ad.
When you say I can be somebody else what do you mean exactly?
Weve been over this. Nobodys looking for a puppeteer in todays wintry economic climate.
Isnt that cute? I just taught her that.
Sevenish
Theyll understand. Besides Ive got a morning appointment tomorrow with Elijahs shrink. Were getting to the bottom of this acid stomach.
So how was it? What was he doing?
Nothing. Dont go Craig. Ive been thinking. Lets try to work this out. Weve got so much history.
Im getting rid of the fucking animals.
Im sorry. That was nasty.
Sometimes were forced to make hard decisions.  Id like for us to stay together Craig. You know platonically if thats possible. I truly value our friendship.
Im your Goddamn wife. Once you vowed to cherish me forever. Now you hold a gun to my head?
You didnt do anything about it out of respect for the fact that she wouldnt let you near her with a ten foot pole which is by the way about nine feet nine inches off the mark anyway.
My God
I dont know. Theres a small community of us. We have a place they dont know about. Were happy. Well keep trying to figure out a way. Come stay with us. Join the struggle.
Holy shit He said what I said
Really? For most people its a rather pleasant experience. What exactly did you...
Welcome to LesterCorp. May we meet your filing needs?
Pardon?
Youre not like the other boys weve had here. Granted I cant understand what youre saying either but your soft palette resonates tremendously well and you never ever constrict your epiglottis.
No. I understand perfectly.
Just one. Why is this floor so short?
Youre making a big mistake Schwartz.  Maam
There are rules boy procedures etiquette. This is not a toy. Ive been waiting seventy years to utilize this room grooming myself quietly setting the stage performing ablutions paying tribute seeing all his motion pictures again and again. Worshipping Schwartz worshipping properly.
Moving story.
Listen. Im Craig Schwartz just starting out at LesterCorp.
Why not?
Who told you?
I like you. I dont know what it is exactly.
Thats the usual?
Hi.
Its just and Ive never done this before Maxine but its just that I feel something for you. Ive never felt this before for anyone not even my wife. My future is with you Maxine.
Lots of things. Hes very well respected. That jewel thief movie for example. The point is that this is a very odd thing supernatural for lack of a better word. It raises all sorts of philosophical questions about the nature of self about the existence of the soul. Am I me? Is Malkovich Malkovich? Was the Buddha right is duality an illusion? Do you see what a can of worms this portal is? I dont think I can go on living my life as I have lived it. Theres only one thing to do. Lets get married right away.
Really?  But Maxine can of worms End of the world Illusory nature of existence
This is amazing Were gonna be rich
Youre late.
Ive fallen in love.
Lotte this is so good...
Lotte? Is that you?
So thats the story of 7 12. Since the rents are considerably lower this floor has been adopted by businesses which for one reason or another are forced to cut corners After all... the overhead is low Ha ha ha
No. Dont be an ass.
Vegas? Whatd you think?
What kind of circumstances?
Do tell. I love a good plan.
I missed you. Im sorry. Tell me the plan.
I was just asking. No disrespect intended.
Fine. I mean its not like I was doubting you its just that I know puppetry is a skill that takes a long time to acquire.
Do you dream often?
I dont know anything about her. What if shes some sort of witch or something?
You dont look a day over one hundred and five Captain. Whats your secret?
But now weve lost access to Craig.
You know I think it pays to leave juicemaking to the trained professionals. You look terrible my dear.
Hmmm a lesbian are you? I must inform you that I find that highly arousing.
Thank you all for your efforts but Im afraid we can no longer get into Malkovich through the portal.
And the funny thing is. Mr. Malkovich my voice is probably the least intriguing thing about me.
Oh my darling. Oh my sweetheart.
Maxine Listen  It hasnt been me in John the last three times. Craigs had me locked up in the apartment. He made me call you at gunpoint. Its been him Oh God its been him
But Maxine I thought it was me you loved.

Seems like hes doing me a favor then.
how long since he was bitten?
No hemoglobin left. Their metabolisms are too fast.  They burn out.  Thats why theyre having to feed so often.  Their systems are self destructing.
Ive never seen anything like this.  The Reapers are as different from us as we are from you.  Its almost as if the virus is rewiring their bodies creating new parasitic organs which consume the old ones.
Because one of us is going to kill the other before this ends.
Get real.  I was useful to Damaskinos as long as the hunt was still on.  Now that its over all bets are off.
What do you want me to do?
You came back for me.

Come on Blade.  Talk to me
And so will we.
The genetic material you spliced into Nomak   Where did you get it?
You got something in mind Blade?
Nomak?
I would hate to think you were losing your perspective.  Who do you think God favors in the web?  The spider or the fly?
Any casualties?
You worry too much Stevens.  I have assurance from our friend inside that events are unfolding as scripted.
Gave it a more aggressive exhaust profile ramping.
Youre wasting your time already been tried.
I had to increase the dose. Youre building up a resistance to the serum 
Get in. Youre leaving.
Why not? The future of our race runs through your bloodstream. Youve got the best of both worlds Blade. All of our strengths and none of our weaknesses.
No longer.
You shouldnt be here.
I cant just leave. I have a life here a career 
But he couldve 
But hes a policeman 
Thats a glyph kind of like a vampire cattle brand. That means Officer Friendly here is someones property. Any of the other vampires try to bleed him theyll have to answer to Friendlys owner   This glyph belongs to Deacon Frost. Weve been tracking him for a while now 
Look if what you say is true if theres a chance I could turn into one of them then Ive got no choice do I? I have to work with you. I need to learn everything I can about them. Its the only way Ill be able to find a cure for myself.
What are you looking at?
I cant close my eyes without hearing her scream.
I do. I remember from day one. People staring at me sensing I was different. Watching the fear grow in their eyes knowing in their hearts I wasnt human.
My mother used to say that a cold heart is a dead heart.
Get out of here 
Hows it going Kam?
This isnt human blood.
I thought you promised to give me some distance?
Five minutes not a second more. And I dont want to hear a word about us.
I see. And what would you have us do with this halfbreed?
These archives are restricted to members of the House of Erebus.
Youre wasting your time Frost. Far greater scholars than you have tried to decipher these words. Whatever secrets they hold have been lost.
Youre a monster.
What  ?
So what do you use then? A stake?
Blades unique you know. A one in a billion anomaly. He can withstand sunlight garlic even silver. But he still has the Thirst.

Greetings Mr. George.
On the plane.
Pleased to meet you finally George.  I am Augusto Oliveras.
Yes.  Jack Stevens is already a very busy man.  Along with many others.  You shouldnt stay away so long.
Im so glad you two could make it. Mirtha look at you.  So beautiful.  You look like youre about to burst.
Nothing like this back home.
This is it for me.
Are you sure this guy is cool?
Should we buy it?
Promise me that well never be like them.  I dont want to wind up like that.
George I went to the doctor.  I dont have two years.
Excuse me?
Not so fast.  I would like to go over the details.
Hmm.  I see.  Will there be clothes in the suitcase?
Whose cloths?  Your clothes?
I demand to know everything.  I do not trust sixhundred thousand dollars of coca to someone I dont know.
Mirtha.
What the fuck is that?
The way we figure it Barbara flies to Boston twice a week.  Two bags per flight.  Twentyfive pounds in each bag.
Come on George no one is going to pay that.
I dont think so.
Half a million for you.  Half a million for me.  Onepointthree five for the Colombians.
Its nothing personal George.  Just business.
I lost sight of everything.  Forgot who my friends were.
Your offense?  Why are you here?
What do you got there Diego?
Twentysix months.
Ive got to get out of here Diego.
Yes you have a dream.  And maybe you accomplish your dream.  But yet you failed.  Why?
George?  What do you know about cocaine?
Oh my Gd.
I know.
George.
Theres no room.
Nothing.  Todo esta bien.
Estoy bien okay?  Everything is alright.  Theres no problem.  Okay? This never happened.  No one has to know anything about this.  Diego I want you to calmly tell them where the fucking coke is.  Do it now.
Derek Foreal.
Youd better kill me now Diego because youre a dead man.
Hes in tachycardia.  George your heart is racing.  Have you been using drugs?
Cocaine?  How much?
Yeah layaway.
Surprised to see me?
Thank you.  Have you been getting the money I sent you?
Mirtha comes from a very wealthy family.
So this is the man who takes fifty kilos and makes them disappear in one day?
Un rata  no good.  But he could have run fled the country.  Gone to the policia.  But then his wife his children his parents his friends many people would die.
I like you George.  You are loyal. That is good.  That is rare.  Maybe crazy.  Yes.  I can tell already.  You are like me.  I look at you and I see myself.  Its in the eyes no George?
So you are wanting to sell the cocaine for me in your country George?
Freedom.
George you look terrible.
Please.  Sit down.  Well drink some scotch.
It is very difficult.  Diego makes me a lot of money.  If Diego goes so does the money.  You were an excellent teacher George.  When the student has learned well the teacher is no longer necessary.  We must remember we have wives friends familia.  Even familia that has not been born.  But sometimes we must forget as well.  I am like you. I must teach the lesson.  We want to teach the lesson.  But we cannot.  We must remember that life is the teacher.
Im sorry George.
Theres something out there for me Dad. Something different.  Something free form you know?  Something for me and college just isnt it.
I know.
What are you going to do?
Just low.
Yeah Dad.  I really did.  What am I gonna do?
I know.  Im great at what I do Dad.  I mean Im really great.
No its good.  You have a family.  Its good if it makes you happy.  Its nice to have nice things.  Are you happy son?
Give it to her Dad.  Itll make her happy.
...you sonofabitch.  Putting on Georges boots.
I guess I kind of lost sight of things. May the wind always be at your back and the sun always upon your face and the winds of destiny carry you aloft to dance with the stars.  Love George.
You hear about your old friend Diego?
Look what the cat dragged in.
I dont know.  My name is George.
Look Mirtha.  Shes walking.
Hey why dont you just put a Im doing cocaine sign on the car.  What is your fucking problem?
I havent seen one dollar from you.  You havent paid me one cent in child support alimony.
Yeah?  I better see some money out of it.
Yeah.
I dont know.
California?  You can go anywhere in the world.  India.  Tibet.  Australia. Paris.  And you choose California?
I swear.  On my life.
I fucked up.
Mr. Jung can you describe the circumstances of how you began talking about cocaine with Mr. Delgado?
Youre looking at him.  We provide the plane transportation cost U.S. landing spot and take it to wherever you want it to go.  You provide the pick up point in South America and are responsible for payment.  You assume all the bust risks.  We take sixtyfive percent of all transportation fees ten percent of the gross plus our expenses. This is not a negotiation so if this is okay with you we can talk further.  If not we can forget we had this conversation.
Ramon tells me you are looking for some mota.
Well Ill tell you.  I was walking down the beach minding my business when who did I see but this fucking guy.  I didnt know you guys were living in California.
Im on vacation.  On my way back to school.
Not that far only halfway.  You sure you know what youre doing?
But the NLF has always spoken of a strike as a demonstration ...
In Indochina UtheyU won.
The law is often inconvenient colonel ...

Where were we?
Good thank you Corbiere... . See you tomorrow.
Mathieu Mathieu a name ...
What is she saying?
How you doin Mister D?
I dont think that this is the time or the place.
So she knew about his heart?
Cocaine is the last thing a man in his condition would want.
Doctor McCurdy what was the cause of death?
Then how did it get into his body?
Your Honor the State enters this evidence as exhibit A.  Were any fingerprints found on the bottle?
What would be the effect if someone secretly administered cocaine to Mr. Marsh and then induced him to make love?
Objection Your Honor.
Lookin to make the papers John?
Why would she want that?
I dont buy it and neither will a jury.
You dont know what youre talking about.
Your Honor I dont see a Mr. Roston listed as a prosecution witness.
Did you use it the night Marsh died?
Mr. Marshs Cardiologist and his nurse have told us that you accompanied Mr. Marsh to their office on at least two occasions.
What about Miss Lawson?
Why not?
When you say your sexual relations with Miss Lawson were intense what exactly do you mean?
She told me that tonight we were going to open new doors.  I asked her to stop  to take off the handcuffs but she wouldnt listen.
What did she do next Mr. Roston?

 And what did you suggest?
Well  as I remember it we had an argument.
Yes.
You can suggest anything you want. It happened.

Yes  he mentioned it.

I dont know.  Im not sure.
Dristan nasal spray.
Isnt it true that you put the cocaine in the bottle?
To show you this.  Its a letter from that lawyer Koehler.  He wrote it to me the day after I saw him.  Hes the one who told me I could get the money if Miss Lawson went to jail.
Im not asking for names or specifics.  I just want to know what prompted you to make the call?
Yes.
Do you think I did it?
Frank
Can we get out of here?
Hello?
Hi Frank.
Yeah.
Sorry.
Its going to be hard to convince a jury that hes testifying against you in a murder trial because you blew him off.
Did you always want to be a lawyer?
Yes  it would be nice.
You and me  making love.
I called you all weekend.  Where were you?
What are you going you doing?
You killed him  didnt you?
You killed him.  You killed him  and I got you off.

I love you.
Because Im expecting a call.
Do it quickly Mr. Dulaney.
Youre on vacation remember?  Youre supposed to be relaxing.

I do not need instructions from you to bathe  I knew youd do this I knew Id come all the way here and be shut out as usual I came to be here for you I didnt have to come  Lord knows I was never much welcome in this house before. Apparently dead or alive nothings changed.
Carolyn  you want these candlesticks?
Lawyer here?
What?
 going over and over in my mind every detail every moment of our time together and I ask myself What happened to me in Madison County? I struggle to put it together in a way that allows me to continue knowing were on separate roads. But then I look through the lens of my camera and youre there. I start to write an article and I find myself writing it to you. Its clear to me now we have been moving towards each other towards those four days all our lives 
Robert Jesus Ill kill him.
Wait a minute That was thirty years after daddy. Do you think...?
What are you doing?
Hes getting her drunk. Thats what happened. Jesus maybe he forced himself. Thats why she couldnt tell us.
He remarried. Apparently they were having an affair for years. Apparently the first Mrs. Delaney was a bit of a stiff.
Nobody did.
Everything was during Betty. God we were so young. Why did we think we had to do it all so fast? Ive never cheated on Betty. Not once we were married I mean.
Only about a thousand times. What do I do now? Whats good enough for mom is good enough for me?
My niece had the changes when she was thirtyone.
Madge. Please. Somethings happened. Ive met someone. Ive fallen in love in a way Ive never thought could happen my entire life. Its our last day together. I feel like Im going to die when he leaves. Please. Help me.
No no. I just didnt sleep well. Im not used to sleeping alone. And this heat. Would you mind?
Well youre pretty close. Its only about two miles from here.
Theres a wonderful smell about Iowa  very particular to this part of the country. Do you know what I mean?
Small town on the Eastern side no ones ever heard of called Bari.
Are you by nature a sadistic person?
Hes very... clean.
I better go. You sure youre all right?  Its been a pleasure. Sincerely.
Help cook?
Why did you stop?
Do you miss it?
Im sorry. That was...
This ... Of what I call God and fools can Nature. Who wrote that?
You really dont need anyone?
Do you ever regret it? The divorce I mean.
Do you ever regret not having a family?
Im sorry I didnt call sooner but I just read your note. I stuffed it into my pocket. The light was fading and I had to get my shot.
Its Robert.
Would you like a beer for your bath?
Are you comfortable?  Do you... want to move to the bedroom?
Yes.
I just feel like Im getting a little ... out of control thats all. Its kind of frightening.
Where? Near the doorway or the near the front of the church?
Good. More coffee?  Robert I hope you dont mind my asking but I feel like I should.
Routine I dont have a routine. And if you think thats what this is 
Well why is that up to me? Youre the one whos married. You told me you have no intention of leaving your husband.
What do you want me to say?
I told you I wont apologize for who I am.
No they dont say much. But Carolyns 16. Shes just about to find out about all this for herself  shes going to fall in love shes going to try and figure out how to build a life with someone. If I leave what does that say to her?
Robert. Please.  You dont understand  no one does. When a woman makes the choice to marry to have children  in one way her life begins but in another way it stops. You build a life of details. You become a mother a wife and you stop and stay steady so that your children can move. And when they leave they take your life of details with them. And then youre expected move again only you dont remember what moves you because no one has asked in so long. Not even yourself. You never in your life think that love like this can happen to you.
Mrs. Johnson Mrs. Johnson Is it true Cary Grant has proposed to you?

Whats wrong?
Yes there is.  I felt it this morning when I brought you the coffee.
Because its the truth.
I know what I am.  I dont need to have it tattooed on my shoulder.
I dont.
The difference is I can have sex with someone I just met someone I hardly know but to steal I need to know someone like I know myself.
You said he washed the money?
What happened?
What time did you say they would be there?
Where will you be?
I still dont see how Im going to get clean with the money in the apartment.  Everyone will think I did it.

There are some real bastards in this department who dont mind breaking a few eggs to make an omelette but thank God there are the new boys like me who want to maintain decent civilized standards of terrorist eradication. Weve got the upper hand for the moment but theyre waiting for us to slip up and a little slip up like this is just the chance theyre looking for.

What am I going to to do with this guy?  Pierce I was just on the phone with Borough Command. Out of twelve shifts this month youve been late for nine sick four and that includes the shift where you came late and went home early.
Nobody tells me to fire anyone. I told them shove it up the big one.  Sorry.  I said you want to fire him come over and do it yourself.
Youre late Pierce. I know but I cant fire you. Ive got nobody to work sixteen XRay with Walls.

IB Bangin.
What the hell.  The next year tiebreaker for the division in Boston Yanks down two to nothing Bucky Dent steps to the plate.
Hes very very sick.
I wouldnt do that.  The doctor seems to think hes suffering from some rare disorder.
Its the waiting thats killing me not knowing you know? Its really hard on my mother. The doctor doesnt think my fatherll make it. He says he was dead too long after six minutes the brain starts to die and once that goes close the door.
I mean if he was dead I could handle that.
Right now Im more worried about my mother than anything. They wont let her see my father.
You shouldnt smoke.
My fathers in a coma now my mothers going crazy. Its like shes in a trance.
Sleeping.

On yeah? I went to Holy Name. Whered you go to high school?
Excuse me. You seemed like you were in trouble.
Dont seem so bad to me.
I just have to relax a little. Not feel so guilty all the time.
Mary. Mary weve got to get going.
Who is it?
Nobody gets fired. Look at me. Only thing they might do is transfer you to the Bronx. You look like you aged ten years since I rode with you last.
No you never listened. I was going man if someone on high hadnt pulled me in. I had put all I had into saving this dumbass lowlife suicidal that when he went down there was a part of me that wanted to go with him.
Whos that?
Went over to Sals got this. There must be some place in Hell for a guy who sells a dollarfifty a slice. I call you if anything comes up.
Rule number one Dont get involved with patients. Rule number two Dont get involved with patients daughters. You understand?

Youre in the stomach
Zebra are you there? Im holding an unconscious at First and St. Marks.
Hi Aaron...Whats doing?
Dont name them.  Just tell me if you know.
Dont let your eyes go from the beginning of the sentence to the end like that.  You dont want to look shifty do you?
Impossible.  Theres no system that wouldnt value one of us.
You packing up tonight?
Yes.  Youre not going to stick around for the farewell party?
He excels at gratitude.
Thats your full name?
I might as well ask you the questions on tape.  Is that all right?
Eventually rising to...
Nine seconds.
I didnt sleep.  Theyre giving me less and less air time.  They dont think Im at all anchor material.
I think the pilot that shot down the Libyan in 1981 is stationed right here.  Maybe you could get him  and maybe Tom should say that our F14 is one of the hardest planes to fly. Theyre nicknamed Tomcats.
Tom...why dont I meet you there? Ive got some last minute stuff Ive got to take care of...Hey how did you resolve your dilemma  did you rent the tux or buy it...I knew it. How much?  Wow...Okay...See you there...
I read about it  thats how you can make sure you dont put on too much perfume...
Howd it go?
Then what was good about it?
Stop kidding.  I want to know what happened.
If all that happened how come youre so chipper?
I know you care about him.  Ive never seen you like this about anyone so please dont take it wrong when I tell you that I believe that Tom while a very nice guy is the Devil.
Why not try it for a few weeks?
I like it  So doll what about you lately?
Okay.
Prepare what?  You have Saturdays news handy?
You think anyone whos proud of the work we do is an ass kisser.
Id like to take everyone out after the show.
Did you hear what I just said  do you have that?  Take a breath.
Do you know youre the second woman in network news history to produce?
Because...
You know I like Tom because hi...
Yes.  Thats right.
No...no.
...and the White House is hoping to keep a lid on it for a few days till they figure out what to do.
I wish it were you giving the story.
Hey Buddy dont do that anymore.
Good.  Hes on the worlds longest ego trip let him take it alone.
How horrible.  Well be fine.  Youll be fine.  Stay here with me  well go for a drive have some drinks make happy plans.
Tom isnt ready for the job youre about to hand him.  Not near ready.  Not by the longest shot.  Aarons spent six weeks in Tripoli hes interviewed Gaddafi  he reported on the Eightone story.  I think hes essential to do the job were capable of and I think its my responsibility to tell you that.
It must be nice to always believe you know better.  To think youre always the smartest person in the room.
Yes.  My room is down here  Im not tired.  Do you want to keep talking?
Its hard for me to advise you since you personify something that I truly think is dangerous.
I thought you were incredible in there. I know how much I have to learn.  Id really  a lot  appreciate it...if...
Can I buy you dinner sometime soon?
So he was indicted?
The House Armed Service Committee has a secret report which says that the General Stillwell tank the Army has dumped a fortune into plain wont work.  I have it cold confirmed.  They have five million dollars in this thing already.
Nervous?
Theres no gang in there  We were the last ones.
Come on Ill buy you a drink. Theres a big thing over at the Italian embassy.
Im going to have to do a story from beginning to end on my own.
Im not sure I dialed right  Jane?
Its not important.
What pills did you take?  You sound more like someone on a general anesthetic.  Maybe Id better speak to you tomorrow.
So what did you think?
Youre not going to take off on me are you?
What?
Thats not it.
Jane Im not some chore you have to finish so you can stay on schedule.
Why?
I felt funny about it afterwards.  Its verboten huh?  I thought since I did it for real the first time  but I get you.  Thats not the reason youre not coming?
I got promoted for things like that.
Thats not going to be the way we say goodbye.  Even though I think what you did was rotten  its not all impersonal.  You mean something to me.
So you have an extra bathing suit huh?
This is very awkward.
Look Im junior man  and its your beat.
I converted a bedroom  this stuff builds up.  Wait till youve been doing this sixteen years.
Thats enough.  Thats enough.
Thats not true I am a sculptor
Well Im touched.  Youre serious arent you?

That doesnt look like very much clay.
Walter can I ask you something?
Alright were clear.
Yeah hes keeping an eye out said hed call us if he sees anything. Thats about it for tonight.
See you later 
Its called spontaneity Leonard. Get with the program.
How did you ever find it all in yourself Walter?
These guys came by to help me try out some of my new organic recipes.

Did you hear what he said?
I know what it is to be ignored.
Walter...stay away from me
Ah your new head shot...  I like it very much...
Are you alright?
Carla and I will guide you help develop and evolve your work...maybe lead you toward something more abstract...
Walter what are you doing?
Whered ya buy that?
Yeah.
You want to buy it put it in the club?
Well...why did you put a knife in it?
Look go home and...work on something. Make another cat.
You didnt mean to what?
Its hot in here...
A show?  Like this Sunday?
Maxwell  Hes behind all this with all his stupid blowhard poetry  Listen youve got to stop right away  Im beginning to feel responsible
Police officer.
But I got a feeling youre gonna cooperate with me.  Yessir I think you and me are gonna be real good friends.  Why dont you tell me about your connection.
I didnt do nothing wrong  That was Mayolias  I didnt ask her for it.  I dont know about any 
YOURE GONNA SHOOT ME
I dont think anyone gets what I said their blank faces staring mute unfeeling 
Wheat germ omelette guava nectar and garbanzo sprinkled with smoked yeast.  Join us?
An everyone will say Walter let me shake your hand...its a real pleasure to have known you...
I wont say good luck Walter.
Its like...youve turned on.
Let me into your world Walter... let me into that white hot inspired world.
Uh Mrs. Swicker I got to meet some friends later and I have to take a shower
I will  good night Mrs. Swicker
I dont think this is gold.
I like it.  Can I be your friend?
Nice to feel needed.
Man has a complex.
No we didnt.
Come on come on fork up the scub.
Its coffee.
Let me in Pike  Im hungry
Did you see a girl come by here?
Wheels?
Hi Buffy.
He doesnt look fifty.
Oh.  Whos in it?  I know what it is.  Its whats on instead of the movie.
Where were you last night?  I called your house like four times.
I can take care of myself Jeffrey.
You left me a message?
This?  This is you only weapon? Your puny faith?
I am a God  A God
You want some water or something?
You had a car full of stuff.  Were you leaving?
Well stay here tonight.
Hey jeez are you okay?  You need a hand?
Things are kind of confusing.
I didnt expect to see you.
Dress huh?  What for?
Right.  Im the chosen one.  And I choose to be shopping.
Im going out the front.
It has to be like a socially conscious theme.
Bugs.
Like what?
What are we doing?
Wait a minute.  My birthright is in the graveyard?  Later not.
Let me get this straight.  Youre like this greasy bum and I have to go to the graveyard with you cause Im chosen and theres vampires.
Just stay away from me okay?
I was a slave.
How do you know all this?
Wheres the other one?
Go to school tomorrow.  Try to act normal.  Dont let anyone know whats happening.  This is important. When the vampires find out who you are... you wont be hunting them anymore.
Meet me at this address after school.
Why do you keep saying that?
What?
Not a pressing issue.
Uh... gym.
Put your head back.
No... I guess I would have gotten Jeffrey to hit you.
What about bats?  Do they turn into bats?
And the alley was a mistake.  Never corner yourself like that.  If theyd come at you in force youd be dead now.  One vampire is a lot easier to kill then ten.
A wet  Didnt I just kill that vampire?  I think I did.  I didnt see you killing any vampires.  You were too busy playing Beat the Clock.
Do you know how many girls Ive trained to be Slayers?  Five.  Five properly prepared girls girls who faced their responsibilities who worked hard to become women overnight  harder than youve ever worked in your life  and I saw them ripped apart.  Do you want to live?  Do you?
So basically Ive got the life expectancy of a zit right?
I mean most of the time Jeffreys really sweet but sometimes he gets kind of... MeTarzanish you know what I mean?  Lately it bugs me I guess.  Merrick?  Are you still breathing?
I want to die.
Interesting.
There isnt time.
Oh Ill be there all right.  Im not letting you out of my sight. Not till youre ready.
Mr. Howard is so heinous.  Hes always giving me a hard time.  I get a Cplus on the test and he tells me You have no sense of history.  I have no sense of history?  He wears a brown tie.
You guys blow.  Im waiting on Cassandra.  Shes gonna help me with my history.
Well I guess you got what you came for.
No wait.  I can be dumb.  Really. Or mean or whatever.  I can learn. Im useful.
The mark of the Coven.
But as long as there have been vampire there has been the Coven the line of Slayers.  Ones with the strength and the skill to kill them to find them where they gather and stop the swell of their numbers. One dies the next is called.
What are you grinning at?  You think I was scared?
You think so?
Write that down.
Okay lets go.
I cant believe they still ate it.
I got all the plastic stuff.  What should I do with it?
And Spring Fling.
She was even crazier after that.  I mean it you wouldnt even have recognized her.
Omniplex?
Youre kidding.
Oh my God  Ouch  No wonder you quit.
Environment.  Thats cool with me.
Oh yeah
Buffy the apewoman.
Where am I gonna find another mechanic stupid enough to work for my money?
I want you to wear these on the road trip when you pitch.
Youve been pitching out of the wrong side of your brain.  Thesell help move things to the right side.
Sorry.  You look great.  Im totally exhausted.
How was that?
Im yours.
Im so proud of you and all the guys.  Want some more soup?
Thats my leg.
Nuke  You got things all wrong Theres no relation between sex and baseball.  Ask Crash.
Whatd he say?
I couldnt dump my old man but maybe later I can sneak away from him...
I gotta leave first thing in the morning.
Neither will I.
Young men are uncomplicated.  And hes not dim.  Hes just inexperienced.  My job is to give him lifewisdom and help him make it to the major leagues.
Your place or mine?
Well Annie your place or mine?
And now you wanta teach me?
...  so you see in a former lifetime Im sure that I was Alexandria the Czarette of Russia? What do you think?
Salem Massachusetts?  Where all the witches were?
Annie
Oh nohes shaking off the sign Jackson.  Big mistake...
God bless you.
You missed the tag
Fun?  Whats he know about fun?  Whys he calling for a curveball? I wanta bring heat.

You dont have to have a license to work in a casino. All you gotta do is apply for one. The state law says you can work in a casino while theyre processing your application. They got a tenyear backlog.

But I saw it another. I saw it as untouched. I mean they had bookies pimps and drug dealers I could shake down. Who the fuck were they gonna run to?  So I started getting everybody in line. Best of all for the first time in my life I figured out a way not to lose.
...Nicky was dreamin his own kind of Vegas.
If he does it again hes out for good. I dont care what it is Nick Im gonna ha Ill  Ill never let him in the place again.
Hey I gotta give the guy credit. He does the most obvious thing. This is the only town in the country where a bookie joint is legit so why not take advantage right?  So... he took bookie joints off the street and then opened them up inside the casino. Well within a few years by doin all of this he had every casino on the Strip trying to copy off him.
You better watch yourself. Theres a lot of heat on you already.
Motherfucker.  Unsavory fuckin... Is there any way around this?
In other words Im fucked.
Yeah Nicky loved restaurants. He was a real restaurant buff. And over the years he always made money with them.
No no its okay.
I have no control over that. Ronnie and Billy were right there. Theyll tell you exactly what happened.
Looks bad? Im gonna tell you what looks bad.
Nicky was questioned in two dozen murders but they always had to let him go. There were never any witnesses.
What  what Caesars?
You want me to get out of my own fuckin town?

Tonight somewhere in the city innocent people will diebut then one of you knows that for one of you is a vicious pirateterrorist posing as the beloved superhero Captain God.
In many ways that obnoxious creep Cactus was the worst one of all. He got off on giving out pain...
I thought you said you werent a very good liar.
Women huh?
Were waiting.
But then we knew that all along didnt we...
Catwomen. Lots of them

Oh Honey its so much better when we do it without the helmet.
Bossman what were you going on about last night I am the Law and I am the Danish...

I want out of tonights mission. I cant do it anymore Captain. I cant let innocent people die to prove our superiority..I cant.
I loved you.
My those little ears pick up a lot. The Cult of Good will die heroically preventing a worldclass heist. Since we will be the ones performing the heist our deaths will obviously be fake. But have no fear. There will be many other deaths tomorrow...and those will be quite real. Im afraid these questions of yours put you in a position not unlike a longtailed tabby in room full of rocking chairs.
Im supposed to be taking personality tips from you three?  You people were once heroes. You had ideals.  You fought for things.  Spooky told me so...
I heard what you said Spooky. I cant believe he shot you...
You Housewives have no idea what we go through

What was that for?
So what?  What could be important enough to put your hands on me?
She cant  Its busted.  Now hand that on back
Whats this?
In case you crapped out it was my job to go after that briefcase.
I told you I shouldve cuffed him.
Hes seen both of us now.
I dont like anybody laying their hands on me.
If you know that just back off.
First off this Mr. Chow Yen doesnt speak a lot of English. The girl with him will interpret. There will be a third person to accompany you into the mens room where you can take count.  I hope you know Krugerands better than they know a uHockneyu.

Weve almost got your husband and your daughter out.  So dont get any ideas.
So far theyre keeping their part of it.
For Christ sakes dont point it at me.  We want to get Rachel out of there in one piece.  Im waiting for the girl.  Her mother wants to talk to her.
Your friends are probably still on the line.  Pick it up and say hello.
Those shots your associates got off may not have done him too much good.  Thats on their head.  All I did I was put him there.
Im still okay.
Do you think theyll walk away?
Wonderful feeling of security knowing your adversaries are both crippled and unarmed.

Whats really on your wicked little mind?
Whats your point?
Maybe your friends already accomplished that chore for us.
Im going to cuff you and leave you in that house.  It may take awhile but youll be found after were long gone.

Thats how it is.  You see her approaching you toss out installment one.
Seems like it.
Youre going to have to see to it that both lanes of this road get blocked.

How come all these new names are pasted into the plat book?
Theyre calling it an accident.
Lou Escobar  hes a Lieutenant.
Oh yes.
Far as it goes. Of course he has to swim in the same water we all do.
...Exactly what do you know about me Mr. Gittes?
Course Im respectable. Im old. Politicians ugly buildings and whores all get respectable if they last long enough. Ill double whatever your fees are and Ill pay you ten thousand dollars if you can find Hollis girlfriend.
Yes his girlfriend.
Yes. Shes disappeared hasnt she?
No.
Just find the girl.
How do you do that?
Of course I do. Where are you?
What are you talking about?
Youre absolutely right I wouldnt give her another thought.
Thanks Curly. Call me Jake.
...No...
How much do you owe me Curly?
Thanks Lou.
Congratulations.
Looking for someone.
What are you doing here?
You were following him night and day. You saw who killed him. You even took pictures of it. It was Evelyn Mulwray. Shes been paying you off like a slot machine ever since her husband died.
Yeah I once knew a whore who for enough money would piss in a customers face but shed never shit on his chest. Thats where she drew the line.
I know what he says.
No Gittes youll show us.
Well lets go.
You never learn do you Gittes?
...Well it didnt make him happy...
Mr. Gittes.
Will you need me for anything else Lieutenant?
What?
May I speak frankly Mrs. Mulwray?
Mrs. Mulwray Im afraid thats not good enough.
Well I suppose I am... actually I knew about the affair.
Mr. Gittes.
You mustve had a reason to ask me that.
You seem to have had a reason for every other question.
How did it happen?
Whoevers behind my husbands death why have they gone to all this trouble?
Is there something upsetting about my asking about your father?
Everything you can see everything around us. I was at the Hall of Records today.  That bother you?
Yeah. Theyve been blowing these farmers out of here and buying their land for peanuts. Have any idea what this landll be worth with a steady water supply? About thirty million more than they paid.
Youre looking at the owners of a 50000 acre empire.
Tell me something. Does this usually happen to you Mr. Gittes?
Hold still. Why?
Where are you going?
I know.
Yes.
I cant...
Dont worry. Im not telling anybody about this.
Let me handle that.
Walsh here?
Jesus Christ this guys really got water on the brain.
Well Im a working girl Mr. Gittes. I didnt come in to see you on my own.
Oh my goodness.
Theres just one question.
Just to be certain I wonder if you could show us a list of your patients?
I wonder is it too late for us to have a look around?
Can I help you?  Russ Yelburton Deputy Chief in the Department.
He never even kids about it.
Relax Mulvihill glad to see you.  Do you know Claude Mulvihill here?
You ought to be more careful. That must really smart.
Mr. Gittes youre not making a bit of sense.
Jake whatre you doin here?
Yeah.
The L.A. River?
Ida Sessions wants to see you.
How do you do Mrs. Mulwray?
Lot of turnover these days. Better tell them to get in touch with me if they want to hang onto their land.
Mr. Yelburton will be busy for some time.
Hes liable to be tied up indefinitely.
Think you can nail Mulvihill? Theyll claim you were trespassing.
Neither do I.
That right?... She used to be some looker.
She must be about thirtythree thirty four.
Oh you know. She was sixteen or seventeen.
Cause sometimes you cant find the right place any more and so...well actually...they stay here.  Besides there are more kisses than you can count.
What are you doing here?
Because I dont want to Toto This is not a job for you. Its like being a slave. Youre always alone. You see the same film over and over again because you have nothing else to do. And you start talking to Greta Garbo and Tyrone Power like a nut You work on holidays on Christmas on Easter. Only on Good Friday are you free. But if they hadnt put Jesus Christ on a cross...Youd work Good Fridays too
Yes. I want proof.
Now what can you see?
You see it s like I say. You always have an answer for everything.
Toto are you pulling my leg or something? How is it possible to see this television without film?
Listen to this one...The commander says to the sergeant You remember that windmill that used to be there? Yes sir I remember the mills gone but the winds still there  You remember the story of the soldier and the princess? 
Father I have sinned...
You have a great future as a driver. If they dont arrest you first
So whatd they say?
Alfredo died. Do you remember him?
Its the first time Ive had to chance to tell the story. I never mentioned it to anybody.
Daddys not coming back...Hes dead. 
Thats fine Mr. Kane.
Three cents.
This is all figured at three cents a copy.
My Declaration of Principles   Dont smile Brad   Take dictation Mr. Bernstein 
You dont wanta make any promises Mr. Kane you dont wanta keep.
Its wonderful Mr. Kane.  Wonderful. Wonderful.
Go in and ask him to hurry.
Hes a great guy  Leland.  Whyd he ever leave New York?
Yes.  I thought it was a good idea. Weve covered it from the news end of course.
Who else did you see?
He finished it.  He wrote the worst notice I ever read about the girl he loved.  We ran it in every paper.
The way things turned out I dont need to tell you  Miss Emily Norton was no rosebud
Mr. Leland why didnt you go to Europe with him?  He wanted you to.  He said to me just yesterday 
Mr. Bernstein am I a stuffed shirt? Am I a horsefaced hypocrite?  Am I a New England schoolmarm?
Whats happened?
If you hadnt come along and protected me when you did Id have killed them fellows.
Where is it  wheres my notice? Ive got to finish it
I suppose hes fixing it up  I know Id never get that through.
You may resume your work gentlemen.  I didnt know your plans and so I was unable to make any preparations.
But a morning newspaper Mr. Kane. After all were practically closed twelve hours a day  except for the business offices 
Thats the kind of thing we are going to be interested in from now on Mr. Carter.  Right now I wish youd send your best man up to see Mr. Silverstone.  Have him tell Mr. Silverstone if he doesnt produce his wife at once the Enquirer will have him arrested.  Have him tell Mr. Silverstone hes a detective from the Central Office. If Mr. Silverstone asks to see his badge your man is to get indignant and call Mr. Silverstone an anarchist. Loudly so that the neighbors can hear.
But Mr. Kane 
Mr. Kane this is a surprise
Yes Mr. Kane.
Im sorry I sent for you Brad  I didnt 
Almost two to one 
Emily
I know it is Brad 
Oh yes there is.
Theres only one person in the world to decide what Im going to do  and thats me.  And if you think  if any of you think 
Youve got some on your face.
Whats funny now?
Oh
A chicken?
Excuse me Mr. Kane.  I know this takes a lot of nerve but  who are you?  I mean  Im pretty ignorant I guess you caught on to that 
I didnt think you did.  If you had I wouldnt have asked you again because Id have remembered. How old?
What happened to the singing? Youre not in a show are you?
Would you sing for me?
I couldnt make you see how I felt Charlie.  I just couldnt   I couldnt go threw with singing again. You dont know what it means to feel  to know that people  that an audience dont want you.  That if you havent got what they want  a real voice  they just dont care about you.  Even when theyre polite  and they dont laugh or get restless or  you know... They dont want you.  They just 0
I mean in New York.
Its not a habit.  I do it because I like it.
I mean it.  Oh I know I always say I mean it and then I dont  or you get me so I dont do what I say Im going to  but 
Well Im not going to stop it.  Im going to say exactly what I think.  Youve never given me anything.  Youve tried to buy me into giving you something.  Youre    its like you were bribing me  Thats what its been from the first moment I met you.  No matter how much it cost you  your time your money  thats what youve done with everybody youve ever known.  Tried to bribe them
It is the unanimous opinion of my Cabinent  in which I concur  that the proposed leases are in the best interests of the Governement and the people.  You are not I hope suggesting that these interests are not indentical?
I know the facts Mr. Kane.  And I happen to have the incredible insolence to differ with you as to what they mean.  Youre a man of great talents Mr. Kane.
You goin Mom?
I came to see you Charles about your  about the Enquirers campaign against the Metropolitan Transfer Company.
Mr. Thatcher isnt everything Ive been saying in the Enquirer about the traction trust absolutely true?
Mrs. Kane would like to see you Mr. Kane.
Oh yes sir.
Charles I tell you there is no war Theres a condition that should be remedied  but between that and a 
Say Brad.  Ive got an idea.
Id like to talk to you about that.
First of all I will not write a good review of a play because somebody paid a thousand dollars for an advertisement in the Enquirer.
All right.
She hasnt any friends left sine you started this oil business and she never sees you.
You still want to be transferred to the other paper?
Well withdraw support completely. Anything else?
Oh yes the bonus.
It does seem too good to be true doesnt it Mr. Bernstein?
Youre going to live with Mr. Thatcher from now on Charlie  Youre going to be rich.  Your Ma figures  that is er  she and I have decided that this isnt the place for you to grow up in. Youll probably be the richest man in America someday and you ought to 
Mr. Leland you were 
Sorry Mr. Leland.
Whats this?
I guess maybe Im not as hard to see through as I think.  Anyway I never even answered his letter. Maybe I should have.  I guess he was pretty lonely down there those last years.  He hadnt finished it when she left him  he never finished it  he never finished anything.  Of course he built it for her 
Yes and maybe he didnt.
Thompson
Yes sir  yes sir I knew how to handle the old man.  He was kind of queer but I knew how to handle him.
I didnt get a thing.  Just the music lessons.  Thats all there was to it.
Ill come down in a week or so and see her again.  Say you might be able to help me.  When she used to talk about Kane  did she ever happen to say anything  about Rosebud?
How long have you been smoking?
Thanks. Have a good one.
I think youd better leave now.
Dick.
So where is he?
Am I missing something here?
Why?
My God. I havent seen you since... 
Train. It took eight hours.
You saw it?
Im not pregnant.
I wouldve told you and you would have stopped calling like a baby.
Because I know you. You prefer drastic measures to rational ones.
Then my mother called me this morning and told me the announcement was in the paper. Thats when I hopped the train to come back here because I knew youd be a wreck.
Im giving him his ring back.
If Im so nuts about you then why am I having sex with an Asian design major?
You work in a market all right.
Youre such an asshole.
I can already tell this isnt going to work.
And the fact that there werent any lights made it so...  God That was so great
Yeah right. Who was it Randal?
Then who operated the store?
Using filthy language in front of the customers... you should both get fired.
Fuck in a second This is... Look at you You cant even pass
Like youre better
Thats easy to say from over here.
My point is that youre a clerk paid to do a job. You cant just do anything you want while youre working.
All right now if youre really feeling dangerous tonight then Smokey and the Bandit Three is the movie you must rent.
You only brought one ball?
Someone jammed gum in the locks.
Thats what I said.
One fight a day with Veronica is about all I can stomach thanks.
Party at John Kssenior year. I get blitzed and pass out in his bedroom. Caitlin comes in and dives all over me.
All four?
Empire.
Whats that?
Yeah.
Well the thing is the first Death Star was manned by the Imperial army storm troopers dignitariesthe only people onboard were Imperials.
Exactly. In order to get it built quickly and quietly theyd hire anybody who could do the job. Do you think the average storm trooper knows how to install a toilet main?  All they know is killing and white uniforms.
Whats he looking for?
Its not like you laid the eggs yourself.
Think of the weirdest craziest shit youd like to see chicks do.  These chicks do it all. They insert things into any opening in their body... any opening.  Hes led a very sheltered life.
There arent.
Its not really anyone per se its more of separate groupings.
Vermont?
Dont yell at me pal.
I havent seen her in almost two years.
What?
Im not taking you to this funeral.
I cant close the store.
Shut the hell up.
Because I never tried to suck my own dick?
Yeah. Like you said you know. I guess everyone tries it sooner of later.
Her fucking body fell out
The reasons you wont let me borrow your car is because I have a title and a job description and Im supposed to follow it right?
I thought you never sold cigarettes to kids.
Youre lying.
Then why arent you like screaming at me right now?
Now I know youre lying.
Youre kidding.
Hey what about Veronica?
You just fucked a total stranger?
She said she did all the work.
Yeah you should shit or get off the pot.
It is. You just up and quit. There are other jobs and they pay better money. Youre bound to be qualified for at least one of them. So whats stopping you?
Whore you kidding? You can so.
Lovely story.
To talk to you.
Its not like Im miles away.
To say the least.
Hes got those love handles.
Do I know you?
Im surprised you never found out about it Dante. Everybody in school kneweven in my class.
Yes they are. Youre out of shape.
Pretty girl about this girls height dark hairgorgeous body?
How many times I gotta tell you not to deal outside the store.
Relax brother. What I mean is that you sell the stuff in this store at the highest prices around. A dollar seventynine for wrapswhats that shit?
At Food City its ninetynine cents plus tax.
So why do you sell it for so much more? Ill tell you whybecause people come here and theyre like A dollar eighty for soda? I should get it at Food City. But I dont feel like driving there. Ill just buy it here so I dont have to drive up there. Thats exploiting a weakness too isnt it?
Thats fucked up. Yo I heard he was jerkin off.
You used to go out with her?
Be careful.
Actually it is kind of rough.
All Im saying is that if youre unhappy you should leave.
I know. I stopped by your house and your mom said you left at like six or something.
Dont you have a hockey game at two?
What were you doing?
Whos fighting? Why are you so defensive?
Youre trusting.
I was kidding.
Three?
Wow. Thats great. Thats something to be proud of.
They put up the least amount of struggle.
Why do you call him that?
You sucked that guys dick?
I did understand I understand that you slept with three different guys and thats all you said.
WHAT? SOMETHING LIKE THIRTYSIX?
What the hell is that anyway something like thirtysix? Does that include me?
What is it?
What did he say?
A couple...?
Youre damn right its not like that Because I wont let it be like that You want your slut? Fine  The slut is yours
You dont know what you want but Im not going to sit here anymore holding your hand until you figure it out Ive encouraged you to get out of this fucking dump and go back to school to take charge of your life and find direction. I even transferred so maybe you would be more inclined to go back to college if I was with you. Everyone said it was a stupid move but I didnt care because I loved you and wanted to see you pull yourself out of this senseless funk youve been in since that whore dumped you oh so many years ago. And now you want to go back to her so she can fuck you over some more?
And having him tell me... that was just the weakest move ever. Youre spineless.
Im not out of shape
Yeah but I didnt sell cigarettes to any kids
Is he staying here?
Let me ask you a question Do you think this guys out of shape?
I think the lady called it.
I beg your pardon
Till ten. Then Im going to John Ks party.

What are we going to do?
Im going with you.
Two...
Do you see them yet?
Thats a virtue isnt it?
Oh my God  I cant recognize the face but the butt does look vaguely familiar. 
Why cant you believe that you did everything you could?
Then turn it off Gabe because it doesnt get any better.
I dont understand?
Excuse me?
A flare up...
Course maybe you dont have to wait until I faint.
If he gets up there and the weather gets as bad as it can theyll never make it down.  He needs someone who has emergency medical training and knows every handhold on these peaks.
Thats not the issue here those people are.  He cant do it alone.
Frank dropped me in the west valley and I hiked.  You look frozen.  Whats happening?
Lets be creative.
Remember the first time we came up here?
Shes a lyin bitch
Im holding you to that.  Gabe what about Frank?
But maybe with a good start I can hit those handholds.
What about you?
Your mouths writing a check your ass cant cash but if ya wanna buy some life bring me the money.
Hell freeze.
Whats he doing?
Souvenirs?  No wrong answer. Looks like your friend plans on hanging around that possible?
For Christs sake theyre kids.
He never hurt anybody.
No the goddamn games not over Its never over when youre playing against a team that doesnt care if they win or lose how do you negotiate with someone like that?
Whats your names?
On top of the peak.

No my health doesnt allow it.
Im so pleased you appreciate good wine. Have another glass
Help you.
So this is the young man?
Very kind of you sir. Thank you very much.
Its past eight Alex you dont want to be late for school son.

No time no time yes. Sit sit sit. Alex sits next to him.
Nobodys got anything on me brother sir. Ive been out of the rookers of the milicents for a long time now.
When you say this funny feeling you mean the state of mind brought on by the treatment they gave you?
And what will you do with the big big money? Have you not everything you need? If you need a motorcar you pluck it from the trees. If you need pretty polly you take it.
Not tonight  not this nochy.
She came towards me with the light like it was the like light of heavenly grace and the first thing that flashed into my gulliver was that I would like to have her right down there on the floor with the old inout real savage. But quick as a shot came the sickness like a detective that had been watching around the corner and now followed to make his arrest. Alex retching. Minister rises.
Good.
Thank you sir.
What job and how much?
No thanks Mum. Itll pass in a minute...  ... What have you done with all my own personal things?
Whats gonna happen to me then? I mean thats my room hes in  theres no denying that. This is my home also. What suggestions have you my Pee and Em to make?
Hello heap of dirt. Pooh you dont wash much do you judging by the horrible smell.
What do I want?
Yes sir.
Pick that up and put it down properly. Alex does so and continues to empty his pockets.
Youre absolutely right sir.
Indeed it is. May I take this She removes his tray.
Something like that. You are a little undernourished so after each meal were going to give you a shot. Roll over on your right side please loosen your pyjama pants and pull them halfway down. He does somewhat reluctantly. She gives him a shot in the bum.
Well of course it was horrible. Violence is a very horrible thing. Thats what youre learning now. Your body is learning it.
How are you feeling today?
Im your Psychiatrist.
Good. The boy you always quarrelled with is seriously ill.
Good. What do you want?
Fucking hell...
I hope so. Is that the end then?
I was quite enjoying that.
Can you spare me some cutter me brother? Can you spare some cutter me brother? Alex without looking at him reaches in his pocket and gives him some money.
Father  may I ask you a question in private?
I dont care about the danger Father. I just want to be good. I want for the rest of my life to be one act of goodness.
I dont understand about the whys and wherefores Father. I only know I want to be good.
One jacket  blue pinstripe.

...so his description of Max the cabdriver matches the guy who walked out of Villa Rodeo.  That guy?  That guy is a cabbie.  And youre telling me this cabbie walks into a phone booth and emerges as a meat eater assassin with heavy trigger time? Whats he do squeeze em in between fares?
Dmitri uGusunov?u What the fuck why? Forget about Dimitri Feds are all over him.  Theyre a heartbeat away from taking him down.  Words gone out they dont want us anywhere near him...

Max?  What are you doing?
Dont even think youre walking away from me.
Mom Vincents not interested.
You take one more step Ill kill her.
Hey Im not the one whos been lying to my mother.
Its cause they dont like their lives so they project their patterns of negative behavior onto you...  I had a father like that.
He hated everything I did.  Hated me. Got drunk and beat the shit out of me daily...
Well this big stakes got to be big by now.  When you leaving?
How long have you been a hit man?

Testing some top secret seismic weapon.
You going to warn him?

People do have heart attacks.
I wont be here when you get back but Ill be in touch.  And thanks.
Lucky guess... Um Id feel a lot less naked if we could get outta here.
Well thats the eye right there. uMoneyu.  And all the power and misery it brings with it. Its a plot to take over the world.  The Master Conspiracy. Can take a lifetime to pull off.
So why are they after you?
You okay?
Stone is their spokesman.  You think if someone really had all that information and a national podium to shout it out from that theyd let him do it?  Stones a disinformation flunky.  The face that hes alive says it all.
Yeah... how many subscribers do you have?
Who are you Jerry?
You gave me an hour now give me a day.
I didnt mean for you to see it. Its like looking in someones diary and taking it out of context.  Know what I mean?
Did you see the van back there?
Jesus... Its my fault.  They drew a black line over me and now Im passing it on.  Im passing it to you too.
Maybe you better not try... I worked so hard to keep quiet. Like a mouse.  I should have realized.
Cold Wars over Jerry.
And you think Group One is at war with Group Two.
Do you watch the news?  Read the paper.  Last week this whole place was underwater.
You will?
I know that.  Im just  Im nervous.  I reached out and grabbed the first thing out there. I know theyre song lyrics.  And I know how I feel.
Yeah...  Would you I mean could you love me then?  If I was normal.  Maybe?
Are you okay?  I wish I hadnt told you what I did.  But I cant help the way I feel.  You dont hold that against me do you?
Now what?
How do you really know theres gold in Fort Knox?  Just because they say so?  We should go to Tennessee and demand to see it.
Then why did you have his picture in your safe deposit box?
Blue moon... Blue moon...
How did you know?
I love you too.
You shouldnt watch Jerry.  Its a moment without hope.
Liza Sutton is dead.
Im not a violent man Mr. Lowry. Not by nature anyhow.  But if you hurt Liza in any way Ill kill you.  Does that seem honorable?
Thats not what I mean.  I want to see her.
Then screw you.  Ill rot.
And you feel bad for it?
And you have no idea where he lives?
A charming term.  Now uwhy himu?
I didnt know the C.I.A. had psychiatrists.
These things youre talking about. You did them to Jerry?
It was my fathers.  Kept it in his wallet.  He was murdered 
In Jerrys safety deposit box.
Hmm how about tomorrow night?
Im not that good at no Liza.
Liza settle a bet for us.
The office is closed for the evening. Is this an emergency?
Ive been given a cease and desist on all matters relating to Jerry Fletcher.  Were not to discuss him with the press the N.Y.P.D. anyone.  Building police are to arrest him on sight and were to report any attempt he makes to contact you.
Jonas?
Whos the Deputy Director of the F.B.I.?
That you come with me.
... And this is how the extraterrestrial presented himself to you?  As your father?
He died...  ... in 1972.
Mike because of the Earths rotation were only in line with Vega so many hours a day the only way to get the whole message is to cooperate with other stations.  If Dr. Arroway hadnt moved quickly we could have lost key elements.
Hope theres a cartoon.
Im not.  Youre far too promising a scientist to waste your considerable gifts on this nonsense 
Two  Theres nothing out there but noble gasses and carbon compounds and youd be wasting your time.
Pepsi?  Tequila?
No... Youre not.  But the price has just gotten too high.
Then why havent you detected any signals?  If as you claim there have been thousands millions of advanced civilizations out there for millions of years then why hasnt one signal gotten through?  Itll take a month or two for the paperwork to go through youre welcome to stay until then.
The theological ramifications of all this are obvious the President feels we need to include religious interests rather than alienate them. Shes also named Palmer Joss as their liaison hes requested a meeting with you.
Apparently hes genuinely interested in science.  This could be a chance to win him over.
Ms. President this is communist paranoia right out of War of the Worlds.  There is no reason whatsoever to believe the ETIs intentions are hostile.  We pose no threat to them  it would be like us going out of our way to destroy microbes on a beach in Africa.
They knew our level of development. If as you say theyve done this many times theyd be well aware of the implications.
You arent staying?
Right.  Well.
Ellie... we both know that if I was any kind of a man I never wouldve entered this race.  That I would have told the President straight out  Helen Eleanor Arroway is naive and strident and an enormous pain in the ass... but shes got more courage and intelligence than the rest of us put together.  That more then anyone else on the planet shes earned this.  And that she should be the one to go because shes the best we have.  But thats not who I am.  I like to think its who I mightve been if things had gone a different way that I might have been worthy really worthy of what Ive been given...  You do what you have to do.  And in the end as with everything it comes down to power.  And it isnt fair...
What does it say?
Because you cut it from the budget three years running.
Mr. Ranks organization represents the point of view of tens of millions of families Dr. Arroway. Feel free to disagree but there wont be any suppressing of opinions here today.
What...
What?
How can that be?
J39 Z186...?
Dr. Cullers?
Cant we get rid of them?
I think we just hit the cosmic jackpot.
 which well also need the networks help to receive and decode
... I dont understand it.  All I can think is that maybe because the video gear wasnt accounted for in the original plans it somehow violated the integrity of the design.
Could we hear to the moon?
I used... I used to dream you were alive... and then Id wake up and lose you all over again.
Am I one... or many?
You live here.
Youve... found it.  What could I possibly have that you would want Mr. Hadden?
A sunrise and a sunset every forty five minutes.
Why dont you come back with me?
Please.  Any chance of that died the day David Drumlin was appointed head of the N.S.F.  I have been in contact with a few other SETI people weve been trying to find backing from private investors. Ive even managed to scrounge a couple of hours of telescope time here and there...
... Weve been going after some of the big multinationals but without much luck got a donation from a New York dowager... Weve even been thinking about selling Tshirts.
The V.L.A.?
Peter  if you can get him to do that for me hed obviously do the same for you  we could  
You sonofabitch.
Its good to see you Ellie.
Thank God.  When we lost contact I thought  we thought... but youre okay.  Were still trying to determine the nature of the malfunction.  Did you notice anything at all that 
Peter... What is going on?  Has everyone gone completely insane?
Your faith tells you that the distance a pendulum swings from the vertical can never get bigger only smaller.
I was referring to the selectees mingling with the selectors.
Relativity.  Explain this to me one more time... even if you traveled near the speed of light when you came back 
During the crusades  pilgrims who made the journey to the holy land brought back a palm frond to show theyd actually been there.  I thought it sort of made sense that Earth is now your holy land so...
What...?
Ellie what is it?
Im assuming you read my deposition.
So.  Im assuming they sent you here to administer last rites?
But 
... but it is a good question and I suppose Ill always wonder about the answer  Why would they send me back without proof?
I dont know.  If it was a god it was searching for a greater one.  It was still searching for meaning...
Im not sure...  Maybe it simply exists in the search for it.  Maybe its something we have to make for ourselves.
I guess Id say I trust us enough to believe our response would be something to the effect of thanks for the advice but no thanks.  But to dilute or censor the truth for whatever reason 
Hot damn Drag. Tomorrows Saturday. Another week almost made.
You never thought thats a heavy load?
Yeah.
No.
Nothin to do with it. I aint never give John the kind of feelin I give you so Im payin him off now. Dont feel you got to say anything. Way it is sometimes you just have a feelin for a child or you dont and with John I just didnt.
Go hard
We saw the broads.
Luke you run again and well kill you.
He aint even got the sense to run from the road like everybody else.
Only two? Man I already done eight. Nothin to it. Just make the days and let the weeks and the years make themselves.
Borrowin or payin back?
Looka that Two of them. Oh my...
Lemme see it
Oh lookit that brunette.
Somebody say somethin?
Whatta you so happy about?
Whyd you have to say fifty? Why not thirtyfive or thirtynine?
Damn Luke. Whats the matter with you? whats the matter with me?
What did I do? Stole and tole lies. I loved mah neighbor and his wife but what did I do to deserve this lunatic to come in mah happy home and beat me outa hard earned bread.
What you talkin about Luke? Were together you and me just like always. Now the thing we gotta work out is how to get Koko outa there and then the Terrible Trio be all complete again. Man this old Free World aint gonna know which ear to stand on.
Luke. Where you goin?
Not a liar. You just have a common  and likable  tendency toward exaggeration.
All right now get mad at them eggs. Eat it there boy Bite it Gnaw on it
Man its so hot.
Cuter again.
Yeah found one in this supermarket keys in the ignition.
Pictures a phoney... Cost me a weeks pay.
Koko why dont you let one of these Newmeats take your broom for today?
He cant phone you unless the warden gets an okay from you.  Did you give him an approval?
Monsieur Andy disapproves of my coiffure?
Are you staying long?  Shall I shut the door?  Make your coffee?  Make the beds?
Who are you?
I never hurt nobody...
You dont listen very good.  This break in  I can call it a felony  three strikes and you got about sixteen strikes already and youre in jail for the rest of your life no parole.  Or I could see it gets forgotten.
No thats still in my jacket I was wearing.  We were supposed to meet on the docks that number 47 wharf 10 oclock Friday.  Hes gonna hand me 500 bucks.
Where is it?
Daryll Lee Cullum he wrote that book he wanted the lady to have it.  They wont let him send it to her so Im getting out he asks me to deliver it in person he says put it on her pillow.  It has all about how he tried to kill her.
Shes supposed to have it.
I think whatever is best for you Daryll.  And maybe youre right thats the place.
How was Conrad supposed to find Kurten?
Youve been perfect.  Dont spoil the symmetry  you have to have a male cop.
Why did you do that?  Didnt you have any idea how hard it was for me to get that far?  I worshipped you.  You inspired me.  I thought you could understand me the way you understood the others.  I knew that about you  the ones you admired were the great murderers they fascinated you.
Do you have any evidence to report maam?  Do you know any of the victims...
Ring the gong he goes.  Poor impulse control.
Why imitate a dead serial killer?
Well show that to...
Its uanybodyu connected to author ity.  They write they even knock on your door.  Theyre ufansu.  It thrills them to flirt with getting caught.
She was killed somewhere else and dumped outdoors in an empty lot. Where it says no dumping.  Her legs pulled apart in a kind of sexual pose.   Its all different but it seems so  the same. Artificial and uposedu... Somethings wrong with it.
Who turned off the Internet computer...
Helen  the killer directly contacted you.  His interest in you is uintenseu.  Im worried about you. I dont want to lose you.  I know this stirs up every monster under the bed but this is the only direct contact we have with him. The only chance we have to trap him.  So you can turn Internet back on or I do and we put somebody here on a 24 hour shift and you can kick scream and hyperventilate.
Hell get caught.  If he has a plan thatll be what trips him up...
Whats that siren?
They put  Merry uSaksu on it?
Whos the married man?
The University computer is down for maintenance but Ive been going through my own notes...
How many do you need to sleep. Really sheep?
Helen.  I saw him die.  I saw him burning on the basement stairs he never reached the top.
Are you always so bold?
He was in my apartment
Youve been very useful Doctor we appreciate all youve done and now the professional will take over...
Its none of my business anymore...
Dont put yourself down like that. I uneveru used you.  I worked my way up like a marine grunt
Answer it.
Get Mercer to run the medical dental legal bills laundry and dry cleaning receipts extermin ators mailmen grocery and drugstore deliveries handymen plumbers...
Snotty neurotic bitch...
Nada.  Lemme make the call.
You got a tape backup yeah here lemme copy it on tape...
Now listen up Ruben.  You never never never mess with somebody uinsideu the case
The woman was in shock.  She was totally out on ranks.  I stayed because I didnt want her to wake up alone in a place where shed just been under attack.  Stop that you son of a bitch  The place wasnt secure.  I was doing my goddamn job  And for the usecond timeu I slept in her living room.
Ill talk to Conrad myself.  Ill be in the jail when you wind this up...
There was no sperm.
How about I put Nikko on it?
Oh maaaaan?
Christ.  How old are you?  You sure you want to be in this line of work?
Where you going?
I didnt want the Illigals I wanted just the bastards dumping them in the harbor.  Whats keeping those bums at Immigration?  Nightmare in here...
That was Bundy.  He killed forty of them identical long hair parted in the middle alike as Barbie dolls.  ...this is hopeless.  Lets try to get time for a police spokesman to appear on college radio and TV hookups and broadcast a warning?
Detective Niccoletti?
See now youve annoyed her.  You know she doesnt like you to touch me.  Does she widdle wee fing  Wuhve you so much  Did you feed her?
The other man the dead man his wife is a doctor  Dr. Helen Remington. Shes here somewhere. As a patient of course. Maybe youll find her in the hallways tomorrow on your walk.
Its about time.
Its much worse now. You noticed that did you? The day I left the hospital I had the extraordinary feeling that all these cars were gathering for some special reason I didnt understand. There seemed to be ten times as much traffic.
Ive found that I enjoy burying myself in heavy traffic. I like to look at it. Yesterday I hired a taxi driver to drive me around for an hour. Anywhere I said.
Isnt that rather too close...?
Oh yes. I thought he was a medical photographer doing some sort of accident research. He wanted every conceivable detail about our crash.
Is this part of the act or are they really hurt?
Youre kidding.
Do you live here? With Seagrave?
He must have driven through a pool of blood. If the police stop you again they may impound the car while they have the blood analyzed. Vaughan kneels beside him and inspects the smears of blood.
Hello Letitia. Im Dr. Emlee and I have some questions to ask you...
Patient.
What kind of place is this?
Do we have to talk about this?
The medicines still bothering me. It feels like I have cotton wrapped around my brain.
I couldnt really say anything because of that fraternizing rule.
First you tell me to do what I want to then you tell me to stop.
How?
Really?
How can I help?
That settles it. Im never leaving.
Do we have to talk wedding details?
Oh Ruthie what am I going to do?
I was so sure. I really thought it would work.  We have plans Ruth.
How wonderful darling.  What does that mean for you?
Are you sure Dear?
My goodness. A wedding.      My goodness.
Mom please.
I gather hes late as usual.
Im here Sweetheart. Im here. Its going to be OK.
Yes.
Oh OK well better to choose the table cloths first anyway.
Im going to take that as an honest effort at being open minded.
No 79. Sorry this makes me nervous.
Chair cup and ball.
How do you sort itby lace and cotton?
What have you done with the ring?
Guess which hand.
For a price.
A small price.
Thanks.    Whereve you been all day?
Why in the world did you let me start talking in metaphors? Thats no way for us to break up.
You must have thought about it. Everyone does.
And wed eat SpaghettiOs in bed from the can.
John and Nurse Gates are waiting for you.
Tell me all.
Where to?
How can you not like the Top 10 List?
Not yet.
I bombed. Its either work in the office or nothing.
Thats OK. We can call and reschedule in the morning.
Youre going to miss the Top Ten.
What is it? Are you OK?
What?
Silly silly silly.
I guess we need to talk.
Like Ive told you before I dont want you taking care of me.
What are we going to do?
Maybe we could just run away to Tahiti and live on the beach.
Actually I need to review the deposition questions tonight. Maybe tomorrow?
But I thought if you dont mind you could listen and see how I come across?
Its just Ive got those parent conferences and Im supposed to set up the math program by next week. And shopping for Ruths dress and that that engagement dinner.
Sure. Why?
Are you all right?
Have you been seeing another teacher?
Its a doctor isnt it? Thats unethical. Ill have him rung up on malpractice charges so fast his head will spin.
Of all the crazy things. I understood when you dropped out of law school. And during this whole mess Ive tried to be supportive. But really Letty what can you be thinking?
Hows work going?    Are you back at school?
The Superintendent was just getting ready to leave.
Believe me I wish Id understood what was going on. Ive worked really hard to get better.
Agent Hadley.
Okay.   Okay.    I believe you.
Youre fucked Sami. You know it.   Thats why youre here.
Too many people know about my involvement in this.
Uh... excuse me but dont you need a warrant or something?
They left about a half hour ago.
Hey man you cant do that
Yes. We went to the address we were given and had to tie up the owner of the house who turns out to be some Mafia guy.
Oui.
Oui.
I thought I would accompany you to the airport to say bon voyage... and tell you that Marcel will be going with you.
Daniel. Listen Im afraid there has been a big
Why are you here?
And?
Theyre gonna be what?
Uh no 
Oh Frankie whats this I hear about your brother?
Why didnt you tell me about this?
Either you are incredibly brave or incredibly stupid. Which one is it?
Ive got to tell you Mr. Bonanno This guys an idiot. How hes lived this long is a mystery.
Weve got a lot of people looking for us. Wed just like to go home.
And for my help I would get what?
I only have your word for that.
For what?
You know what makes a good get away driver?  Being able to get away
Yeah.   We just go home.
No one has mentioned the part of the plan about us getting caught and going to prison.
We are being watched. Daniel grabs the binoculars and looks.
Bring me the scissors.
I thought they came with batteries.
That moron.
We still have to get out of here.
This is Zero.
Weve got to be careful not to use our real names while were in here.
Its not?
Howd it go? I dont know.     Daniel how would you say it went?
Whats he joking around for?    Hes been shot.
No that would have left me with nothing because all of you would be dead.
Does it really matter what I say?
Why havent you turned us in?
We had a deal before you and your friends became the new poster boys for crime.
Tell me the truth Hector... do you think well find my car?
Everything.
And the other car?
Are you forgetting who supplements your income?
Yeah. Ill come down and make a full confession later. Right now tell me what else you found?
The map said to go left.
What do we do?
No I didnt.
You know a little of this a little of that. Ive boosted cars stole radios run a few scams. Right now Im into pickpocketing.
They dont serve wine here.
This kind.
I dont know.     Maybe if we did just leave 
I knew this was a mistake I knew it last night when you asked me to go along with this. I could hear that little voice in my head saying dont do it Dont you do it Jesus why dont I ever listen to myself?
Oh man... this is bullshit    You cant trust anyone these days.
This is a car. I think this is the best American car Ive ever driven.
When we get to the next corner jump out.
Im talking about human beings communicating openly and honestly.
How about Canada?
Going somewhere?
 I want to be Elvis.
Why would they want us to rob the Mafia?
Vase with twelve Sunflowers.
No.   Its mine.
Fuck you greaseball
Mr. Zammito?
No shit?
How are we going to do that?
Holy shit.
And how do we do that?
You ever hear of jet lag?
Casandra. Old girlfriend?
Sorry.   I didnt mean to pry.
Sounds boring.
Who are you waiting for?
She seems pleasant enough.
Who are you?
Isnt it a bit too late to be out? Youve brought me the sword?
Do you think you are a real master?
They wouldnt have found me if you hadnt stolen the sword.  Like a little girl you thought stealing would be fun?  You too are responsible for that death.  Come with me.  You dont want to waste your life as the wife of some bureaucrat.  Denied your talent... As a master and disciple we will rule.
Hello.  What is your name?
In that case perhaps we could be of assistance.
Please sit.
Li Mu Bai  The famous warrior? Why would he give his sword to Sir Te?
Yes I am.  But I prefer the machete.  Certain moves however call for a sword.
Ive read all about people like you. Roaming wild beating up anyone who gets in your way
You know what I mean.  Im getting married soon but I havent lived the life I want.
Ive missed you.
Without the Green Destiny you are nothing.
Give it back
No more hitting on the head  All this trouble for a comb?
Im sorry... I guessed wrong.  I though you were a Han.
Dont send me back
Keep it safe.  Return it to me when we are together again.
Do you remember the legend of the young man?
The mountain must be so peaceful... I envy you.  My work keeps me so busy I hardly get any rest.
Why?  Youre a Wudan fighter. Training is everything.
What was it?
Join me once you have finished.  I can wait for you in Peking.
Jade Fox?  Impossible.
So I shall avenge my masters death after all.
No Id already sent them home. You can blame me for losing the sword but please trust that Ill get it back soon using my own methods.
What happened?
Save your strength.
We know who stole the missing item. If the thief returns it Im sure Sir Te will pursue the matter no further.
No mercy will be shown toward the murderer who turned up in Peking.
Its Jade Fox
Theyre gone.
This is Lis personal sword a great heros weapon  He is the only one in the world worthy of carrying it.  Its too fine a gift. I cannot accept it.
I dont know...
I beg your pardon.  Li Mu Bai and I arent cowards.
We must be careful.  Governor Yu is a court official and in charge of security.  Any disturbance will cast suspicion on him.  It might get Sir Te in trouble.
Sir Te can you find some excuse to invite Madam Yu and her daughter?
He was a runner for Top Dollar. Just muscle.
Whatever it is the answers no Eddie.  Im too busy tonight.
Dont thank me.  Your ass is already in enough trouble for this shit.
Could be.
I know Top Dollar has turned your streets into his hell.
You my friend are dead.  I saw your body.  You got buried.
You died man.  I cant believe it but here you are.  Last year you and your girlfriend 
Its done. ALBRECHT I figured as much.  Did you cap off Funboy.
Mom ?
You brought flowers.  As long as you dont forget her Elly she lives.
I remember him  Here Gabriel... here kitty... Gabriel... Is he still yours?
Shelly wouldve wanted you to have it.  This way youll think of her every time you see it...
Chili dog for breakfast... its original.
I know your friend too  the one that looks like a rock star.
A year ago.  Halloween.  A man and a woman.  In a loft.  You helped to murder them.
Holy shit... youre dead man...
Top Dollar youre the only one here still wasting good air...
You want those assholes you want Top Dollar.
I wish to possess what you have now.
Neither.
Owwwaaaa  fuck me  Look what you did to my sheets you lame piecea shit  AAAAaa  Goddd
Having fun yet?  No?  Ill give you a hint.  Remember whatshername?
Miss her?
Getting a little ambitious and extracurricular arent we?
Youll be alone.
What... the hell is that?
That thing is poisonous.
Give me a break.  That guys a wacko...
Weve got company.
Ive got him if you want him.
An unexpected pleasure.
Im Kathryn.
He told you hes failing in love with you? Ive never known him to say those words before.
You promise not to say anything?
Got a boyfriend back home?
Are you often this offensive on a first encounter?
Oh really?
Who the hell is taking the time to write letters spreading this shit about me?
Look I know this is your house and all but do you think you couid keep it down? Im trying to read.
Youve read The Fountainhead?
Romantic? He rapes her.
You need help.
Gee with an invitation like that how could a girl refuse.
This is my favorite part.  Even more treacherous and dangerous than he is charming and fascinating. He has never taken a single step or spoken a single word without some dishonorable or criminal intention. Every young girl he has successfully pursued has regretted it.
The last thing I need is you going into my room searching for this while Im away.
Hows the water?
Youre naked.
Need a lift?
And thats a bad thing?
Im sorry but Im not here to be your savior.
Ill leave this afternoon. Happy?
Im... Im alright.
Okay?
What are you reading?
No it doesnt. Im happy youre being honest with me.
Lighten up.
Oh dear are you actually laughing?
I just came to say goodbye.
Back to the city. I may take off to Europe for the rest of the summer. I just cant handle it around here.
How am I a hypocrite?
Hi.
This isnt working out for me anymore.
Why are you trying to hurt me?
But you knew this was important to me.
My mother and I used to ride a lot before she got sick.
Too bad hes in Kansas this summer.
Those are my letters
Really? Bulimic headcase.
Are you for real?
See that wasnt so bad.
Lets try it again only this time Im going to stick my tongue in your mouth. When I do that I want you to massage my tongue with yours. Thats what first base is.
What are you saying?
I want you to make me copies of his letters and bring them to me.
Who is it?
What do you mean?
Its like a secret society.
And then I can go home?
Just a kiss right?
I think thats all the time we have for today.
Nudie pictures what do you think?
Greg is that you under the covers?
Positive.
McConnell Im gonna out your ass in two seconds if you dont tell me where she is.
Its been going on for a while.  Then he called me a disgrace to our family and thats when he hit me.
Will you stay here for the night? You can leave in the morning. Thats when my parents get back and 
Sorry.
I need you to seduce our young Cecile. Introduce her to your world of decadence and debauchery.
Im not interested in the latest dating tips from Jonathan Taylor Thomas.
B.F.D. What do you plan to do? Fly to Kansas and woo little Dorothy.
You would not believe what
Whats wrong with you?
Im at your service.
I hate when things dont go my way. It makes me so horny.
Any day now.
You amaze me.
Shut up.
Morning
You dont know?  She left thirty minutes ago.
Bad time?
You didnt?
Why so nervous?
A little melodramatic dont you think.
Im very sorry about that. I apologize.
I know this sounds corny but whenever I feel temptations of peer pressure I...  turn to God and he helps me through the problem. Call me an anachronism but it works.
Dont worry its totally understandable. Most of the boys that matriculate at Oakwood are very upstanding gentleman however there are the occasional bad apples.
What about her?
Later. Listen were entertaining some guests so 
Uh huh. You beat me three times.
Did she show up?
Do you mind if I check upstairs?
Wow. I never knew she had these kind of feelings.
Hey Ronald.
Ronald Im sorry.
Oh hello.
Forgive me but it was superstition ...foolish childish wishes...that started all this.
But Edward in this kind of a wish that doesnt matter.
What song dear?
Did your wishes ever come true?
Where did you get this ring?
But where did you get it Amy?
Edward will give you your breakfast Amy.
She was very pretty.
Irena.
Gosh in my day kids arrived at birthday parties before anybody was ready for them
Oilie thats for the children to play with.
I called not only the Boyds but the Irvings.  Neither of them received invitations.
You mean you didnt. It seems to me the least you could do. You cant just jump at conclusions that way. Youre being unfair.
Youre shouting at me.
I havent had my breakfast.
Where did you get it?
Some day Im afraid were going to have to tell her about Irena.
Amy you remember the party invitations Edward gave you to mail?
Did you mail then?
Where did you mail them?
But I told you about that so long ago you couldnt have been more than three when I told you that tree was a magic mailbox.
Now look this is the last time you come to me with any such stories  Im sick of this sort of thing.
Listen darling. I want you to look once more. Take as long as you want. Look very carefully and then I want you to tell me that no ones there.
My goodness dont you open your presents until Christmas morning?
We open ours on Christmas Eve. Thats considered proper.
Ive wanted a friend.
I shall want you for always.
Not even Daddy...or Mommy?
Cant you get it darling?
Of course. And Two is the prince who kneels before her on one knee.
Thats right
light shining in her eyes Throw sea weeds into the flames and the fire turns blue
May I pet the deer?
You?
But why?
A ring that I can wish on like I wished on the candles?
Been crying? That wont please your Daddy. Youd bettor cheer yourself up.
You just wait until I finish here. Ive got to dust these ships for your Dad.
Youre going to be busy all day long Edward.
Mustnt look little miss. Mustnt look.
Ive been watching you. You couldnt see me but I could see you. It was like peeking through a slit in the curtain before the play began. You would be a very good audience. I can see that.
But I only came to give back the ring.
I like stories.
Mommy read it to ne.
Hurry hurry.
But I am Barbara. I didnt die.
Oh doesnt that prove something to you? Doesnt it?
Theres another promise you must make me. That little girl who comes here...she mustnt ever come to see you again. Promise me you wont see her.
Theres a present you havent opened yet maam.
Its dark. Wed better be getting on. The family will be waiting.
When I first heard all that talk about you going down to the school to see the teacher I got really afeard.  I thought maybe you night call off this birthday party  and me with the cake already in the oven.
But there was nothing no one in the garden.
Sorry about Frida. Shes been friends with Jen forever.
No.
Yul Brynner. Theyre all dead.
What?
I mean body temperature. Do you have a fever?
Sounds all stress related. Your teeth may feel sharper if youre grinding them at night. You dont seem hairy to me. Is that all?
Jennifer?
Translation a total geek.
I guess I have a weakness for him. Its those big brown Bambi eyes.
How about I give you a makeover? Youll feel better about yourself. Youre actually pretty youre just not bringing it out.
Cant you get contacts?
Why did Gregory ask me out? I mean hes cute  he probably just wants to pitch his screenplay idea.
Why would they exaggerate?
What the hell is the tampon test?
You might want to tape your nipples down next time. Its really distracting.
And what makes you think you killed a man?
What happened to his tooth?
How could I? Im helping you clean up Marks remains and you ask how could I cheat on George?
You say murder but you have no idea what happened. You dont remember doing it so its out of your control.
Fuck its the cops. Peter saw me now I have to let him in.
What the fuck are we going to do?
The femalecycle werewolf will only kill men and never kills someone she truly loves. See I knew you never loved Mark.
Im cleaning my stove.
But how do I know if I really love Peter? And if he really loves me?
About Benito.
Never been better. Peter spent the night. I must really love him. Hes still alive.
God I hope so. Hey can I call you later? Peters still here. Hes in the shower.
Id really feel more comfortable paying for my half of the dinner.
You dont have to pee.
Hey wait I paid three bucks for that burger. You owe me...
Wow.
How about a Man in Jeopardy story?
No.
Being a cop has such a warm effect on people.
Some decaf then? That was stupid. Obviously you said you were staying away from caffeine as a nice way of blowing me off.
Okay well. Maybe some other time. They continue walking together.
Cool. I dont get guys who wear boxers. My ex wore boxers. I never got how he could wear khakis and not have his boxers bunch up.
You sure? Its my favorite shirt mind if I check?
Uh.... hi
You had a date with Carlton?
Did I tell you I have the worst sense of humor and I make bad jokes at totally inappropriate times?
Thats it? Hell my mom chased my dad around with a knife when she had it. She made us call her a different name. Shed say Youre talking to Betty now and wed leave the house for a few days.
You cant mean that. Im sure your bark is worse than your bite.
Is that how you feel?
I did shave... Do I seem hairy? Peter laughs.
Yes sort of. I mean no not really.
You at least owe me the truth.
We can work this out. Other couples have worse problems.
Sure. Cheating lying. Whats a little werewolf a few days a month? We can move out to the country where you can feed off deer.
Im going to take a shower.
Heres a towel.
No. We left the restaurant and... and I felt sick... so... so I took a cab home. Alone.
No I have a cat.
No hes not. Hes a courier. He picks up packages from the airport.
Its for you. Frida.
Im supposed to put up with a fuckin cat Im allergic to cause your friends got PMS?
How the hell is that your business?
I was thinking about becoming a cop myself. Do you take a test or something or just sign up?
Nah I dont wanna break up with Wanda I just wanna see Carmen too.
Fridas sheets checked out fine. It was just her own blood. From her... you know.
Hey there was a lot of blood.
Madonnas in Penthouse?
He was found nearly ripped to shreds in Central Park.
This is more than fishy this chick dates a dude and he winds up dead.
Yeah okay. I still say Fridas involved. Shes the last one to see two dudes alive...
You think mafia hit?
It has to be Frida. This makes three guys ripped apart who are tied to her ass.
What are you talking about?
My girlfriends predicting another murder in the next few days.
What kind of animal?
They dont speak English...
Police.  Nobody move.
I met a friend of yours the other night doctor.  Tall fellow.  No hair.  Rather pale skin...
Please theyll kill me...
What is this place?
Yes sir.  Im sorry...  But I dont understand how it was possible.  The only window was twenty feet up a vertical wall he was cuffed...
Dammit
Dont ever sneak up on me like that Who are you?
Ive taken the liberty and had Inspector Thompsons office searched as I believe you instructed.  All clear now sir.  They found several more traps and things were filed under pretty strange categories... Poor man.

Where are we going?
Why give yourself up?
I dont know who they are.

Where do you think this goes?

A fanciful idea Mister White.
A book of delusions.  Anything else?
Water?
If you like.
Horrible...
Its a trick.
What are you hiding?
What happened to you?
Wave from the door... go down the stairs... get into the limo...
Uh Mr. Alexander?
What the hell is this?
.. Nothing.
Just dont call him Alan
Look everything can be handled.  Well just find a way to handle it.
Well start by going on television and saying that hes had a mild stroke...
Do you know how many different kinds of laws weve broken?
Everybody else is buying the minor stroke  story...
Nobodys got clean kids.
Its gonna be great.  Caring about his wife.  Spending time on her favorite issue...
I can kill a HUNDRED ordinary people.
What do you mean by that?
Im serious Dave  you could get in a lot of trouble for something like this.
I gotta tell ya Dave.  Ive been going over this a bunch of times and a lot of this stuff just doesnt add up.  Who does these books?
Well yeah.  But you gotta start making some choices.
You know  priorities.  Remember when you couldnt get your car fixed cause you wanted to get that piano?
You know on an empty road where you know its safe and nobodys around...
Well  lets say your mother was in the car and you had to get her to a hospital.  Youd do it then for sure wouldnt you?
In the car.
Now some of this may feel a bit Strange at first.  You gotta remember that even a professional Politician has Some trouble getting used to...
Presence.
Dave the budgets a very complicated thing.  Even I dont understand it sometimes.  Now occasionally we have to make some cuts and...
And its proving quite effective...
Yes its designed to bolster individual confidence in a previous domestic automotive purchase.
Yes but I wouldnt...
Mr. President may I speak frankly with you?
The Fidelity nonsense...
Oh my God...  I thought it was a legitimate deduction I swear to God. See... I need a piano for my work sometimes...
Youre not?
Really?
Huh.  You know what I always wondered the way they say you guysd take a bullet for the President.
I was waiting for that jack.
Who?

Where are you going?
He said hell pick it up in a couple of days.
In fact  Im not anything like him and... I guess I want you to know that.
Thats a secret.
You know Dave  it is Dave isnt it?  I cant keep all of this a secret.
Well I guess...
I saw you on T.V... at his funeral.
I never thought Id...
Oh yeah.  Did you take care of later on?

Youll all be killed and in a few weeks theyll be back to business as usual. That place was built to withstand nuclear attack What are you gonna do with a halfdozen guns and a few sticks of nitro?
This stuff really works? No shit?

Hello Wade.
Im wasting time.

You have no evidence.  Arrest this man.

Just great.

You sure?  I can help you.
You my partner?

You want to be a good detective?
Im just doing it by the book. Analyze then vaporize.  Crimes a science.  Everythings analyzed.
Whats this?

Jesus Sanchez... what do you think youre doin?  Thats flatfoot data. Youre not supposed to have access to that.
But he was such a good cop.
You all right?
Seats too high.
William Simpson.  I like Willy.
Papers.  Last Medcheck two weeks ago. A1.  Disease free.  Guaranteed by the State.
Golly Belle that was a good idea  we should do that every morning.
What are those people doing there? What do they want?
Who are these people?
Jabez  ?
I see why youre here  you knew that nobody was coming.
No  but I can hardly wait  Mister  tell me will there really be    a man that eats fire?
N Daniel Webster will be there.
I think Id like to begin with the fireeater 
Whats that sir?
But it didnt stop. I know it didnt stop. Granny told me it didnt.
Lans to goodness what happened to that hen? Did you use that beanshooter again?
Kin you spare a moment for me Jabez?
Say ... about the interest ...
Are you one of old Stevens customers too?
I am just thinkin  now they mightnt like the idea down in Washington.
Stevens
Now run along Daniel.
Almost seven.  No  no hes not seven yet I am sure 
Why do you fret about something that isnt there?
All right  so its buried with you
Huh?  Whats that?  Well  what about it? Who cares anyhow?
Do you deny that you called me? Ive known people in other States who went back on their word. But I didnt expect it in New Hampshire.
Yes why shouldnt it?
What does it mean here  about my soul?
No no Give it to me
Why Mr. Stone you look so worried. Can I be of any service?
.... Miser Stevens soul Mr. Stone. Yes  I am sorry for the disturbance.
Trying to break our contract again Mr. Stone?
Oh no you violated clause five of our contract and I could collect right now if I chose.
Suddenly you seem quite desperate Mr. Stone    You know Im a goodnatured man. Im always open to reason. With a little security  I might
Well now Mr. Stone did you make up your mind?
Yes  yes I am the richest man  too rich. I cant think of anything but money. Thats the trouble with me.
You win. Will you ride to the village with me Mr. Stone?
Why  good morning Squire.
Ahem  we want to have a little confidential talk with you Neighbor Stone. Dont like to take a man away from his planting  but sometimes 
Yes  siree  thats the idea. Get them all here and then say Look folks  heres Daniel Webster my guest of honor. Golly I can see their eyes pop already.
Now Squire youre not going to let me down. We still want to do a lot of business together dont we?
Thats fine. Now you can tell people all about the house but dont mention Webster.
Yes  I had to pay the vet in full. He just wouldnt have treated the horse this time. After all we cant very well do without a horse.
To save us work on the spring plowing?
Mary  what would you do with a pot o gold?
But its not very becoming to you to have your hands in the suds  when the Squire and his wife 
What happened.... Where are you taking him?
But Jabez I never said that
Mary Come back ...
Howd you know to have the calf ready Ma?
Yes  and you figgered right consarn it
Helps sometimes to say it.
Well  thats comforting  Supper.
Queer sort of weather were having  queer like everything else.
You see son? Im old and Ive lived. When a man gets his money in bad ways  when he sees the better course and takes the worse  then the devil is in his heart  and that fixes him.
Whats that you say Son?
Ma  is she? 
Hello Sheriff.
You throw mighty far Jabez  almost into the pigsty.
You know Ma why the Squire came to see Jabez?
What are you looking for Colonel?  Whats your name?
Well  she hardly ever comes here  shes not the type of woman who cares to live in the country. Yes  Im all on my own  sometimes it makes you feel a little lonely   Do you mind if I indulge?
Yes youve chatted a lot womanlike nibbling around the edge  But Mary forgive an old lawyers legal mind I dont think you ever once came to the point. And there is a point isnt there?
Your spirited efforts on behalf of your clients do you credit Mr. Webster  If you have no more arguments to adduce Ill take him along now.
And who with better right? When the first wrong was done to the first Indian I was there. When the first slaver put out for the Congo I stood on the deck. Am I not spoken of still in every church in New England? Tis true the North claims me for a Southerner and the South for a Northerner but I am neither. To tell the truth Mr. Webster though I dont like to boast of it my name is older in the country than yours.
You mean  a jury trial?
My congratulations  as between two gentlemen.
The girl was off today.  Hey I didnt expect you to sit up front.  So your lady live out here?
Closer to Japan.  Youre fast.
Cause Im a New York cop who used to be a New York kid and I got six months backlog of New York scumbags Im still trying to put behind bars. I dont just get up and move.

I know you cant stand me to say Im fat.  Like I cant stand you being a bank robber.  I guess thats what love is  huh Sonny?

Whats gotten into Gurney? Hes not faking. Paul presses forward and the fight moves quickly around the room. The smell of ozone grows stronger as the shields hit and SPARK off one another. Paul directs a parry downwards turns and leads Gurney against the table plunging at just the right moment to pin Gurney against the table top with his blade right at Gurneys neck.
Dont you trust your own eyes.
No but many consider my training valuable.
Do you know this my lady?
Paul this is the Reverend Mother Gaius Helen Mohiam. She is going to... observe you...  Please...  REVEREND MOTHER Jessica you know it must be done. I enjoin you to stand guard at the door and practice the meditation of peace.

Mr. Weiss I was thinkin about what you said about how all your movies have to make a profit.  And I realized whats the one thing that if you put in a movie itll be successful??
Eddie you must have me confused with David Selznick.  I dont make major motion pictures.  I make crap.
What if I told you you could have a star for 1000??
I thought this was gonna be a sex change film

Looks good to me.
NO thats fine
Fuck me Mr. McAllister
Tim Kobza?  Tim Kobza  Whos he? Ive never heard of him

So Tracy?
Why are you doing this?
Coming to see me.  Are you trying to. . humiliate me?

Uhhh... teeth. Teeth.
Who put you up to this?
You just woke up this morning and suddenly decided to run for president?
Paul I just want you to know that no matter how this turns out youve run a wonderful campaign. Its been fun competing with you.
Yeah.
Can I sign yours too?
Yeah.  So guess what happened.  So Mr. McAllister he   Oh hi. Lisa.
Hows the left these days?
Can I get you a drink?
Have you ever heard of Dick Stensland?
Yeah I know.  Patchetts running whores and judging by his address probably something bigger on the side.  He doesnt want any attention.
I remember you from Christmas Eve.  You have a thing for helping women dont you Officer White?
Theres blood on your shirt.  Is that an integral part of your job?
Did they deserve it today?
But you did it anyway.
I wondered when you might ring the bell again Officer White.
Come in out of the rain Bud.
Lad may I have a word with you?
Captain what do you want?
Will you work for me?
Dont look so down in the mouth Bud.  You nailed him good.
Susie I told you I didnt approve of that boyfriend.  He was too old for you.  You let him come into this house and be fresh to me.  I went out one day and old Mrs. Jensen next door saw Susans boyfriend and another man and thought she heard a ruckus.
Where are we going?
A naked guy with a gun?  You expect anyone to believe that?
Dudleys guys.
Stay smart Bud.  We build a case. We play by the rules.
Lets go see Pierce Patchett.  Run a goodcopbadcop.
We had one thing figured wrong.  I dont think Dudley workd for Patchett.
They never made a match on the shotgun serial numbers.  What if Breuning and Carlisle took them from the evidence room?  Couple of cold pieces that had been hanging around a year or two.
Shes fine.
Officer White.  How about Susan Lefferts?  You know her?
Wheres the other guy?  Buzz.
No Mr. White.  Pierce Morehouse Patchett.  Now I sense youre on your best behavior but thats all Ill give you.  If you persist Ill meet you with my attorney. Now would you like Miss Brackens address?  I doubt she knows anything but 
Officer White.  I heard you got a hardon for wife beaters.
Should I?
Bullshit.  Where would a twobit excop get 18 pounds of heroin?
Meeks is probably in Rio or someplace like that by now.
Cotton balls.  I found them just inside the meat locker door.
Exactly.  At least one of those animals had the brains to protect his ears.
Ed your observations have been astute.  Whats your assessment of this situation?
Youre twentytwo arent you Ray?
Ray we got the shotguns.
You guys were arrested this morning but none of you have last nights clothes.  uYouu were seen burning them.  Add to that the fact that you hid the car you were cruising around in last night and it doesnt look good.
And what about the merchandise Deuce was holding for me?
This is Mr. Hudgeons Wendell.
Ed I want confessions.
Its a private investigation.  I fucked something up and I want to make amends.
I shouldve known.  Whats the Chief throwing you?
Youre playing an angle college boy.  Youre getting something out of this so you dont have to hobnob with the fucking rank and file cops wholl hate your guts for snitching.  If theyre making you a detective watch out.  Some Bureau guys are gonna burn in this and youre gonna have to work with friends of theirs.
Damnit... uWhatu?
Do you make the three Negroes for the Nite Owl killings?
High line whores.  With plastic surgery to look like movie stars. And who knows what else?  Its run by this guy Pierce Patchett.  You want to talk to him?
She is Lana Turner.
Whats on the call sheet?
Decorated?
I get the idea.  You got a description?
Miss Bracken Im Lieutenant Exley.
How about White?
I want to know why you see him. Is it a Patchett payoff?
Ill take your word for it.
Does all that make it harder for you to hate him or easier?
I came out here with a dream. Thats gone but I settled for reality.
Youre tougher than Bud thinks you are.
Absolutely not.  Dudley Smith is a highly decorated member of this citys police department and I wont smear his name without 
That other policeman already checked under the house and found not a thing amiss.
My daughter was a virgin

The price rises with the temperature and right now youre smokin. But youre right you should shop around and get the best price. Ill just let you out here.
Whatd I tell you?
They can tap anything as along as its an airwave intercept. Cellulars and pagers your kid can do.  Hardline calls wed pick off the relays as they were being fed into ground cables or fired up to the SATs. Wed suck in everything. All foreign most domestic.  Domestic was my group. Druggies radicals loudmouths. Anyone we wanted.
Meade has 18 underground acres of computers. They scan ueveryu phonecall for target words like bomb or President. We redflag phone numbers or voice prints...whatever we wanted. When the computers found something it was bounced to comparative analysis.
It was 72. I figured we had enough problems without monitoring a Berkeley kids class schedule. So I sold my story to uRampartsu and split.
Empty em till theyre almost flat. And turn your head. There might be some debris flying your way.

We lost em.

Camera in the
Popup on floorboards. And

Youre playing both sides of the street. Youre going to keep the Mask and turn me in.
STOP Youre making...mistake.
Your share.

Come on what can you do with six billion you cant do with four?
Idle hands the devils workshop.
The Mask. Where is it?

Thank you.  Its in remission now thank the Lord but you never know.  And then while thats going on I end up having to have a hysterectomy.  Plus a whole mess of lumps removed from my breasts.  All benign so far but still no matter how positive you stay an operation can still take it out of you.
Are you kidding?  With how our lives are if I start subdividing files Ill be sunk.  I just kept all PGE correspondence in one place.
Well they paid for the doctors visit.
Cause of the chromium.
Seems like an awful big coincidence  your water being messed with and you being so sick.
An onsite monitoring well?  That means 
No.  Hunhuh see thats not what the doctor said.  He said ones got absolutely nothing to do with the other.
You wouldnt happen to have a little time right now would you Donna?
Its a good day.  I feel good.
The judge came up with a number.

I want a raise.  And benefits.  Including dental.
This is the only thing you found?
Hunhuh.  Absolutely not.
We can get these people.  With a little effort I really think we can nail their asses to the wall.
Youre doing the right thing Mr. Masry.
See according to this they were supposed to line the ponds so this shit couldnt seep into the ground.  But guess what 
What do you mean?
If theyve sent that little shmuck Baum again Im gonna be real pissed off.
Oh Jesus.  You wanna tell me what the problem is here or 
And if you had to guess ...
Ho  ly  shit.
But I know youre not gonna quit on me.
Whos the judge?

You think it could make you sick living in a place like this?
You are someone.

It doesnt have to be this complicated Erin.  Theres a lot of jobs out there.
Cause I can get a job.  I will.  And you can start leaving the kids with the chicken fat lady again.  Would that make you happy?
Im bored and so are the kids.
Yeah you can.  You could just quit.  People do it all the time.

Lord Vader our ships have completed their scan of the area and found nothing.  The Millennium Falcon definitely went into lightspeed. Its probably on the other side of the galaxy by now.
... Luke you must not go.
Three patrol ships are heading our way.
Barks a doleful farewell.
I dont care.  It wouldve been worth it .... for Han.
... Like were being watched.
Im looking for someone.
Im looking for a great warrior.
Mine mine.
I havent seen him.  He probably came in through the south entrance.
What is thy bidding My Master?
Hes not a Jedi hes just a boy. Obiwan could not have taught him so much that ...
What are you so grouchy about?
It sounds like its trying to get in.
Now all weve got to worry about is what attacked him.
This bucket of bolts is never going to get us past that blockade.
I know I know I see them ... LEIA See what?
You dont look angry.
Sorry Captain being held by you isnt enough to get me excited.
Theyre moving away.
What are you afraid of?
Theres something out there
Looks like some kind of Mynock.
Im still not sure what youve accomplished.
Whatd you have in mind for your next move?
A Tibanna gas mine.  Lando won it in a sabacc match or so he claims. Lando and I go way back.
He found him in a junk pile ...
Well I do trust him.  Landos an old friend.  Must have been an accident.
I was worried about you.
That ship saved my life a few times.  Its the fastest hunk of machinery in the galaxy.  Whats wrong with her?
Hows your mining operation going?
What about Leia and the Wookiee?
What about Han?
Lord Vader has set a trap for him and ...
Whats going on?
Whatd you say?
Someones falling.
The deflector shields are gone.
Closer?
The Bacta are growing well.  The scars should be gone in a day or so.  Does it still hurt?
I cant. Its too big.
Concentration.  Heh?  Concentration.
I see a city in the clouds.
I see them ... Theyre in pain ... theyre suffering.
Theyre my friends.
There is much Obiwan did not tell you.  Come The Emperor will complete your training.
Seventeen ships destroyed we dont know how many got away.
Did you call the Zoo?
The cigarette girl in New Vegas was an undercover cop. She injected you with incentive toxin. Right now its swimming in your bloodstream. Itll start to take effect in 9 hours.
Whos that?
Ooww
I tried...
Come on Cuervo. I delivered him didnt I? All Im asking for is what you promised.
Give it to me.
I think weve burned off enough fuel. We may be lighter enough to hover. Just barely.
No. The right skids broken. If I try to set it down shell crash. I have to stay in a hoverwhile you jump off.  Hey Carjack. We gotta hide the girl. Give her your dress.
Shut up Plissken.
Wait a minute what are you talkin about?
Defense against what?
By the way  who gives me the antitoxin?
Not you?
Locked.
Wheres the submarine? Its disappeared off our screens.
Got a smoke?
Its the President for Christs sake
Too many people know where youre going Snake. Thats not good. Delgado and his men were back there waiting for you.
Where are they going?
Not yet.
Later.
Good. I want you out. This is my sewer.
Say you need anything Snake? Guns? Explosives? I can get you a crate of hellfire grenades no problem  five hours.
Kind of a bad neighborhood Snake.
Could be a big one comin any minute now...
Long gone. Youll never catch up with him now Snake.
You aint doin so good Snake. You need help.  You should talk to Hershe. She hates Cuervo. They used to be partners but they split up.
Who?
This is a dead end.  You took us into a dead end
Be careful of the bald cats. They live in these buildings.
What are you gonna do in Venice?
Get ready shitheads. Were comin in.
Yield. I have the advantage.
You are still the best knight in Christiandom. You gained a hundred advantages over me. It is I who must love you for through your courage and patience you taught me a bitter lesson.
Lancelot how did you fare in the North?
Hasnt Merlin mended your wound?
I want to thank you.
Excalibur Is it true?
Yes.
What?  The greatest? They blend together like the metals we mix to make a good sword.
With all your powers you are content to be ridiculed laughed at...
Me? I have lived by the oath of king and knight.
What is this place Merlin?
The Queen will be in my charge till a champion steps forward to fight on her behalf.
Why cant you be my champion?
I loved you much as King and sometimes as husband but one cannot gaze too long at the sun in the sky.
Why?
Why didnt he kill us?
You left your husbands side? You left your brothers wedding?
It is.
Its clear you are and it irks me.
When Arthur built the castle I carved out a place for myself where I could laugh or sleep and no one would bother me.
You are truly magnificent
You provoke me Merlin.
I am the cloudburst that quenches the flames.
Behold the sword of power Excalibur. Before Uther it belonged to Lud before Lud to Beowulf before Beowulf to Baldur the Good before Baldur to Thor himself and that was when the world was young and there were more than seven colors in the rainbow.  Speak the words.
I have walked my way since the beginning of time. Sometimes I give sometimes I take. It is mine to know which and when.
Now you must pay me.
Its not for you Uther hearth and home wife and child.
Cmon I can read for Christ sake.
Thats right Mike. But hes finished and came back around three ot four months ago Hes in Woodstock now.
No hes working on another book.
It must be alright. Hes still running around digging up tombs. Besides hes had experience.
Youd want to do the exorcism yourself?
Lets see whose around. In the meantime Ill call you as soon as I know.
And you got an invitation.
Strange...strange...so baffling. The deceased comes to visit stays only twenty minutes and leaves all alone a very sick girl. And speaking plainly Mrs. MacNeil as you say its not likely he would fall from a window. Besides that a fall wouldnt do to his neck what we found except maybe a chance in a thousand. My hunch? My opinion? I believe he was killed by a very powerful man point one. And the fracturing of the skull  point two  plus the various things I have mentioned would make it very probable  probable not certain  that the deceased was killed and then pushed from your daughters window. But noone was here except your daughter. So how could this be? It could be one way if someone came calling between the time Miss Spencer left and the time you returned. The servants they have visitors?
You were expecting a deliver y that day?
Oh I see.
Incidentally just a chance in a million I know but your daughter  you could possibly ask her if she saw Mr. Dennings in her room that night?
I know that. I realize. But if a certain British doctor never asked Whats this fungus? we wouldnt today have penicillin. Correct?
No. No rats.
There is nothing.
Excuse me Madame? Will there be anything else?
Morning.
A stimulant.
Well you mentioned her father... the divorce.
Lies?
She used those words?
Hey do me a favour will ya. Tell me something good.
Shes heavily sedated. Shell probably sleep through tomorrow.
Did he tell you about my party?
Didnt tell you of what she did?
On what?
Oh yeah since when?
No I couldnt I have to have church approval and frankly thats rarely given
Thanks. Look Im only against the possibility of doing your daughter more harm than good.
Like her speaking in a language that shes never known or studied.
Did you know my mother died recently?
No is Regan aware of it?
No its alright Ill take it straight.
Is she gonna die?
What kind of stuff?
Oh look at that.
Hey whered this come from?
Its not even a good picture. Looks to mature.
Well thank you very much but why on earth would I want to bring Burke on your birthday?
Course I like him I like pizzas to but Im not gonna marry one.
People get tired.
Over behind the church you know where I mean over there its a red brick wing?
I believe you.
She seemed fine.
Another one. Had your lunch?
I see. Well then lets introduce ourselves Im Damien Karras.
If youre the devil why not make the straps disappear?
You and Regan?
Did you do that?
Ydob eht ni mraw si ti Uoy ees I Tseirp a si eh Emit su evig Nirrem Nirrem
I am no one I am no one He is a priest
No.
Do you want to hear the background of the case first?
Save your servant
And also with you.
The Lord be with you.
Yeah its true. You do look like a boxer. John Garfield in Body and Soul. Exactly John Garfield anyone told you that Father?
You this director was doing a film here Burke Dennings?
Really?
Maybe somebody crazy someone with a spite against the church some unconscious rebellion perhaps.
Ah doctors ethics. If you knew you wouldnt tell huh?
Answer the question Father Paranoia.
Who?
MERRIN
I cast you out Unclean spirit...
We want to see Mrs. Karras.

Just like that huh?  Youre not even gonna give me a chance?
So?
Christ look at her. Youd think if she was gonna wear her street clothes shed have enough sense to come in the back.  Good evening Miss Diamond.  Youre late.
Come on.
If you ask me this is pretty stupid.
Well theyre aspiring to be sevens.
Right.
We are not a saloon act.  We do not take tips from dirty old men.

I tried Cheerios this morning. He didnt even get up. Maybe they took out the wrong teeth.
So. How are you?
Hows that dog of yours?  What was his name?
Waxy Wright.  Didnt Jon Archer bust you for poisoning five members of the Canadian parliament?
Dont they ever let us take these boots off?
I dont care  hes manipulating it.  That bomb has been built and its out there somewhere.
Where am I?
You shouldnt have brought me here ... its dangerous.
Yes ... someone might want to tear him apart  snuff him out  for revenge.
So?
Well you tried.  You failed miserably but you tried.
Im late for surgery.
... I was dreaming ...
Okay youre having an emotional crisis.  You need to seek the help of a trained 
I know you  youre the one who called.  Youre Castor Troy.  You killed my son 
I dont know that.  Maybe Jons already dead.
I know Lazarro  the first person shed call is me. We cant take the chance of tipping Castor off.
How is he?
I started wondering  if you couldnt switch back  would it make a difference?
Which ear was it?
One of my informants spotted him  right here in the city.
Im not hiding in my work if thats what youre saying.
What  what are you doing?
SFPD?  Castor isnt stupid enough to come back to the city.
Clarissa left those here.
Get a higher arc on the ball Jamie.  And for Chrissake square your shoulders to the basket.
Backing you up  Didnt you track Castor to the Army Street Terminal?
Dont worry nobody knows Im inside.  Check it out.  Remember that fat fuck agent who roughed us up in Thailand?  Hes being treated for bone cancer at the V.A.  Thanks to the miracle of NSA gridtechnology ...   Ooops  His radiation does just quadrupled.
We gut the organization  and rebuild it with more reliable friends.
All of them do.  Well kill twelve birds with one bomb.  And well be rich.
What about me?
Just following your example.
As much as ever.  Nothing.
What is with you tonight?
I think  youre trying to get me drunk.
So  how long will you be gone this time?
Isnt that what all this is about?  Letting Jamie go out cooking me dinner  your next assignment?
You always say that  then you leave.
Im late.  Gotta protect and serve the world yknow.
I think Jamies been seeing Karl again.
Im going to the powder room.
Remember this from our junior prom?  Boy were you ever mad for Madonna.
Her assistant?
Youre right Jack.  Sorry... Jack approaches Alan.
Mr. Mintz.
Thats right. And auto supply...
Good for you. Why shouldnt you protect whats yours.
The aliens...In the mother ship.  You look just like him.
Try not to be late because kids dont like to be the last one picked up.
I know I moved the Barcalounger into the corner.  Its throwin everybody off.  What do you think?
Look you fit the profile exactly.  Thirties house kids financial responsibilities.  You start thinking...this isnt the life I dreamt about.  Wheres the romance wheres the joie de vivre?  Suddenly every lingerie ad in the Newark Star Ledger represents a life you cant have...
Damn...
Wheres your follow through?  Wheres your stance?
She is relentless.
Cmon Evelyn Thompsons got no class.  She doesnt marry Dr. Steve the womans living in a trailer.
Look can I just borrow your car?  I promise itll be returned
Howd you know my name was Jack?
You know you seem pretty relaxed for a guy who just had a gun pulled on him.
Okay Jack.  Nice doing business with you... Cash is about to take off...
Miss me Jack?
...06...14...18...48...right there.  Four numbers...thats two hundred and thirty eight dollar...  Merry Christmas and shit...
You leave now.  Take ticket somewhere else.  Next customer in line...
Finger food...?
Evelyn right?
Whoa whoa whoa...hold it right there...
...I was the number one junior sales associate at E.F. Hutton in 1988.  Did you know that?
About four grand.  And a bottle of twenty five year old scotch from Mrs. Johnson in 9D.  Im putting it all in commercial paper like you said.
Christ...  Where the hell is the bathroom?
Jack...
Fine shes the kids dog.  Lets go wake Josh see if he wants to walk her.
Uh...that babys crying...
Hey  I was watching that
Shouldnt we grab some dinner first?  Maybe a bottle of wine...?
Thanks Jack...
This is good stuff Jack keep it coming...
How can you do that?
I pick up the kids walk the dog which by the way carries the added bonus of carting away her monstrous crap...I play with the kids take out the garbage get six hours of sleep if Im lucky and then it starts all over again...and why is it that I always have to drive everyone everywhere?  I spend practically my entire day in that slow as hell minivan listening to Raffi tapes and trying to figure out how the cup holders work...Im sick of it.
Its sad to hear your life is such a disappointment to you Jack.
The trek out to the hospital every day didnt help either...  You were great. Surviving the heart attack was one thing...
Imagine having a life where everything was easy...where you asked for things and people just brought them to you...
Good things...
I could stay here forever...
So whats the big surprise? You didnt rent this place for the weekend did you?
Annie goes to a great school.
Youre not married are you?
Mrs. Peterson.
And sleep you shall. Noblesse oblige is not dead.  Not yet anyway...Come lets get you some help.  Surely there must be a shelter somewhere in this city.
I just got a call from Terry Haight.  Bob Thomas is nervous...
...were really more of a boutique operation as you can see...
For one thing you like expensive things.
Its Christmas Eve Jack.
Thats totally see through...
Ill go for a cup of coffee
You dont know what its like out there.  Walking around like some kind of circus freak.  People staring whispering 
He uknewu about NASA.  What if he made the call to shut us down 
They crashed it into a wall.  A flight isimulatori.
I aint done arranging your flowers egghead.
How long was I out?
Are you alright?
Oh my Ggg.  What did you...do to Ben?
What did you wish for honey?
What do you want Vic?
He couldnt generate enough power for the machine to reach critical mass. Yet another mistake for Mr. Fantastic.
Hes not responsive 
This is wrong in so many ways.
You need to control yourself and uthinku before you 
And where do we think were going?
I though we went over this.
Apparently I can disappear.
Stop it.
Wait.  You mean theres chance we could be fullon247fantastic?
Uh we call my sister the invisible girl...the Invisible Girl.
Johnny?  Did you see Ben?
Theyre ready for you sir.
Leonard hows the feed?
Front page?
Funny how things turn out isnt it?
uBenu did this?
But Im not done with the machine 
I uh think I remember the number.
Material made from selfregulating unstable molecules.  Ive been working on a formula for this.
Which was?
What?
Sue.  Your clothes.  Lose them.
Im saying if you had a little more self control you could locate the trigger.  Can you remember the exact emotions when 
Okay.  Is there any way to duplicate that feeling?  Some memory or...
I mean uyouu broke up with umeu right?
There were a lot of variables to consider 
Which is why Im working utwentyu hours a day checking every variable 
Its been a good two years Victor... The companys accomplished so much.
Victor wait slow down a second.  I want you to know I appreciate everything youve done for me but I just dont 
Benes natural defenses. White Corpuscles  Antibodies. Once you begin to grow  and become a menace to the body  youll trigger them off... MICHAELS With all the unknown factors in the body I still say risking five lives for one is something we should reconsider 
Okay to proceed.
Doctor...without killing him  how long could we stop his heart?
I know that. But whats the maximum?
Cardiac Red Alert were stopping the Heart.
Times up... Well have to take them out immediately.
Benes... What the devil happened?
Cora Peterson his Technical Assistant. Youll join Duval and the others 
Theyre bound to try again. No wonder they want me to stand by during the operation.
Wait a minute They cant shrink me
Listen...the Heart.
I cant imagine how it possibly could have come loose. I distinctly recall fastening it with all four bolts 
Doctor...
Air bubbles... Doctor 
I understand youve been Dr. Duvals Assistant for quite some time... He mustve snatched you out of the cradle.
A long time with one man.
I never...never imagined it could be anything...like this.
Thats why youre really here. I knew it from the start.
Oh no. Plenty of cause. He wont follow the herd or change his convictions  even when theyre not popular. And he believes in an absolutely free interchange of information between scientists of different countries  and these days theres nothing more suspicious than that.
But that isnt possible.
That puts us right here... Which means we can head straight for the Sub Arachnoid Cavity.
The Soul? The finite mind cannot comprehend Infinity. And the Soul which comes from God is Infinite.
and certain chemicals involving proteins 
Dont tell me theyre refueling...
Yes...  We can transfer over to the Inner Ear and go by way of the Endolymphatic Duct.
They know they failed to kill Benes. Security thinks theyll try again first chance they get. Were afraid of medical sabotage  or surgical assassination.
Miss Peterson his Technical Assistant.
Sounds like heavy artillery...
At this size I would certainly think so.
All right now  push the snorkel through as soon as I get inside.
But thatll knock out our communications Well be cutting ourselves off from the outside.
Well sir? Which is it? The wireless or Benes life?
Cough? If he can kick up a storm by just breathing 
I  I dont know what to say. I know hes under a cloud but theres not a more dedicated man in the entire medical profession.
I cant believe it. Whatever happened was an accident.
Hold it Skipper.  What happens if we overstay?
Sorry we had to get you up at this hour Mr. Grant.
Thats cutting it mighty close  for a perfect fit.
Prepare for Miniaturization...
Any reserve air?
Ive come up against fanatics before and Duval just doesnt fit the pattern.  Im going out there Skipper. Maybe I can be of some help...
What happened?
We feel great dont we? Just great?
Whats wrong Skipper?
Captain how will you be able to follow my charts   from up there?
Thats it...
Ill never find my way through that.
Well that takes care of the valve. It was probably caused by that electric shock.
You uh... Im sorry sir but 
Im sorry sir we do have to charge you the four dollars.
...Is this a fucking joke?
... What is he deaf?... So uh how long have you been with the escort service?

Youre such a nutcase I cant even begin to keep up.
Where?  Here?

The Paper Street Soap Company.
Hes not here.
What kind of stupid question is that?
You mean you want to know if I think we were just having sex or making love?
Say my name.
Marla...
I dont want to hear anything youve got to say.
Theres a part of you I really like but I cant do this anymore.  I just cant.  This is killing me...
... and you come home to this.
How have you been?
I had everything in that bag.  My C.K. shirts... my D.K.N.Y. shoes...
Tonight were going to open the green door  the heart chakra...
Two equal parts gasoline and diet cola.  Three dissolve kittylitter in gasoline until the mixture is thick.
Insurancell cover it.

Thank you.
Whats that?
A nice big cock.

Alright go crazy.  Let er rip.
Shit.  Sorry.  That didnt count.

I know that.
Same here.
Wheres your car?
What are you reading?
Unbelievable huh?
Promise you wont.
Huh?
I... I think I understand.  I think I get it...
... Marla ... ?
I feel sick.
Is this a needlepoint club?  Is it about you and me?
This does not belong to us.  We are not the leaders.  We are not special.
What are you talking about?
Applicant?
And were definitely filling a void in the rural South.
You broke your promise.  You talked to her about me.
Why did you do that?
Is this really news to you?
The first rule of fight club is  you dont talk about fight club.
Oh yeah.  I didnt really know my Dad...
...stop me?
...to let this happen
What are you doing running through the streets in your underpants?  We both use that body.
I wouldnt be doing that.  Unless you know which wires in what order...
One minute.
This is the beginning.  Were at ground zero.  Maybe you should say a few words to mark the occasion.
Please...
What?
Why... why... why... ?
If I leave you will be right back where I found you...
Now wait theres been a mixup. Everythings changed...
Its what he would have wanted sir.
Would you rather be dead?
Yeah how?
Thats good.  Get all your tears out now youll need your eyes.  For the signs.
I was driving a white van.  It mustve gone out of control because it crashed into a lake and I drowned.  It was...horrible.
I can practically taste the water in my throat.  And something else.  The smell of flowers...
Are you crazy?  What makes you think youd survive?
This makes no sense.  Isabella was supposed to crash her van into a lake.  Could we have altered her destiny when we had her arrested?
What do you want me to do?
No  It cant be.
Make sure all these people will be at the meeting tonight.
Jury duty?  Thats randomly selected by social security numbers.
Um Clear?  Im sorry...about before. I...
So if you never got off the plane none of us would be alive in the first place.
I had tickets to go but one day Im in Paris trippin on acid sippin lattes an such and this dude gets whacked by a falling sign.
Freaked me out so bad I hid in a shopping cart for four hours. Course missed the show...
A Trans Am.  That shit went out with New Kids on the Block.
Dano shouldnt we stop and help your mother?
First Im stuck with Jury Duty now this nonsense.
I tried calling last night but your father 
Noras not coming.  She refuses to leave her son.
This is cheery.
For Gods sake leave him alone Dad.
This trip better be worth it. Whats the guygirl ratio again?
Whats the chance of finding a nice mature guy once we get to Daytona?
Relax you need to chill the fuck out.
The best way to get to Yankee Stadium is Route 18.
Thanks Dad.  Ill call you.
Kimberly?  Its Dad.
What on Earth are they doing?
Youre all certifiable you know that?  I cant believe Ive been listening to this crap.  Come on Tim lets go outside.
Thats why I was there last night.
Ahhh fuck You fucking asshole. You think this is funny you fucking dick? Tod if youre not dead Im gonna fucking kill you
Cant you open the door?

Where is she anyway?
You were going without saying goodbye?
What have you been doing since then?
Nothing.
Thats right. Have you anything to suggest?
Carl restored my confidence. He really did. Hes much more substantial than you give him credit for.
Thatll make you happy.
Did you hear about my misfortune Robert?
I hope you feel at home Robert.  Im really glad youre here.
Ive walked across a stage a number of times without exciting any particular response...
Havent you got a jacket or anything with you?
No I wouldnt.
Hey follow that truck. They know the best places to stop.

The choice of words squashed flat juxtaposed against the image of a fluffy kitten...
Thats exactly what I am doing again.
Alright tell me whatd you hear?
I told you no. Im not that type.
Who are you?
Yo.
Remember me from the pool?
So what you think of me?

You sure? Shes got kind of like brown hair.
So what do you want with her anyway?
How do I know youre not lying.
I know how ta get him back if you want.
I feel like dirt. They even want to know what hes doing in Utah?
I wasnt asking.
You decorate this yourself or did Mrs. Chief of Police help you?
Your editor called me yesterday to respond to allegations youre about to print about police involvement in narcotics dealing. Fletch starts to get up but Cummings plants his foot on Fletchs chest forces him back down.
You go back to that goddamn beach I swear to God Ill make you regret it.
I hate the beach. Wouldnt go there if you paid me. Besides Im way overdue on my story about offtrack betting in the Himalayas. You dont think its the mafia do you?
Thanks for coming down to see us.
Greetings everyone.
So where do you know Alan from?
Sure but the end was so sudden.
For sure?
My pleasure.
Can I get you something?
I did not break nor enter. I simply chose an advisable location to await my clients delinquent husband.
You owe Wendy nine hundred and eighteen dollars.
You should have proved that in a court of law.
I think he was sleeping with Wendy too.
Are you serious?
Damn... lost again. Sorry.
Why dont you check it out for yourself Mr. Nugent?
He doesnt read my stuff well.  Sally Ann and Alan were married four years ago and never divorced making Stanwyk a bigamist even in Utah. Stanwyk is also traveling with three million dollars in cash the result of Gail Stanwyks conversion of Boyd Aviation stock. Mrs. Stanwyk believed the money was to be used to purchase property in Utah but it wasnt a fact that can be confirmed by realtor James Swarthout of Provo.  That was stupid Alan.
And what was that?
I was already prepared to commit one murder. What makes you think I wont commit two?
Has he?
Im calling the police. Then Im leaving. You wait here for them.
Why are they after you?
Sure you did.
Where does the Chief get the drugs?
Thats Brazil.
Ill give you a thousand dollars cash just to come to my house and listen to the proposition. If you reject the proposition you keep the thousand and your mouth shut.
Alan Stanwyk.
I dont work for you yet assface. Dont talk to me like that.
I have the same problem with my help.
Do you have a passport?
Fine. After you kill me take the Jaguar. The keys will be in the glove compartment.
Will you kill me?
...Stanwyk blahblahblah with internist Doctor Joseph Dolen.
I overheard it. He thinks youre completely out of control he said he was gonna can you as soon as he got the story. If I were you Id just chuck it Fletch. Screw him. Let him eat three full pages on Sunday.
I just thought... sure.  Sally Ann Cavanaugh.
Do you happen to have a picture of Alan and his wife?
I havent seen you since the wedding Jeez you look great.
Oh Im sorry. Its a beautiful name really.
Thats a strange combination.
Okay. Im delighted to have someone to talk to and youre very cute so Im very flattered but Im also very married so you may as well forget  You are trying to hit on me arent you?
Have you gotten cuter since I last saw you?
Ive been so many places in my life and times. Ive sung a lot of songs Ive made some bad rhymes...
But were alone now and Im singing this song for you.
Heres this dog that tried to eat me. Heres my motel. Heres the car I rented...
What is this....
Excuse me sir. Are you a guest of the club?
No wonder.
I was supposed to meet Mrs. Cavanaugh.
I spoke to her last week. She didnt say anything.
Uh almost is not an answer. Yes Frank its all done thats an answer.
Oh I hate it when he calls me that.
Whats the spread on the game tonight?
I have some ideas.
He threw me in a cell took a gun and a knife and threatened to kill me right there if I didnt promise to give up the story.
I just stepped out of the shower Can you give me a minute?
Oh that  Dont take it personally. He always wakes up before I do. Down boy  Roseanne Barr naked
Some fag.  Charged me up the ass.
That was close...
You gotta shave before you leave the house in a dress like that and I dont mean your legs.  Why didnt you jump on her?  Whats happening to you?
You wish.
Gday they say its worth three grand...
Youre saying you need money.
Thats for me... Radio contests really Ford how tacky...
So what about this watch?
Quiet.  Tell me you tapped in the police computer and found out lots of good stuff about Art Mooney...
A fucking C.D.  Wow this case is closed.  So shes got bad taste in music and in men... Did I tell you she and Johnny were lovers and that they were into something and he got killed for it?
I wish I knew.  You did good work...
Hmmm the first disc was putting out an incomprehensible stream of high bits.  This one is putting out low bits.  The data is in some fucked binary system.  The two discs need to interface simultaneously with a third decryptor disc.  Comprendo?
What an interface
I just cant deal with all this crap between us Im sorry.  Im quitting.
Got those Vomit invites here...
Its red Ford.
You okay?
Uh... wha?  Youre supposed to answer those questions not ask em.  I take it a woman named Colleen Sutton is not your big sister and that the late D.J. Johnny Crunch aint your daddy?
You hung out with Bobby Vomit. Who would want him dead?
Why are you depressed?  You get in all the clubs you never pay cover...
Are you okay?
I know the feeling.  This must be hell.  Can you believe a flucking sorority... Im gonna vomit DayGlo.
Ford you were right
Im afraid so you want her?
Oh how sweet your friends got his own star.
Hoh graphic  Im going to dream of ears for a year  Ugh
Fairlane you gonna find out who killed the lead singer of Black Vomit?
This aint no social call.  One hundred bucks.  To find my father.
Holy Colonel Mustard.  Gosh you didnt mention the big clue... Kid I cant take your money.
I tried to help you...
Hey I love you too you little jerk.  Jesus guy tries to make a commitment and hes gotta eat shit.
I need someone to help me with my case load you interested?  This whole fatherson thing if youre not into it I mean its okay. You know what Im saying?
Like me.
Its booty time its booty time across the U.S.A.  Its booty time...
Its some psycho killer groupie. I got an anonymous letter that says she killed Bobby Vomit Johnny Crunch and now this society dame.
Feel my thumb?  I keep it there forty seconds more and a welt develops cutting off the oxygen to your brain.  I leave.  Twenty one minutes later youre dead. The slowest most painful minutes a person can experience.
Whats fine?
Oh.  One more thing.  This is personal.  I want you to tell me youre a big sissy.
Good to meet you Mr. Fairlane. Your mouth makes quite a reflection.  Im Julian Grendel.
Well hello Ford.
What about Don?
When I say no run for the door.
Yeah its pretty amazing how much cash you gotta give to the actual artists who create the music.  Those ingrates really take a bite.  But seriously when Pops died you got Vomit Crunch and Sutton to help finance a C.D. Cleans operation. You got greedy and they tried to get the three discs together to threaten you but...
Man Julian that accident took away more than your hearing.
You heard that Bobby Vomit O.D.d right?  Do you suspect foul play and stuff?
Hi private eye guy
Hey troops heres that rock n roll detective I told you about.
This isnt music

Throw em in the bathroom will you? How good are the warrants?
You want the red or the white?
There are four auto graveyards like this one in the other boroughs handling about a thousand vehicles a month.  Those that arent claimed are auctioned here once a month.
It was a crematorium.
What am I a shmuck?  Whats the hurry?  He could see a couple of shows and visit the top of the Empire State Building.
So whatta you want a badge?  Its your first major league game Sal. One thing I learned move calmly move cautiously.  Youll never be sorry.
Which is why your phone lines are tapped and the Feds are crawlin all over you like flies.
You okay man?

Boy is he excited about the game tomorrow.
Ill be upstairs...if you want to play.
Lucky throw fire boy.
Satch you gotta just give me...Satch is here John.  You hear me?  Satch is here.
I wanna be wrong here.  But we need to go to the precinct and talk about it.
I swear Satch.
As nuts as that sounds yes.
In the bottom of the 7th Weis is gonna hit a solo home run.  Jones and Swoboda are gonna score in the 8th.  The Mets are gonna win 53.  Go watch the game Satch.

The World Series.  You called Bufords homer.
Whatd you say your name was?
Now you listen to me.  My name is John Francis Sullivan I live at 1060 41st where Ive lived my whole life.  And I saw the first game of the 69 Series at my Uncle Butchs house with my father...
What the hell...
Whats going on?
Thats impossible.
Dad...?
How could this be happening?
We gotta be bouncing off the mother sun spot of all time.
You sound...ground up...?
1998...?  This is wrong.  Who are you? Why are you doing this?
What are you talking about?
What?
But thats tomorrow.
Dont go.  Dont go in that warehouse...
Were doing all right Dad.  Were doing good.
Its hard to explain.  Something happened today.  It was like a dream.  And when I woke up I had all these new memories. Good times.  Times we never had before.
Are you alright?
Whatta you mean...
I gotta take her away John.  Im gonna take your mother away.  He cant hurt her if I take her away.
So what should I do?  Call the police? You think theyll believe me?
What do I tell them?
Whatta we do now?
What else John.  It must be different huh?  Are people living on the moon?
Listen to me very carefully take your wallet out just touch it on the corners.
Its gonna work Dad.  Were gonna stop him.
Im here Dad.  Im here.
Wait.  Somethings wrong.  I dont...

Im sorry Sam couldnt make it.
So howd you like LION KING?
I know.  Im sorry.  Work.
Are you a good cop John?
Hell
My name is Abel.  And I am my brothers keeper.
Youre all just jealous.
So what would a weekend in the country be without sex?
Why dont we go take a swim?
Wed be all alone.  We could do anything we wanted and nobody would see.
That was the best yet.  Was it you... me... or the hammock?
Hey Deb... can you hear me?
Im gonna be sicker than all of you man.  Now I gotta spend the whole weekend totally straight...  I dont think I can make it man
Here.  Go down the cellar and check the fusebox.
I appreciate the fact that you worry about me but dont.
You know what Ive been through. Dont ever scare me like that.
I dont know.
Look what I found.  Remember these?
Goldilocks and the Three Bears?
I dont know.  I dont see you for months on end and when I do you put this wall between us.  How do I break through?
What are we gonna do?
This is no time to celebrate
Were really sorry but it wasnt our fault.
Thats it.  Pull over.  Im drivin.
Darren we better turn around.
Yeah... Were gonna scare him.
Its kinda frightening to think that a kid like that can go so far over the edge.  Jason really screwed up the poor sonofabitchs mind.
Come on you guys  The games over
Once we nail Roy thats it. Victory is ours.
How do you know?  Did you take his temperature?
I thought Jason was only a legend?
Cant you at least call the camp and make sure everythings all right?
Rick.  Keep and eye on our wacko kid.  Ill be back as soon as I can.
Yeah hi.  Listen Ive got to talk to your dad.  About Jason. Ive got a plan.  I need to buy some things first but mainly need help to...
There...Ya happy?
Why?
Okay give it back.
Whered you get this?
Well grownups think its funny to be scared.
So wheres Cort gone off to?
Now you better cool out a minute boy.  You already almost got your head blown to pieces.
No problem Rick.  Come over and meet a former resident here Tommy Jarvis.  Hes got some kinda prank going about...
Yes
I was going to call the clinic and have them collect your ass.  But I dont want you around here any longer poisoning my daughter or anyone else with your warped mind.
 But this time they bombed him and then cremated the body.
I understand.  However our audience should be aware that you only charged forty thousand dollars to catch the Idaho skin stretcher.
Mr. Duke tonight Im prepared to offer you your sum of one hundred thousand dollars payable only after you provide American Casefile with incontrovertible proof of 
Steven buggin you?
Thats very colorful chief.
Tell me
Wanna know how I did that?
How many times do you want to hear this?
Ive told you the truth.
She asked me to come over.  She said she had something to tell me.
What do you mean youve never made a prank call?
Thats disgusting.
I think its time for some recreational activity girl.
Which cabin is Rennie in Mr. McCulloch?
Wheres the radio?
Hello Charles. Has everyone checked in?
You have no right...
What are you doing??
Did you find Rennie?
Hes doing the best he can Charles.
I...I cant...
Why are you doing this to yourself?
Stephen King supposedly used it when he was in high school.
So are you having fun yet?
I seem to detect a hint of ingenuousness in your tone.  In other words level with me.
Yes...
Its okay...youre going to be okay.
I dont know...weve gone off course or something...
I think so. But we have to lower the anchors so we dont drift any further...
Well be okay. I want you to wait by the lifeboats just in case.
I used to be head of neurosurgery. Big hospital in USSR. This hospital Im not kidding.
I wrapped my sandwiches in tinfoil. I ate and drove. I had one of those big checkered cabs.
Crosstown.
Under the Manhattan Bridge.
Guys ready to order?
A lovely piece of theater. Small but important.
But didnt we know it would happen?
Its just a review.
What happened eighteen months ago?
I used to carry a gun when I drove a cab.
How do you Eknow.
What do you mean?
Had to be him.
I think youre a little confused. Nothing personal friend.
This could be it.
Apparently it didnt help. You know about Peter of course.
I used to tell myself. Talent is more erotic when its wasted. Will I see you tonight?
I never see you anymore. Where are you all day?
So at the intermission I can listen to the ball game. Do you know that mother is seeing a prominent divorce lawyer?
Shes doing like those Iranians. I divorce thee. I divorce thee. I divorce thee
And you blame me. Its because we never talk. Lets talk.
You have to tell me what you thought of the play.
See Daddy.
Ive been looking for you because I want to let you know whats been going on before you read about it in a gossip column.
And youve been extremely patient.
I went because you went. You smoked because I smoked.
Alma Wetzel.
This could be it
Across Ninth Avenue. Dodgies. Where youve been getting your hair cut for fifty years. Where Uncle Billy and Uncle Marty got their hair cut. Where Jim Rorty shot a man for cheating at poker.
We must have been heroic.
I do know the answer to that. Why dont we watch the ball game later? Well go to Mannions.
Of course theyre gonna lose. Well watch them lose. What good is heartbreak if we dont experience it firsthand?
Hey Pop. I know you dont like the commotion of opening night. But I especially want you to see this play. Its new territory for me. And for you too. I have to know what you think.
Lets not start that again.
Wheres your elastic brace?
You didnt think it was okay when you lived here. You wanted to get out so fast I thought you were running a marathon.
What do you want me to do?
Some little kid stole the hubcaps.
A grandmother. God bless you.
Youre a family man Frankie?
An how many years does it take a person to make his family safe and secure and happy and then in one dumb moment what does he do?
Your problem is you take the easy way out. Losing is easy.
Say it and youll believe it. Life is good. Say it.
Theyre my team.
And youre not saying that because of the gun in my hand?
aybe we ought to postpone the opening.
What do you mean?
And he has finer moments now and then.
Im trying to prolong our afternoon. In case you havent noticed.
Yes. Ive seen your victims. One past and one future. I thought I might convince you to reconsider.
Just like proper English gentlemen. Im proud of them.
Here you see? Even the South African papers apologize  a monstrous attack.
Take a sixth step that we may follow our vows in life.
...what shape it will take. Jinnah has  what?
You really are going to Pakistan then?  You are a stubborn man.
Youre a clergyman.
If I want to be one with them I have to live like them.
Ill take your luggage back baas.
We only make wild speeches or perform even wilder acts of terrorism. Weve bred an army of anarchists but not one single group that can really fight the British anywhere.
Maybe Im wrong... maybe were not ready yet. In South Africa the numbers were small...
I dont believe it  even the British cant be that stupid
They are only clinging to old dreams  and trying to split us in the old way. But the will has gone  Independence will drop like a ripe apple. The only question is when  and how.
And youve come all this way because you think something is going to happen?
We hope you intend to join us in the struggle for Home Rule Mr. Gandhi.
Who is that young man?
I must say when I first saw you as a bumbling lawyer here in Bombay I never thought Id be greeting you as a national hero.
We need your help
Theyre sparing no one I see.
I dont know who theyve left out there to do the work. There cant be one mine left open. Have they touched the women?
If we hold firm it wont be the last.
Perhaps some tea?
Im glad to hear you say that... very glad. You see if we repeal the Act under pressure  under this kind of pressure it will create a great deal of resentment. Can you understand that?
Ah  we should invite Gandhi. What the devil has happened to him anyway?
He was right. Its insane  anything would have been better.
You almost sound like you believe that.
There are a few million miles to go yet.
Some believe it is associated with creativity although theres no evidence.  Also for sports like baseball it can be an advantage.
Of course that doesnt jibe with what we found.  This was an angry killing.
The skin flake was found in Michaels Restaurant. The employees are all accounted for.
Of course.  Hes a degeneerate.  He works at Gattaca.  Why else would we find the eyelash near the washroom?  Nobody stops to take a leak during a murder.
We found his spit in the dead directors eye. Hes signed a confessionsupplied us with the suit he wore on the night.  What more do you want?
Surely you know what you have.
We believe we have a suspect.
Would you care to lookin the telescope?
Right now iyouri presence is creating more of a threat.  I dont think you have any concept of what we do herehow meticulous our preparations must be.  We are about to send twelve people through 140 million miles of blackness to rendezvous with an object the size of a house and the color of coal.  So its rather critical to point them in the right direction. And we certainly dont need you looking over our shoulders.  Besides I dont believe there is any evidence that the killer iisi amongst us.  I dont see too many other dead bodies littering the place.
Suit yourself.
You dont understand theyll make the connection theyll hoover again.  We should cut our losses.
Again?
Everybody goes there.
I have your samples ready.
Anything Ive forgotten?
I understand.  Thats already been taken care of.  Now you appreciate I can only work with the raw material I have at my disposal but for a little extra...I could also attempt to insert sequences associated with enhanced mathematical or musical ability.
Vincent...Vincent...
No problem.  Before he dropped out he was an honor student the right majors
Yeah.
These new personality corrections Ive been reading about.
So we dont know for sure about you either.
So you didnt do it after all.
What happened?
You hypocrite.  Do you think for one moment youd be doing what youre doing if it wasnt for who you areiwhati you are?  Dont you get ianyi satisfaction knowing that your children will be able to live to a ripe old age unless they do something foolish?
What is it?
Ive got enough here.
Ive read your profile.  I dont know about the father but you carry enough hereditary factors on your own.  You can have other children.
Youre back with your own people now. Got you some professionals.
What about them?
You hired Jackson and Rudy. not me.
Close... but it takes a hell of a lot more than promises to pull the kind of strings I pulled.
You okay?
Feel good?
Whats Beynon got set up?
Just like old times?
Where did you get them developed?
Half a million.
You been okay?
Thats not all of it.
You go out much?
Its just been a while.
Keep going over these. I dont want anybody getting lost.
Promise you wont laugh.
You know Ive actually gotten tired waiting sometimes... worn out waiting.
I mean it.
We are always going to be all right tomorrow. Id like to be all right a few todays.
They checked in.
Tell me about Beynons ranch.
Do you trust him?
Lets send his cut back  Just keep going.
Yeah.
He must have.
Youve got it all figured.
There may be a hunting party.
What?
You cant trust anything these days.
Okay?
I always thought jails make people hard. Not you. Youre just not tough enough to forget about Beynon. I chose you not him.
Things cant get much worse can they?
Weve got some food coming should be here any minute.
What now?
Wheres home?
One thing though... how do I explain this to my wife?
Gonna knock down a wall?
Two.
Ill hang on to these. We dont need them till we get to Gollies. Okay. Any questions?
When she gets here have that kid of yours help her with the suitcase.

Bought at the airport.
It means we should all live happily for one hundred years.  The family. If my Father were alive itd be true.
Were going to Europe next week.  I want to get passage booked on the Queen.

Then why do you come to me?
Honey  Wait a minute lets go for a drive.
Goddamn bitch.
Whats cent Anne?
Now what is this talk about joining the army?  Eh?
He is weak.
The child cannot harm you.
You tell your friends I expect them to let me wet my beak in the same manner.  Dont be afraid to tell them.  Clemenza and I know each other well he understands these things.  Let yourself be guided by him.  He has more experience in these matters.
Ten to one shot you said.  Ten to one shot in my favor and I lose.
My life wont be worth a nickel after tomorrow.
Whos that?  Pentangeli?  Frankie quotFiveAngelsquot...thought you were never coming West.
Hiya Freddie Corleone.
Oh scuse me.
Count on me thats my specialty.
How is your wife Fredo...your marriage?
Some guys from Ninth Avenue jumped Fanucci today slit his throat from ear to ear.
What did I tell you.  The one who cut him was found in an alley.  And the family of the others paid Fanucci all their savings to make him forswear his vengeance.
Thats off now.
What kind of a family is this... are we human beings?  He knows his Father killed his Uncle Carlo.  He heard Connie.
Youre going to talk to him now.
Will you tell him?
Goddamn it where were you?
She took a flight to San Francisco. We figure shes going to connect to New Hampshire her parents place.
Me too Tom?
Theres a lot I cant tell you Tom. I know thats upset you in the past and youve felt that it was because of some lack of trust or confidence.  But it is because I do trust you that Ive kept so much secret from you.  Its precisely that at this moment you are the only one that I can completely trust.  In time youll understand everything.
I dont think so.  Unless Im very wrong...theyre already dead. Killed by someone inside...very frightened that they botched it. Thats why I am going to disappear in a few minutes and leave everything to you.
I want you to reach Fredo.  I know hes scared but have one of our people reach him.  Assure him that there will be no reprisals.  Tell him that I know Roth misled him.
What is it cant you give me straight answers anymore
How did they get their hands on Pentangeli?
They wont take him not for a million not for ten million.
Hes been dying of the same heart attack for twenty years.
I want it met.
I know you do Tom.  Then I can count on you to help me do the things I have to do.  If not call Houstan and become a VicePresident. Take your family and your mistress and move them to Las Vegas.
It might show.
I got to ask questions Tom theres three million dollars cash in that pouch Mike is gone and I have no word from him.
I think I prefer to see my client privately.
Youre right.
Frankie you were always interested in politics in history.  I remember you talking about Hitler back in 43.  We were young then.
Dont worry about anything Frankie FiveAngels.
...and the tape will be running.
What the hell are you talking about?
Mr. Hagen would you kindly identify to this committee that gentleman sitting on your right hand?
Is he related to the witness?
Senator Kane.
Anthony Daddys busy.
I wont let you leave  Christ do you think Im going to let you leave.
You missed my point you are no longer an owner.
No I meant lose his family.
I still dont speak Spanish Michael.
Enjoy.
You have to be careful what you say in front of the others... they frighten easy.  Its always been that way most men frighten easy.
My concern is that the three million never arrived at Batistas numbered account in Switzerland. He thinks its because you have second thoughts about his ability to stop the rebels.
Youre a careful kid and thats good.  But look.  An international dispatch on the wire service. American journalism not propaganda. The government troops have all but eliminated the rebels.  All but their radio station.
Hiya Mr. Corleone Im Sam Roth. Welcome to the Capri my brothers upstairs.  You wanta take a rest before you see him or can I get you something anything at all?
It occurred to me the police are paid to fight and the Rebels are not.
You know my lawyer Tom Hagen. Johnny Ola.
Is it true that in the year 1950 you devised the murder of the heads of the Five Families in New York to assume and consolidate your nefarious power?
Do you have interests or control over gambling and narcotics in the state of New York.
Sure Pete Clemenza died of a heart attack but the Rosato Brothers gave it to him.
I know.
Senator Geary I speak to you as a businessman who has made a large investment in your state.  I have made that state my home plan to raise my children here.  The license fee from the Gambling Commission costs one thousand dollars why would I ever consider paying more?
On the phone?
He dont want to talk?
Forget it Im suddenly without an appetite.  Youre making big trouble Carmine.
Dont I look like Im listening?
What if I say shove it?
You want a war?
Here is the six months increase in advance.  You neednt speak to her about it shes a proud woman.  See me again in another six months. But of course youll let her keep her dog.
Your good heart in helping the poor widow has shamed me and I want to show that I too have some Christian charity.  Her rent will remain what it was.
Thanks doll.
What makes you say that?
Yeah well keep your filthy thoughts to yourself.
This looks corny.
These old movies are such a hoot. They thought they were being scary but theyre just funny.
You know what?  I think you guys are all jealous.
Hes an artist.  Anyway hes too old to think about sex.
The look on your face  Youre not marriage material.  Youre not even boyfriend material.  Youre a kid. A big fun slightly irresponsible kid.
So you dont want to fuck.  Thats what youre telling me?
Its your job lady not mine.  Im here so he can draw my picture.
Whatre you talking about?
Got a lawn this afternoon but Im free until then.
The Master is dressing.  I am to offer you a drink.  There is whiskey and there is iced tea.
I bet youve seen a lot of famous people come and go?  Movie stars?
You mean family?  All in Joplin Missouri.
Then youre as single as I am.
Sins of the flesh?  Everybody has those.
I need to talk to you about Mr. Whale.
Thanks.  Why do you do it?
Do you want to be questioned about you and Mr. Jimmy?  Please Clayton.  It will be better if I find the body alone.
I couldnt help but notice your tattoo.  That phrase?  Death Before Dishonor.  What does it mean?
Excuse me but  are you famous?
Sure everybody does.  When I was a kid Id go with my sister twice a week.  Why?  Were you an actor or something?
Frankenstein and Bride of and Son of and all the rest?
Sat for an artist.  Been sketched.
Indeed.  Id pay for the privilege of drawing your head.
What are you suggesting?  Youll charge extra if I include a hand or a bit of shoulder.
All right then.  Sure.  I could use the extra dough.
Bride of Frankenstein.
It is.  Only the poorest families ever ate it.  We kept ours in a crockery jar.
You have to excuse me Mr. Boone. Since my stroke I am often overcome with nostalgia.
No.
Its nothing to be ashamed of in the service of ones country. Thats something to be proud of.
I never thought you were.
Ah.  A philosopher.
You might not think it to look at me now but there was a time when I was at the very pinnacle of my profession.  The horror movies were behind me.  Id done Show Boat. Major success.  Great box office. Now I was to do something important.  The Road Back.  An indictment of the Great War and what it did to Germany.  It was to be my masterpiece.
I think we all want to feel weve left our mark on the world.  Yes. I wish I had done more work.
Im curious Mr. Boone.  What convinced you to come back?
Same difference Mr. Boone. Disgust fear of the unknown  all part of the great gulf that stands between us.  Am I right in assuming that youve had little experience with men of my persuasion?
No teammates in football?  No comrades in Korea?
It was foolishness to attempt this portrait.  You cannot force what will not flow.
Good afternoon Clayton.
No.  The girl.
Is that ?
By the time he was ready to ship out the fighting was over.  He missed out.
Thems the breaks right?  No war stories for this pup.
Thats from your movie right? The only monsters are here.
Its from the first World War isnt it?
Just take off the fucking mask
Wait until I tell my friends I had you naked in my arms.  Wont they be surprised?
You okay?
I did.  But Princess Margaret was a doll.  Were all equals in her eyes.  As commoners I presume.
I didnt ask George to invite you.
Thats as good a way as any to describe it.  Ive seen far worse cases.  You might even learn to enjoy these walks down memory lane.
Take the Luminal to sleep or whenever you feel an attack coming on.
Is that Boris?  Our little chum appears to be arranging a reunion.
There is iced tea Hanna?  Cucumber sandwiches?
Which ones?  I bring them all.
She is horrible.
Mr. Boone.  He is an interesting friend.
It needs a hat.  There was a widebrimmed cream fedora...
Thats my favorite line in my favorite movie of yours.  Bride of Frankenstein.
Will that be good for you Mr. Kay?
So Mr. Kay?  What do you want to know?
Twentyone.  The romantic comedies and dramas were much more to my liking.  The horror pictures were trifles.  Grand guignol for the masses.
I am not dead yet Mr. Kay.
George Cukor?  Who made A Star Is Born?  I never guessed.
Just like going swimming isnt it?
What are you doing here?

Thats a tragedy. Can I finish my story please? I began my search for meaning. I was a Catholic Jew Scientologist Sufi Buddhist. I went to a Psychologist psychiatrist herbalist nutritionist a shaman and a psychic. And they all pretty much say the same stuff.
Basically the same thing. In a very evolved esoteric way.
So you eat read it everyday?
Whats your business?
Ohhh. Youre in therapy too Marty?
Im sure youve done worthwhile things in the last ten years. Youve had experiences.
Youre fucking psycho.
Yes. Actually we just bought that little Frank Lloyd Wright on Pine Avenue... Debis a social worker and I mow down insurance claims at Aetna
He was trying to kill you right
Not the other way around...?
I was leaving.
You went to school with these people.

Is that right?
Hey Ken. How have you been?
Im an attorney. Im with Moss Brice  Fromeyer.
So if we do his job were the bad guys. If we do our job were the good guys.
Tedious. I now authorize you to throw away all personal mail.

So what happened to you?
God its great to see you.
I have to get my head back into my work.
This is Annie MacLean.
I went on the Internet and found this article about you... It says youre a Horse Whisperer that you... you help people with horse problems. And you have quite a success rate when it comes to traumatized 
Well you know however you want to put it  I got your information from the publisher of the article. I called Montana and your sisterinlaw I think gave me this number.  Im been hot on your trail you could say because I was hoping youd consider coming to New York and taking a look at my daughters horse and possibly 
Ill pay you for your fare. Ill send you to Montana first class.
I I dont mean to sound insensitive. I understand your situation. But theres nothing I can do. You just called the wrong person thats all. I hear there are a bunch of therapists in New York. Maybe you should call one of them.
Well... yes... I had a trailer. Its not like I made him run along side of the car.
I uh... ha ha... I dont think I ever met a lady quite like yourself and I appreciate all the pains youve gone through to 
Uh no. I was gonna take a look now.
I dont have a problem with that. Its up to Annie.
What?
Its a mans world Mr. Booker. Most women have to.
I thought you lived in Chicago?
Are you shy Mr. Booker?
Shit.
Thanks.
Yeah.
How long did you live here with your wife?
I wont apologize for this. And I wont hide it. Not for anybody.
Show me again.

I cant find that charm Daddy gave me from India.
Yeah?
ITS ALMOST LUNCHTIME. ARE YOU HUNGRY?
Oh. You didnt tell me.
Do you want us to turn around and go back home? Do you?
Who do you think Im doing this for? Im doing this for you
Gee this looks like a fun place.
What would they say? Ten miles to big rock. Twenty miles to bigger rock.
Did he mention it?
Mom they dont mind eating with one fork.
Well...  So you tried riding again?
Honey nobodys trying to cure you 
I was just trying to say thank you to Diane and Frank and 
STOP IT Why cant I talk to you
WHAT? How can you   Im sorry if my friendship with Tom bothers you so much but I happen to value having someone to talk to especially when my own daughter ignores me night and day because no matter what I say its wrong and no matter what I do its wrong... Im sorry Im such a disappointment to you.
Whos going to want me now?
Whats the matter honey? Gonna miss Pilgrim?
Oh I miss you. You look beautiful.
Hows everything?
Its me.
So what uh what train are you taking?
Okay. Well see you later then.

Aw... thats so sweet.
How was the dinner?
Did you get a hold of that horse guy?
What did he say?
NO What are you  youre serious about this?
And you think its best if I dont come.
Well then... maybe I will take some time... come visit.
Small bed. Maybe I should sleep in the barn.
How are you feeling about work?
Was the trip okay?
I have so much to tell you.
Theres coffee inside... I was just bringing this to Tom.
Mrs. MacLean  why dont you and daughter stay for dinner?
Mmmm. I never knew him. He died before Frank and I met. This heres...  Frank and Toms mother and father... theres little Frank and Tom...
Thank you. Youre all doing too much.
But uh Egypt is well its like nothing else. Its like going back in time.  I remember as a kid trying to imagine what a kid my age centuries ago walking over that same ground was wondering about or if they had the same problems as me... and I felt connected to... to time itself almost. Ha I never realized how hard it was to describe.
Did you always know this was the life you wanted?
Sounds like something Tom would say.
Its just one night. If I get uncomfortable Ill go over to Hanks.
Wait uh I I dont understand. Start again  Hes alive...
 See what you can do for him ...
He says if you do it soon as theyre born it makes them real easy to handle later on.
Well Id like to welcome Annie and Grace to their first branding...
Isnt it like obvious?
Where did you get Pilgrim from?
Sure?
Grace I need you to come with me.
Hes not hurt. Hes okay. Look at him.
Its warmer than I thought.

I thought theyd all go Its him Its him and hug the guy or something.
Hes not usupposedu to be an actor thats the whole point.  Hes a urealu ulifeu uherou all he has to do is uactu like a real life hero.  Thats the ubeautyu of the uconceptu the whole ufreshnessu of it.  Did she call him back?
No dead body.  Too bad.  Not too often you guys get pictures of a body even before the cops get there. Exclusive
You didnt... get it on with him?
Reporters dont have hormones?
Look at that.  You cant buy better protection than that.  That there is your Mans Best Friend.
So uNeilu.  Hows it goin?
Give it here Bernard.
Where are these toys of yours?
All right then.  Thats important isnt it?   For you to be in an up environment.  Im saying you should literally take that as your ubaseu do you know what I mean? Its something positive that youve accomplished  even if you were forced by circumstance  something for you to build upon.
Im happy that youre working again.  As long as it comes naturally thats terrific. Youve always liked working with your hands havent you?
Yeah things are moving along but shes still involved with this other guy and its a little tricky.
Thats terrific.  Dont be afraid to be demonstrative.  Youre sounding a lot more confident than when we last spoke.
As long as you keep remembering why.
And please dont for Gods sake misinterpret that as being the voice of discouragement in any way 
Ive cultivated her interests so that now we have even more in common than ever.
Well can I make an appointment?
Do you do washing machines too?
So youre just kind of a roving 
Do you have a family?
You must value your independence.
I was thinking about our conversation the other day  what you said about choices.
I found a cent
Well thats what happens with grownups too.
Daddys gone where Rudolf went and isnt coming back
Hi. Im Mr. Edgar  Look Mommy it doesnt even hurt him.
Youve done a really great job with the house.  Its great
Have you just plain asked him?
Cmon kids lets go.
Why cant you just drive me to my old school every morning?
Thank God.
Whew.
Honey 
This  is  the  one  for  us.
I know its at the high end of our range 
Were going to think about it.
How long does it have to be a new house?
I get to the restaurant and hes not there. I waited for forty five minutes.  When I called his office his secretary said they thought I had cancelled.  I had cancelled  Then I get back to my office and uAransonu is waiting for me and he knows ueverythingu.
Honey  I cant find those large size Hefty trash bags
Oh God.
Just reduced.
Its fun.
Are we gonna buy this house?
Well get cable when the cable company is good and ready  you think you can survive till then?
Neil do you mind?
Yknow what?  Im ready to cancel our trip.  I really am. Ive had it.
A umanu started the fire.
Do you see a man?
Really?
My name is Jennifer Hillman.  Im an archaeologist.  I read in the paper about the murder yesterday and I thought I should come talk to you.
What do you think?
Tough.
He had to come from somewhere.
I asked the State Department to check with our Embassies and Interpol to see if there were any similar occurrences like the bank.  Two weeks ago in London Charles Redder from the Bronx was mugged in Hyde Park.
I brought you here to talk about him. Do you know him?
Do you not hear the wind in the trees?  The songs of the birds.  The horses breath?  There is a whole world around you. Alive.  Living.  Feel it  become part of it.  Live your life Highlander.  Its going to be a long one.
England.  There is nothing for me here anymore.
Youve been seeing her for over a month now.  Have you learned nothing from the past?
Then take me with you.
Electro magnetic soundings indicate weve only got a few inches of rock left before we reach the main chamber.
I dont think so  but then maybe youve can guess how a guy with a sword could rob the First national Bank this afternoon  and get shot six times in the chest by the guard and still get up and walk out?
Bullet proof vests dont bleed.
Why do I feel that you know whats going on?
You are a very persistent woman Miss Hillman.
Im just trying to place you.
Youre not an easy person to get to know.
How come you wanted to meet tonight?
That makes you uncomfortable?
Just a little.  Who knows what were going to find in there.  It could be a huge excavation.  A little friendly PR never hurt.
Incredible.  The cloth  the buttons  it looks to be mid sixteen hundreds.  Its a remarkable duplication.
You stayed here again last night?
Im having some people over tonight for dinner  Id like you come.
Highlander  I had hoped it would be you.
Aye  I know Las  and I have never loved anyone more.
I heard voices downstairs.  Is everything alright?
Talley.
Dead endits a clone.  What about the Mustang?
Who sent you?
Mars watch the cops  Kevin  Watch the back of the house
Cmon Dennis this is stupid.  I thought we were gonna go to the movies.
Someone should stay with Mr. Smith.  What if he wakes up?
The only way he can keep the cash is if nobody knows about it.  Hes gotta cap all three of us before they even read our rights.  Hes probably planning it right now.
Then we might as well die rich.
You with the cops?
Fuck you.  Im running this shit.  You talk to me.
All three subjects are confirmed inside. Call off the housetohouse.  Okay Dennis I want to explain your situation 
Youve been in there a long time. Whatre you waiting for?
My father needs a doctor.  uPleaseu.
You got something to say?
L.A. County Sheriffs are inbound from a bank robbery in Pico Rivera.
uI dont knowu.  Talley talked those punks into letting Smith out.  Hes fucking us over Glen.  That guy is fucking us over.
What do you want?
Theyre close.  Let me make a call.  You can see theyre okay.
Can we talk some more when you get here?
The Sheriffs will take over when they get here.
Why dont you guys grab some dinner at the Thai place?  Ill meet you there as soon as I can.
We cant carry him.
What do you want?
Kevin left without you.
Smith  Wake up
What are you talking about shot?  What happened?
Where are they?
Whats wrong with the radio?
He says that his fathers hurt.
Im not stupid  You cant get out of here fast enough then you take back command you agree to wait on Smith then you risk everything in a stupid stunt to get him out 
Were out two minutes me and Dreyer.
Okay heres mine.  My name is Special Agent Jones.

Have you requested reenforcements?
Excuse me Colonel.

The American assured the colonel that they would watch everything.
Satellites.
If I were to spare a few policemen where would I station them?
Please General I will give you money whiskey.
You have cockroaches dancing on tables and you tell me the cellar is empty? Did they drink my whiskey?

The commander is not here.

Everyone is dead there. The dogs eat the bodies in the street. I have to go.
This time the Militia will kill us.
Good evening Odette who is sick this time?
They do not have your connections.

Has Roger spoken yet?
My sister is dead Paul. They would not leave the children.

Oh for chrissake 
More the merrier.
Melissa
Oh really who?
Nice touch Pritchett subtle.
I wanna know first to what do I owe this honor? I mean I never even heard of this guy.
Less the place really is haunted.
Whats in there?
New wrinkle on an old theory for treating schizophrenia. 19th Century I think what would drive a sane man mad should make a madman sane. The Vannacutt version was bombard the patient with aural and visual stimuli far more frightening than any hallucination they could ever produce itd traumatize em back to normalcy.
Hows a goddamn building gonna send out invitations?
Hail Mary full of grace  the house is growing
Pritchett is that you?
Pritchett
Ill meet you down there.
Evelyn could you just zip it for a moment? It looks like were stuck here til morning  lets make the best of it.

Why not?
You hear somebody?
I was upstairs with Eddie 
Good point.
Price
Its okay everythings okay now.
The openings still too small well never get through
What?
...birds. Just seagulls or something walking on the glass goddammit.
Then what the hell are we doing here?
What are you talking about? You think I invited them?
I mean did she stage it all for you and then go hide  or did you just flat out kill the little bitch 
 what...are...you...going...to 
 well heres a better one youre fired.
...wow....WOW Hey Ms. Jenzen  ?
Im ready now.
I think youre gonna miss the bash of a lifetime 
I think...I may have the answer.

Vannacutt
What is it??
If youve got a gun on you Price Id hand it over now.
Ill take my chances.
Then tell me please  help me...
Please I need your help.
It works.
Wish I could take the credit but 
And you think its in there?
Pritchett what is going on?
It doesnt say.  But thats not what interests me.  Theres no death certificate for the daughter.  Anywhere.
Town records are coming up now.
It will heal.
What do these ingredients mean?
Well then who did?
Aubrey come on down and have some dinner
Hhow long will it take?
Whats he doing daddy?
I could use a little help. We have to return the van soon.
Now remember we have to call someone about that replacing that water heater.
Its just going to take a while.
To our family.
I wish I knew more about her.
What the hell is that?
Who?
Just because I have an open mind doesnt mean Im going to pay some snake oil peddler to come in and shake a voodoo stick around the house.
It just disappeared.  Literally.
You dont think I know?
Are you all right?
Youre bleeding.
What do you mean unfortunately?
Im hungry enough to eat a horse.
You must be a Londrigan.
Go ahead.  I believe right now she may hear you.
What was she afraid of?
Well you know where to reach me. The church is a stones throw away if you want to come to mass.
Where did you find this?
Do you mind if I borrow it?
What you think Im kidding?  I guarantee it.  An inch more flank.  Boys upstairs get hot.  Bingo youre an anchorwoman.
Better hurry Doc.  A real story.  With a real reporter.
Wait ... wait.  You ... you have to help me.  I dont understand.  Am I dreaming this?
Well done.  Brave girl.  Youve probably never shaken hands with a ghost before am I right?
Something bad.
Wha .... ?
Look lady  I told you  Its not my problem  I was just there
I put some decaf on.  Er ... make yourself comfortable.
How have you ... ?
Wow.  Lotta books.  You read all these?
But I dont know whats going on.
I was downtown looking for a ... a friend.  A guy I know.  Anyway there was this store.  Like real old?  Lotsa weird shit in there.  I saw this statue. Pillar.  Thing.  I knew hed love it. Youve seen the club.
Everything sold as is.  No guarantees. No returns.

My plan is just beginning.  Ill forgive you for denying me the pleasure of slaughtering my boorish employers but Im afraid the birth of the new British Empire can have no witnesses
With all due respect to that great blouse why didnt I cut out her heart?
Lucky for us the Da Vinci is located in a wing of the Kremlin that they used to throw the Miss Ukraine pageant and stuff.  Itll have the least number of guards....
Let me be the one to quote Scripture.  ....As an agent of our organization you are put in awkward situations.  Just remember Hudson Hawk is an evil evil man.
Oh the shit is going to hit the fa
For two years Ive been tracking the Mayflowers peculiar interest in three Da Vinci pieces.  Their Sforza replica was as fake as the gas leak that supposedly destroyed it.
Hey dont take your disguise so seriously.
Way to go Anna.
Hawkmeister we got you clothes great hotel and a 250000 lira per diem.
Havent you ever seen like David Niven?  You know tiptoe in tiptoe out.

Shazam we come across a diary by one of Da Vincis apprentices detailing La Machine de Oro the gold machine for those at home and the rest is about to become history.  Money isnt everything gold is.  Fuck blue chip stocks  Fuck Tbills Fuck Junk Bonds  I got the real deal  Money will always be paper but gold will always be gold
I look at you Soviet people and I feel... pity... superiority.  Most of your life your government has told you that Capitalism turns people into robots whod rather eat microwave sushi naked in the back of a Cadillac than hear the laughter of children.
For those kind of wages I could have built the factory in America Theyre Vietnamese cant we just give them more Bart Simpson shirts? I hear depressing news like this and I want to commit genocide  Alfred hold my calls.  So Hawk The Hawkster  What do you think of the vehicle?

Guess I know who wears the penis in this family.
Get away from there convict
You killed a friend.  Why should I help you go for the gold?
Except yoursyours.  The goal of world domination.  Well if you put it that way Minnie.  How can I resist?

Times gone Fort Holland was a fort...now no longer.  The Hollands are a most old family miss.  They brought the colored people to the island the colored folks and TiMisery.
If you say miss.  And the enormous boat brought the longago Fathers and the longago Mothers of us all  chained down to the deep side floor.
Id love to.
Why Betsy  we cant lose you. You mean too much to us here.
Does she suffer?
She can never be cured?
I prepared these for you last night Miss Connell.
Miss Connells testimony will be very important.
They didnt teach it at Memorial Hospital.  I had my suspicions though about the Directress of Training.
The West Indies?
But its so far away...
And that   is my chair.  And this   is Miss Connell  who is beautiful.
What in the world are you talking about?  Six ounces  ?
How do you know theres two ounces in a drink?
Betsy can I talk to you a minute?
It is not beautiful.
Have the servants made you comfortable?
A figure of St. Sebastian.
Thats hard to believe after what happened last night.
And what is so alarming about the tower Miss Connell?
You didnt find your patient so frightening in the daylight did you?
Wesley can be very entertaining.
You have helped me.  I want you to know Im sorry I brought you here. When I thought of a nurse I thought of someone hard and impersonal.
I told you.
Two things had happened Mrs. Rand. One was that your daughterinlaw had been taken ill with a fever. The other thing  completely disconnected  was that you had wished her ill because she had hurt your sons.
I dont know  I dont know
But I assure you Father Walters Miss Connell had no idea of the consequences when she went there.
What about her?
Brilliant. Hey you heading out a little early today?
Benjie
Dont be so modest Ben. Its a job that requires a certain prescience with regards to entertainment trends. You were the first to predict that Billy Jack would be a hit 
Ive been thinking Ben about Wendy. I was going to ask if shed come with me sometime to meet Dr. Woolens.
The Halfords have invited us again this year.
What do you think?
Oh yeah. Musk or something. You like it?
I... I think I am...
If youre going to insult me 
Oh lord. You think Im so dense. And now you want to be seen with your dense wife at the cocktail party. You want to wear that ridiculous shirt which doesnt go with those pants at all. You want to wear that and you want me to shake hands with your friends and make conversation and dress up in an outfit that shows a lot of cleavage and youre not going to accord me the respect of talking honestly about this... You dont really know what this feels like.
Elena.
Youll get some sleep on the couch out there?
Im fine dad.
Grades?
Huh?
Dad stop it
What you been up to?
... while children in Africa and Asia are napalmed and 
Look kiddo dont worry about it. I really dont care that much. Im just not sure hes good enough thats all.
We dont have to always go to your club dad.
 Well what am I supposed to call you?
I was actually trying to see about getting a little advice you know 
Well Elena and I have kind of been talking not really talking but 
But dad you guys truly hated each other I mean really hated each 
Oh. Elena wanted to know when we could expect you on Thanksgiving. Its just going to be you this year.
Hello you two. Am I barging in on some kind of religious study group? Elena you look marvelous. Will I see you and Ben at the Halfords?
Well I have to say I dont have much faith that my car keys are still in that bowl. Doesnt seem entirely safe leaving your car keys around?
Thanks but  oh I dont think so. Its been kind of a discouraging evening.
Jesus let me make it up to you  I can do better than that honestly 
Hi mom.
Mikey Williams?
Oh.
Im thinking of going back to school.
Im that predictable? No you dont have to answer that. Its just that with the kids almost grown 
My daughter. I havent been on a bike for years.  When was the last time you rode a bike?
 And God the angry parent and the Spirit the hope of an integrated adult self.
Selfrealization. Ministering to help people reach their fullest potential. Would you believe me if I told you I want you to see yourself reach your fullest potential and selfrealization?

My arm
She used some stupid code name.
You gave her gifts.
Dont you pull that shit with me.
Monstrous.
You dont want to answer... Two vampires from the new world come to guide us into the new era as all we love slowly rots and fades away.
What are we?
So soon? Without any of those answers you so longed for?

You want death? Is it death you want?
Who the hell are you? What are you doing in my house?
What do you want from me?
Diane
You have to ask me for this. You have to want it do you hear me?
Dont worry. He was white trash they come at two a penny. I dumped him in the swamp and untied the slave licked his wounds clean.

Dear God what have I done?
You must get into it. Its the only safe place for you when the light comes.

What have you done to me? Youve condemned me to hell.
They know about us. They see us dine on empty plates and drink from empty glasses.

I tried to tell you Louis... that night in Paris... when I first came to you... noone can refuse the dark gift Louis... not even you.
You were going to kill me? Drink my blood?
What can I do to put you at ease? Shall we begin like David Copperfield? I am born I grow up. Or shall we begin when I was born to darkness as I call it. Thats really where we should start dont you think?
The story about stakes through the heart?
You loved Yvette...
You loved your wife surely.
And did you lose her? Did she go?
Lestat escaped the fire
You havent the vaguest conception under God of what you ask

Ill go up and take a look at the General  perhaps sit with him.
Im here. The General is here. You are not alone.
There was some trouble here the villagers on the mainland this island was the focal point of their anger. They came here broke open the tombs and despoiled the graves.
Im afraid so. There were rumors people were aroused. Some feared restlessness among the dead you know the old superstitions.
Another sad task. Well bury her tomorrow.  I think wed better lock the door for tonight. It will make them less uncomfortable.
Wheres Thea?
My father  Im alone Oliver completely alone
If Mr. Albrecht is right well all be free in a few days.  I suppose youll be going on to Athens?
Has she spoken to you of her father and her mother?
I have been troubled about you. I want you to know that my room is just downstairs   You have only to cry out if you are ill  or frightened.
You will not say one single word. I know your secret.
Ive always known what an evil mind lay behind that pretty weak face of yours  but this Cathy  even I would never have believed it is of you.
Woman what are you doing here?
I have not had a happy life but that one thing   that terror which brings me awake out of deep sleep  I want to avoid it.
I dont want to be buried alive. If I die I want to be sure  quite sure.
Thats superstition. Thats something out of old tales  about the dead who live  Im talking of something else cataleptic attacks  apparent death that is not real.
What is her illness?
This girl 
Better no general than one carrying the plague.
Thats ridiculous  Theas lovely gentle 
I knew that feuds still went on but I didnt think people like you and the General would be involved.

Sure sure sure. You go on home and talk about it to your wife.
Not that it makes any difference to me but why did you come to me? Why dont you go to Sam Wainwright and ask him for the money?
Yes . . . how much is your equity in it?
Oh no George dont. Its full of romance that old place. Id like to live in it.
Oh no.
If I told you it might not come true.
All right for a minute. I still cant understand it though. You know I didnt tell anybody I was coming here.
Well I see it still smells like pine needles in here.
After that who cares?
Have fun.

The goddamn smell is always the same. 
Hi.  I closed a sale today without Len.  Thats 1200 commission if the papers go through.
That you were fired.

No one has seen a shark  no fin no bites nothing.  Be realistic.
Bullshit.
Martin it could be anything.
Get him the hell over to Amity Point the old lighthouse.  Right now.
Theres a bunch of Kids daysailing that way.  Turn them back to port.
If theyre not at the light look for them.  I dont want them out there.  Get them back to port
Mom Michael wont talk to me.

Come on
How is he?
... I have to go honey.  Phillip and I are going down together to kill the shark.
Thats right.
Its no use.  They wont come into the lagoon.
Thats a load of codswopple.  A Great White doesnt fear man.  It doesnt fear beast.  Its an orgy of food and blood.
I want that shark alive.
Lets hope he knows that.
You were quite daring in capturing him.  Very skillful indeed.
Some miss all their shots.
Philip.
Hes big as a bloody bus
We can assume hes back in the water intake passage.
A piece of pie on Sunday.
Hes a young one.
Kelly could you look after Sean for a while?  Show him around for me?
This is where to be.  High and dry.
I know  We can take the gondola ride
Yes its great
Isnt this fun

Thats it?  Good...I thought youd break out the champagne....
You look tired....
You and Sean used to make....
Im worried.. We havent had our....
You looked just like your father... The first time the shark came to Amity....
It got him....
I...I cant explain it.  Its just something I feel.
Sometimes I think Im going crazy. The nightmares....
I dont know how....
Its just like driving a car....
Youre impossible....
How do you like flying?
Our little island seems to agree with you....
Ill nick the boss plane again....
Because it wouldnt occur to you to know why.  Blushing suits you....
I dont know why I fish here...Never catch anything...Must be a sign under the water...Beware Hoagies here....
Hurry
Can you keep a secret?  Something no one else knows?
It was theirs anyway.  I 11 buy us all a drink....
When we find her well radio her position...The Coast Guard will pick her up.  Dont worry....
I want you to leave her alone.  I dont want you involving her in....
What do you deliver on all those charters you...?
Yeah....
She has good days and bad...I dont know....
Would you talk to her?  Shes got it in her head that the shark came for him.  She still blames it for my fathers death....
You moved any slower youd grow roots...Weve got a schedule...shake it man....
If you made them right it wouldnt happen...They leak....
You couldnt find your ass with both hands....
I missed you is all.  Its dull around here working alone...Smelling all that sweet cologne....
They wont fight with me....
Bad boy....
Office of Naval Research has some money....
You guys are making this into some thing that just isnt so... Its just a shark.  A great big bloody wonderful shark.  Dont say anything to anyone. The locals find out theyll panic. Theyll want to kill it.  Weve got us a great white Michael. Were going to do us some real research....
What for?  Weve got a job to finish ...Why are you making the monitor?
When I invited you...
I thought we were planning a long rosy future together.
You sure youve done this before?
How long have you known Hoagie?
How long?
I dont remember.  One day he was just here....
Shove it....
Stop that
I dont like the song.
Holy Christ....

Did you bring it with you?
Not today .. Im on a diet to day .. Ill take a diet soda ..

Where is everyone?
I havent got it.
Six girls over a period of 18 months and give or take a head or two the M.O.s exactly the same. Dark hair. No hands. All shot with a high velocity twen tytwo in the back of the head.

Let me think about that.  Want something to drink?
Okay. San Diego just came in with a lastminute scenario.  Its big.

Can I help?
I know who y6u are.  Youre Dorothy Boyd.  Youre in... wait... youre in Accounts.  You have the middle cubicle toward the back with that poster of Albert Einstein morphed onto Shaquille 0 Neals body.
Well thanks.
Oh no.  Im sure it would just make your day to drive us all the way to Manhattan Beach taking that left down to little tiny Waterloo street where you have to play chicken with oncoming traffic and your life flashes before your eyes but  hey Ive obviously had too much coffee and all  heres my sister Laurel to pick us up.  Thanks though. Bye.

But I mean really... wonderfully...  great.

Truth?
Well.
I think you should not come in or come in depending on how you feel.
No.  I have to go in.  I live here.
Oh God.
Another time okay Dorothy?
If I said that would you stay?
Why do you love me?
Its not fair to you.  This whole 
What if its true?  Great at friendship bad at intimacy. I mean come on.  Its the theme of my bachelor film 
I dont like to give up.
What about medical?
You know how much those Well Child exams cost 
Hes coming over.
He just lost his best client.  He called from the plane.  I invited the guy over.
Forgot your keys 
Im sorry I 
Alright were just getting started on my list of things you need to know. Take notes if you want to.
Good cause see I am a valuable commodity.  I go across the middle. I see the ball and a dude coming right at me wanting to kill me I tell my brain get killed catch the ball. Thats New York Steak baby.  Rare. And yet nobodys giving me LOVE. Nobodys giving me PROPS.  Nobody. I went to Arizona State Im from Arizona I break Arizona records Im a Sun Devil man
At last I find you.

Youre loving me now arent ya?
You love me now dont you?
What are you doing with me Rod?
You are not allowed to act this way.
Why are you even here man? You could have told me all this over the phone.
Thanks for coming.
Oh tell the story.
Which they do.  And were standing there. All the football guys are in the lobby watching theres even an ESPN crew.  So I turn to her and sort of grandly say Well this is me Klutz asking you Goddess of Rock Climbing to marry me. And I took out the ring and I dont much like big scenes but she said yes right there in the lobby and some of the toughest men in football wept like babies.  Were getting married in February.
You gonna get that 
Marcee

He took a shot.  Hes unconscious.

Amanda Honey Dr. Grant says its a bad idea
Her new boyfriend.
You hate to swim.

Im sorry Amanda. I am. And Im sorry for the things I said about him.
I know you liked Ben. I had no right to...
Its not safe.
We cant just stop looking. Eric and Dr. Grant are out there somewhere.
Eric its okay. Youll be right behind me.
Paul Where is he? Can you see him?
I thought we werent suppose to yell.
We need to stick to the plan. Head for the coast.
Wheres Dad?
We have to keep looking for Dad. We have to.
Let me tell you a few things about you Dad okay? Hes very very very clever very very brave and he loves you ever very much.
Hes probably has a better chance by the coast as it is. Figures that all the big dinosaurs would live in the center of the island.  Right?
Absolutely not.
Even with what I pay you you could get a better bag.
That does sound lucky.
Im so use to seeing bones. Its weird to see skin.
How would you classify it?
He used to know me.
So Marks working at the State Department now.
Weve done cranial scans and raptors actually had a quite sophisticated resonating chamber. I have a theory that their ability to vocalize is the key to their social intelligence. The way they can work together as a team.
Okay. Goodbye Ellie.
Theyll never make it. I mean they cant manage when the cable goes out.
Youre Alan Grant arent you?  I read both of your books.
We need to head for the coast.
The lady you called how do you know she can help us?
Its strikes me now I never told her that.
There is no Kirby Enterprises is there?
Amanda
But alone?  We always had great success together you and I.
Any damage?
You think Im all talk Eddie?
Why didnt you tell us about these guys Ian?
What?
No no no no no no . . .
Im not going John.
Oh 
Ian youre not insane  Im so glad
Hi Dad.
You know at the bus stop.  With the hair?
I could come with you.
I dont care about the trials I want to be with you.  I could be your research assistant like I was in Austin.
InGen.  Whats InGen?
Carnivores hunt near stream beds.  Do you want to set up base camp or an allyoucaneat people bar?
Where do you think youre going?
You rally think thisll draw the parent?
Killing lessons?  Heartwarming.
What is?
The radio rig is inside.  It runs directly from the geothermal generator so power shouldnt be a problem.
If I dont move I cant shoot it.
So you two were just uh telling old campfire stories were you?
What?
Come on
No  Were an independently funded expedition.
The kid scores with cheap sentiment.
Youve got to be kidding.
I found a way to reroute through the program.  Im turning the cars around in the rest area loop.
But would we get the phones back?
You shouldnt use my name.
Thats up to your guy on the boat.  Seven oclock tomorrow night at the east dock. Make sure he got it right.
PaleoDNA?  From what source?  Where do you get 100 million year old dinosaur blood?
Yes.  We know theyre toxic but the animals dont eat them.
There you are.  Out you come.
Fascinating animals fascinating.
Carousel.
A drought.  The lake was shrinking  
Well not one of those well yeah a possibly one at some point could be a good thing.  Whats so wrong with kids?
Oh my god they do not  They dont smell.
The what?
Anything else you old fossil?
Okay whos the jerk?
Why would they care what we think?
Ellie theyre absolutely   theyre moving in herds. They do move in herds
So what are you thinking?
Oh shit.
Oh Ellie.  Its so beautiful.  Its the most beautiful thing I ever saw.
Its just the two raptors right?  Youre sure the third ones contained?
Ellie get the gun  Try to reach the gun
They show extreme intelligence even problem solving. Especially the big one.  We bred eight originally but when she came in she took over the pride and killed all but two of the others.  That one  when she looks at you you can see shes thinking  working things out.  Shes the reason we have to feed em like this. She had them all attacking the fences when the feeders came.
Ellie com one
What about the lysine contingency?  We could put that into effect
I cant wait anymore.  Something went wrong.  Im going to go get the power back on.
Im going with you.
Come on lets go.
Its all right.
Thats right.  Will break through.
Uh   thumb  The same way.
Oh imperfections?
Alan?
Hammond hates inspections.  They slow everything down.
If two experts sign off on the island the insurance guysll back off.  I already got Ian Malcolm but they think hes too trendy.  They want Alan Grant.
Why not?
The full fifty mile of perimeter fence are in place?
Tim.
These look kind of familiar.
I threw up.
Me too.  Okay.  Well the main thing about climbing is never never look down never.
Take a bite take a bite.  Im not letting go.
Go go go jump
to Grant Shes uh   tenacious.
Whatd I touch?
Yeah they hate me.
Hey we were saving that
Well Im afraid I do.  Theres one a particular pebble in my shoe.  He represents my investors.  He says they insist on outside opinions.
That things got a what twentyfive twentyseven foot neck?
Blood temperature feels like high eighties.
Tim  Lex
Hear that?  Are you hearing this?
Tim Tim Tim....
Go away
John doesnt subscribe to Chaos particularly what it has to say about his little science project
Dont do that
Your silence intrigues me.
I think perhaps Ill just sit down.  I dont suppose you think all that much of me now do you?
I am totally unappreciated in my time.  We can run the whole park from this room with minimal staff for up to three days.  You think that kind of automation is easy? Or cheap? You know anybody who can network eight Connection Machines and debug two million lines of code for what I bid this job?  Because Id sure as hell like to see them try.
Well?
Robert   I wonder if perhaps you would be kind  good enough to take a gas jeep and bring back my grandchildren.
Whats going to happen to the goat?  Hes going to eat the goat?
Im sorry   Im sorry  
Youre gonna get electrocuted  electrified  The powers coming back
I dont think the people who live around here would like that very much...
Beautiful trees... sturdy trunks... lots of branches...  We can do some great logging up here.
Okay... well... I think its this way...
Other guy?
I seem to recall arguing the same thing in court while you were trying to file murderone charges.
Ruby come on. You witnessed a brutal triple murder and youre having trouble accepting it.  Think about what youre saying. You really expect a jury to believe that Jason has a mystery killer living in his tummy?
Its still on.
Great. Is that what youre going to say when I put you on the stand?
Thats the problem with this case. Everyone thinks they know Jasons life story. But they dont. What youre remembering is a movie. Fiction.In the movie Jasons mother runs around killing people after Jason drowns in Crystal Lake
Oh?
Fascinating.
Uhhuh...
Then Id say we should put Jason under again... run another tape on him and see what happens. Well get extra data this time. Video... infrared... the works.
This is Jasons REM pattern... and this is the boys REM pattern. Theyre identical.
So Krueger thinks Jasons dead... leaves him in the lake... but the boy actually wakes up on the shore... crawls off into the woods... where he lives the rest of his life alone.
If Im right this happened before the Krueger murders in Springwood.  That means that Jason mightve been Kruegers first victim.
You know how to use one of those?
Its only majestic from here. When you get closer you see it for what it really is.
Fine  terrible.
Preliminary investigations may already be underway.
 Ah but what if it uwasntu?
Ive read your stories.  Theyre fantastic.
Where do you get your ideas?  Only joking  Im just joking.  Lets go to a brothel then Kafka come on.
 Oh yes determination runs in the family.
Im trying to find things out myself  thats the whole point.
The cemetery is nearer the Castle than anywhere else  wasnt it part of the Castle originally?   I always assumed thered be a gate or something.  Isnt there?
You didnt give it to umeu.
Its what Im paid to do.
To do my work well I have little time for 
I did not realize it was obligatory.
 Eduard 
Im Kafka  I work upstairs in Accident 
Youre a friend of Eduard Rabans.
Whats funny?
How long were you and Eduard 
No I dont.  Im amazed that anyone is able to bear life with any assurance at all.
You almost married recently didnt you?
 I dont know the Musil district.
Ah  were back to the authorities you spoke of.
When you only see someone sitting at a desk all day its liable to create a false impression.
Burgel  I didnt leave it with him.
What seems important to these people is not determined by the amount of work it entails  youre far from understanding the authorities if you believe that.
I know how they reward failure. If they saw this Id be rotting in the quarries by the afternoon  with all the others.
When was the last time you saw Mr. Raban?
Did you go anywhere afterwards  to have a drink perhaps?
Grown men dont normally fall into the river do they?
But thats just my point  she was more than upset she was livid. She slammed every door on her way downstairs  except that one.  I was just behind her and I didnt even hear that one ushutu  not at all.
My assistants.  I should have known. Nothing is given to me.  I have to acquire everything.
 You said so yourself the firm is large and powerful.  If the discrepancy really was something big Eduards responsibility would still have to be small.  No poor young uclerku could find himself in such a fix.
... A piece of paper ...
Through a very unfortunate  and I might add extremely rare  mishap a document intended for the one department was sent to the other.  And for the first time  though your friend wasnt aware of it  two and two could have been put together to make one.
Raban  thatll be nearly at the back of the alphabet.
Its gone out so quickly?
I did read that.  They gave him a posthumous medal.
What good are records if theyre not open for public inspection?
But your goal is so hard to reach. Do you think the official network would surrender to one man?  We would never think of attempting anything remotely as difficult.
I hope it fits ... Mrs Denhams a big lady.
I thought that with your assistance we could have the premiere at the Albert Hall. Well take out a full page ad in Variety  The Lord Darrow Benefit screening. Well invite the King of England  hell well get the whole Royal Family along Itd be good for them and good for us
Get the hell out of here.
Now look at this fine example of early Hindu art ... I dont recall any sketches of this passing across my desk ...
Oh God its that bloody yank
No its not ok Were not about to be robbed blind by some twobit hustler on the make
Yeah Lifes looking pretty damn good at the moment.
But . . . we can t Jack I need time to collect artifacts ... make sketches ... gather evidential information.
Man Eater
Listen buddy Cut the crap Were looking for Ann not making a Goddamn movie
They were just tasting the berries.
Im calling a wrap. Were heading back to the ship.
Not me. Thought Id head out west ... get into some Redwood country.
Did you fear for your life?
Bree  honey  please were waiting for someone.
Why? Shes a junkie.
Mm.
 May I? Its so 
Not young he wasnt young  gray at the temples he  well actually he looked like you.
Well its more than loneliness. Hate. People hating me  and watching me and following and waiting to hurt me  you know? Im all screwed up.
 I have to close up now. Leave your name and number with his message service Mrs. Daniel and why dont you just go home and wait until he 
What was better? I made better bait?
Youre not police or FBI youre just a private investigator?
Is it the shakedown hon? You picked a loser I just dont have it.
What about the other things youve reported?    being followed on the 
 you perverted hypocrite square bastards.
Tell me about acting  what are you doing tomorrow  where do you go?
Well do you think it was him?
Did you like my friend Frankie?
Oh golly oh just what Ive always dreamed of dirty phone calls.  How come?
Is there anything more I could 
You said it was
Bree  thanks  I dont want to.
Did she and Jane McKenna know each other?
Then maybe Arlyn Page knew the Dumper too.
If Arlyn Page is living with Tom Grunemann 
How can you do it to yourself?
No.  Well all right. But you want to and I want you to and we both know it and all right.
I am scared. The things I do. The things I could do to you.
Is that all you have to say?
Oh Jesus. Oh Jesus.
Look why should it be yes or no? Cant we keep it going and see? I mean we can keep in touch and visit each other and see. People do that thats realistic.
Where how?
Im flying back out to Pennsylvania Friday Ill fill them in on things.
I read your report. I had to go along with it  the idea of this being a wild goose chase Tom being nowhere around 
Ive been up country you know my summer place my camp. I dont even have a telephone there. This morning they sent a messenger out that youd been trying to call me.
That who?
You said he was no possible connection with Tom. The Page girl told you that not Tom.
You were hired to look for Tom not someone.
What?
No. Its ridiculous. This has nothing to do with Tom Grunemann.
Well 
Its a beautiful day in Tuscarora  I dont envy you that humidity in the city.
Im sure the FBI and the Police explored that possibility.
Thank you. Goodbye John.
Im looking for a man. Tom Grunemann.  Bree thinks he may have been the dumper  that call she had two years ago. She says you sent her on it.
Not unusual.
Klute. With a K. K  L  U 
Well?
Think this is our guy?
I knew Tom never wrote that letter.
Why couldnt you ever find out anything from the girl?
Where is the child?
Does that distress you?
What does?
Thats Kim...and this ones Thelma and thats Mrs. Willewska and this is daddy and thats Batman and over there is Robin.
Greatest.
Show.
Ill tell you what kiddowhy dont I fix us some French toast?
What about my orange juice?
Mom I mean dad...
Mom I mean dad...
Im sorry.
There okay? Now thats just plain old hamburger.
Yes?
Ohhh...Ohhhh...Ohhhhh...
Wow
Wow  Thats neat.   Can I sit in it?
What did you do when you were little?
Billy sometimes when a mother and a father are divorced theres a discussion about who the child should live with the mother or the father.  Now there is a man who is very wise.  Hes called a judge.  And a judge has a lot of experience with divorces and he decides who it would be best for the child to live with.
Objection  I must ask that the counsel be prevented from harassing the witness.
Are you introducing the question of negligence here counselor?
This is an isolated incident counselor unless you can prove otherwise.
Now then Mrs. Kramer would you tell the court how long you were married?
Tell me Mrs. Kramer are you employed at the present time?
Yes...Look during the last five years we were married I had...I was getting more and more...unhappy more and more frustrated.  I needed to talk to somebody.  I needed to find out if it was me if I was going crazy or what.  But every time I turned to Tedmy exhusband he couldnt handle it.  He became very...I dont know very threatened.  I mean when ever I would bring up anything he would act like it was some kind of personal attack.  Anyway we became more and more separate ...more and more isolated from one another.  Finally I had no other choice I had to leave. And because of my exhusbands attitudehis unwillingness to deal with my feelings I had come to have almost no self esteem...  At the time I left I sincerely believed that there was something wrong with methat my son would be better off without me.  It was only when I got to California and started into therapy I began to realize I wasnt a terrible person.  And that just because I needed some creative and emotional outlet other than my child that didnt make me unfit to be a mother.
Objection your honor.  The answer is to be generous very vague.
Objection your honor  Counsel is harassing the witness.
Ted was a good worker.  But ah... ... after his wife left him and he was taking care of the kid on his own things started to change. Look I know he had problems I understand that.  Ive got problems everybodys got problems.  But Ive got a shop to run I cant let that kind of thing get in the way...  I guess I felt that Ted was letting his duties at home interfere with his responsibilities in the office.
Ummm hmmm... umm hmmm...  Well this looks very good.. Of course  ... you understand this is the worst time of the year to look for a job.
I dont recall.
I thought you might just like to know that at fivefifteen this afternoon we were officially handed the Fire and Ice account by Revlon.
My American Express...My Bloomingdales Credit Card... My check book
Ted youre not listening to me. Its over finished.
Ted all my life Id either been somebodys daughter or somebodys wife or somebody elses mother. Then all of a sudden I was a thirtytwoyearold highly neurotic woman who had just walked out on her husband and child.  I went to California because that was about as far away as I could get.  Only... I guess it wasnt far enough. So I started going to a shrink.  Ted Ive had time to think. Ive been through some changes. Ive learned a lot about myself.
Wow
Look Ted Im the oldest whore on the beat okay?  Three marriages two divorces...Youre gonna be okay.
Look its none of my business so you can tell me to butt out okay?  But if you want my advice youll send Billy away to stay with relatives for a while.  Just until you get yourself straightened out.
Ted this may sound a little rough but weve just landed the biggest account in the history of this agency right? And now its up to usthats you and me to deliver the goods.  Ted youre my main man and if I cant depend on you a hundred and ten percent twentyfour hours a day because youre worried about a kid with a runny nose
Night Jim.
What the hell is this?
Jim this is garbage.  This isnt anything like what we talked to Revlon about.  None of it. You cant
Disappointing.  It only pulled a fourteen share and they were hoping for a twentyfive minimum and...ah...theyre not very happy and...Well the guys have decided they want to...ah rethink the entire concept and...Look I dont like having to do this okay?... But...I mean what I mean is...ah Im going to have to...ah let you go
Hiya Phyllis.  These are the Revlon contracts.  I thought you ought to check them out.
Kramer Ive got to go.  Ive got an eight oclock closing tomorrow down on Centre Street.
So naturally you assume that since Joanna left that would be a compelling point against her right?
And?
Its a very good jobtoo good to pass up.  Ill be handling funding for the whole...  Look I...  ...like you a lot.  And you...  ...like me okay?  Maybe if it was a year from now maybe things would be different...
What?
Mr. OConnor called.  Theres a meeting with the Revlon people in the board room and youre fifteen minutes late.
Mr. Schmidt cant have the figures on the television buy until Monday.
Look Ted I dont honestly think she would go to the trouble of suing you for custody of the child if she was planning on kidnapping him.
Ted?  Theyve set the court date. I just heard today...Its...  January sixth.
John?
I came home tonight.  We just got the Fire and Ice account at the agency.  Do you know what that means?  Do you understand what that means?  It means that it was maybe one of the five best days in my whole life.
Boy you guys are really something yknow?  Id like to know one thing okayjust one little thing.  Did you tell Joanna she should leave me?
Yknow something Thelmayou are the typhoid Mary of divorce. I mean it.  Joanna and I never had any trouble until you and Charley split up.
Look this is nothing personal but I dont think you can do it.
Ive got enough trouble raising my own kid.  I dont need another one.  Got it?
You ever think about getting married again?
Cmon Thel.  So Charley had a little fling.  So what? All in all he was a pretty good husband.
Please go away Thel...I...I just have to be by myself for a little while...
Where are you from?
Mama my story.
Not the way to talk to people.
Where will you keep them?
You must also do something about the public meetings. I see this memorandum circulating with Tibetan grievances.
Why is it necessary for the Chinese to keep so many soldiers in Lhasa?
Plans for absorbing the Tibetan army into the Peoples Army will soon be finalized.
Then we will begin with replacing the Tibetan flag with the flag of the Motherland.
Dalai Lama.
Do you have plans to return soon Dalai Lama?
Did you receive the letter?
So we must face China and all her might alone.
Holiness?
Me. First break of day.
You did. We washed you and wrapped you in sheepskin and took you to your father. That day the father got better. And that day a pair of crows came to nest in our roof. I just remembered.
Do I have money?
You cant do anything real until you are Dalai Lama.
May I listen to the news with you Holiness?
Yes. As a free country. But our attempts have proven futile. We continue to be badly outmaneuvered by the Chinese.
Has anyone died?
I have always asked for plain information. Just the truth.
The crowd will not disperse until you give your assurance that you will not attend the Chinese festivities. Many who have been invited to dine with the Chinese do not return home.
We are now accused of aiding the rebels. The Chinese said we can expect drastic measures to be taken to crush this revolt.
Well some say. Its not for you to worry about. Another will be chosen.
Me?
This little brother was terribly sweet. When he died my mother was so sad. A lama said to her before the little brother was laid out for burial take a bit of butter and rub a spot on his skin. He will come back to you you will see. So my mother did this and a few years later a new boy was born.
What do you think?
Why is this? What is happening? Tell me
You have grown up very good.
Tell me.
Dont eat all those sweets. Youll get sick.
This is not a fight to put bread just in ones own mouth. This is a fight for Tibet.
Hmm.
Mrs. Bickerman the reason were up here... a man was fatally attacked yesterday by some animal in this lake.  Do you know how your husband died?
Maam how could you not report this?  He puts human life at risk and
Ill sue you.
Wait just a second.  You dont just fly in here and start barking orders.
Theyve been migrating north Kelly this lake connects to the ocean
I really dont mean to be discourteous.  But how is it a person could come to believe that a crocodile is in New England?
We are here on official business.
I keep telling you they ucanu come on land I dont wanna wake up in the middle of the night
I brought a pork chop maybe we could hang it around your neck for luck.
Promise you wont kill me first.
Whats that?
That usoundsu good but underneath its hurtful.  Nightcap?
I can arrest you
Gee that would really disappoint me.
Where is he?
Keep enough tension to hold him up Hector we dont know if he can swim.
She didnt tell us about the other croc cause she was afraid wed blow its head off.
Hector.  What you just did... there was at least some sort of a death wish going on.
Youre gonna be okay.
Kelly Scott.
How big do the bears get?
He could be right there and you wouldnt see him.
Hard to believe there could be a monster under such peacefulness.
Like little children.  You okay?
I couldnt believe... did you see the size of that things mouth?
Hector
You sure?  I dont mind...
If Im ever in New York...
You think?
That was... yknow if the guy asks me can she kiss now Ill be able to tell him if you can.
We set?
Im ready when you are.
Whats that?
They wont be here till at least noon.  We got a few hours to kill.
He just kinda gurgled.  He was pretty much dead.
This is a little different.
uWhatu uisu uthatu?
Youre sort of a rude person.
We dont mean to invade your privacy but... was he ill was he sick?
What?
Was that like a homosexual remark?
uWhatu?  I dont even uknowu the guy.
If he gets close you go uupu Hector dont you endanger that cow.
I had a great time last night. Again.
Kevin as long as we...  What was that last part?
Yeah that part.  Theres... somebody whos um...
uOhu...  No no Im not angry Im not Im just thrown Im...  I actually have an early lunch so...
uYouu?
You dont know what to say lucky for you action speaks louder than words.
But there is no pattern. Theres no connection at all among these places or the computers wouldve nailed it Theyre even found in random order.
 every day.
Youre all right Where is he?
What youre doing Miss Starling is coming into my hospital to conduct an interview and refusing to share information with me. For the third time
Mr. Krendler... Dr. Lecter trusts me. Or at least he used to. If I could just 
He gave us a perfectly good description and were on it now so we wont be needing your little novelty act any longer  or his either. Hes under close guard at the courthouse pending a prison transfer. The next plane Officer.
Mr. Yow if this door should fall down ha ha  or anything else  would you be kind enough to call this number? Its our Baltimore field office. They know youre here with me... Do you understand?
Mr. Yow? Oh Mr. Yow...? It looks like somebody is sitting in this car.
Im investigating the death of Fredrica Bimmel. Who are you please?
Mr. Gordon did you take over this place after Mrs. Lippman died?
Your instructors tell me youre doing well. Top quarter of the class.
Yes well... Okay right. Im glad for the chance sir but  why me?
Ive read your interim memo on Lecter. You sure youve left nothing out?
Every word Starling? Every gesture?
Well? Why arent you there right now?
The orderly heard Lecter whispering to him all afternoon and Miggs crying. They found him at bed check. Hed swallowed his own tongue... Chilton is scared stiff the family will file a civil rights lawsuit and hes trying to blame it on you. I told the little prick your conduct was flawless.  Starling...?
The other girls are in the ground. Exhumations are upsetting for the families. Ill do it if I have to but 
But for Catherine Martin it all comes down to you and Lecter. Youre the one he talks to.
What would it take?
Ohio is cold ground. Picked over ten months ago. Our people worked it so did the locals.
Hes making himself a woman suit Mr. Crawford  out of real women And he can sew this guy hes really skilled. A dressmaker or a tailor 
This Gumbs a real beauty. Slaughtered both his grandparents when he was twelve and did nine years in juvenile psychiatric. Where Starling he took vocational rehab and learned a useful trade...
And theres no way  no natural way  these couldve wound up in the bodies?
Oh sure men Pam Malavesi used to help her do alterations for old Mrs. Lippman. Lots of people worked for her she had the business from all these retail stores? But she was like totally old it was moren she could handle.
Is that a pretty good job FBI agent?
I am yes.
Now then. What did Miggs say to you?  Multiple Miggs in the next cell. He hissed at you. What did he say?
Yes. Thats the Duomo seen from the Belvedere. Do you know Florence?
Partially yes. But Doctor thats an active case Im not involved. If 
It excites him. Most serial killers keep some sort of trophies.
And the questionnaire...?
Why dont you ask me about Buffalo Bill?
Your first lie to me Clarice. How sad. Tell me  do you think Crawford wants you sexually? True hes much older but  do you think he visualizes... scenarios exchanges...? Fucking you?
Oh a very naughty boy. Someone you and Jack Crawford are most anxious to meet.
She had an insect deliberately inserted in her throat. That hasnt been made public yet. We dont know what is means.
No. He was strong he lasted almost a month. My mother  died when I was very young so my father had become  the whole world to me... After he left me I had nobody. I was ten years old.
Two months.
I thought you might want your drawings back... Just until you get your view.
No he covets. Thats his nature. And how do we begin to covet Clarice? Do we seek out things to covet? Make an effort to answer.
No. Its your turn to tell me Clarice. You dont have any more vacations to sell on Anthrax Island. Why did you run away from that ranch?
Ill listen now. After your fathers murder you were orphaned. You were ten years old. You went to live with cousins on a sheep and horse ranch in Montana. And  ?
So you ran away...
You still wake up sometimes dont you? Wake up in the dark with the lambs screaming?
Yes... I did.
Time Pilch My move.
Of course it counts. How do you play?
Better known to his friends as the Deathshead Moth...
Are you alright?
The men of the regiment will fetch water from the lake build fires and provide every comfort you desire Alice...
Though they are strangers they are at least entitled to a Christian burial
Why didnt you bury those people?
He did?
The Ottawa are gone.
The Bible. Monarchy. Many wrong ideas about the government of men. My fathers people already know each man is his own nation. And only he can have dominion over himself. Not kings. No man is better than any other man.
In this there is a chance. If I live I can try to free you. If we dont go there is no powder theres too many of them.  Though my heart would keep me here in that there is no chance. None. I can do nothing. Do you understand?
My letter...
One called Magua arrived.
Cora I adore you and when we come together we will be the happiest couple in England...  I am certain of that. More than ever before.  I believe you must trust the judgment of others who hold your welfare so close to their hearts...
They do not live their lives by your leave.  ...They hack it out of the wilderness with their own two hands burying their dead and their children along the way.
Yes. Go ahead.
... compliments Mr. Poe.  Take her and get out.
Colonel Munro sent him. He was one of our Mohawk allies.
That is the truth
And if were unlucky?
Any powder?
Folks here goin to join in that fight?
Ill cover them from the top of the casement.
So the Huron are the servants of the French?  To do what the French are shamed to do?
A man here can make a run straight through to Webb.
I didnt experience anything so surprising from Bristol to Albany as what I witnessed here today.
The Crown negotiating the terms of service?
What a place for them...
Things were done. Nobody was spared...
Not with enough certainty to outweigh British interests in this fort.
I have lived to see two things I never expected.  An Englishman afraid to support a friend. And a Frenchman too honest to profit by that advantage.
Sir
Yes.
Munro would. But General Webb will not send their soldiers across the salt lake.  Having let them go I fear I will only fight the same men again when I move south.  And yet I cannot break the terms of the capitulation and sully the lilies of France...
Colonel Munro I have known you as a gallant antagonist. I am happy to make your acquaintance as a friend.
Please accept my compliments for the strong and skillful defense of your fortress. Under the command of a lesser man it would have fallen long ago given the superior numbers and material... mere chance has allowed me to array against you...
You have already done everything which is necessary for the honor of your Prince. I will forever bear testimony that your resistance has been gallant and was continued as long as there was hope. But now I beg you to listen to the admonitions of humanity. I beg you to consider my terms for your surrender.
Such as...?
My colors?
Cest bien vous vous promenez bien matin monsieur
Are you planning on working tomorrow?
What do you want me to say? That it all sounds mysterious?
Some say thats why were basically hairless for less water resistance faster swimming speeds...
Be careful with it.
Its got Hazy
Thats why theres a dead one on the ship.  It ran out of blood.
No way...
I hit it.  But I cant see it  Can you see it?
Where the hellve you been?
Look at my foot sir  This bitch put a goddamn sea monster in my bunk
Sixpack?
No.  Im just being friendly.
Whatever made you want to do a tour down here?
They know dont they?
What are you doing?
Were on backup air.
We made it
Oh God shes out there...
Wait till you reach thirty five before you blow your suit...
How do you feel DeJesus?
I cant tell you much about it except that none of you show any symptoms.
Well according to Maritime law you as commander of the Shack have the authority to dispose of the body.  However the company doesnt want you to do that.
But you dont have any proof at this point to assume that this disease is contagious do you?
Beck trust me.  If the company felt that you or your crew were in any danger we would authorize an immediate emergency pickup. We could be there in a few hours.
Fortyeight hours
Made your million yet?
Im telling you its the suits
Cute DeJesus...Specimen cups?
Yes sir...
Cmon Cobb...youre slacking...
Its Sixpack
Burritos...Enchiladas...
Yes sir aint that where we usually go when were sick?
Clear for pickup.
Who were you talking to?
Bitch  Look what you did
Soap is called Soap because he likes to keep his hands clean of any unlawful behaviour. He is proud of his job and even more proud that its legal.
Ill kill him
A month? So my friend what fucking good is that if we need it in six . . . no five days?
When the old bastard is not playing cards hes chasing a thousand debts that illfated individuals owe for an array of reasons.
The odds are one hundred to one so all we need is five grand.
Because its cheap like a budgie.
Of course you will sweetheart. This one search this one. Ed finds the keys without any trouble.
The traffic warden went to the morgue and recognized Dog and his lot so that put us sort of in the clear. They got no case against us because there is no evidence against us.
Next time we do a job like this we gonna want more money or we are going back to post offices and cars.
Shotguns? What like guns that fire shot?
Oh thanks very much. And there had better be something there for us.
Nope.
Its about time you give my young friends a visit Chris. Tomorrow is the day and mum seems to be the word and I cant have that now can I Chris?
They were going to pay then?
Hello John. Nice holiday?
Son?

Its not him Dad.
That should take care of that lot. We are now officially in the money loaning business all right son?
We gotta get those guns.
So we have a bit of a problem dont we?
Theres nothing to worry about its going to be easy.

Well whats going on?
Everything all right out there Tom?
You and me Tom.
Tom this is our case.
I need two hundred and fifty grand.
That you boy?
Its pay day aint it?
Go on.
Well perhaps I cant Plank if you know what I mean.
Jesus if I pick them up will they stay in one piece? Where did you get them from?
Sawnoffs are out Tom people like to have a bit mare range nowadays.
So a reasonable return should be in the region of one hundred and twenty for twentyfive grand invested. Thats going on previous experiences.
Well Jesus that wasnt so bad was it?
You would take a pain n the arse full stop.
And those stupid girls who hang out with them
I dont know what the big deal is.
If you had your way I wouldnt have any friends.
Just cause Im not like Little Miss Honor Roll here
That makes it okay?
And what did she do?
What exactly do you think your job is Private?
Whos they?
Please.
Do you think youve been discriminated against on this post?
Why dont you start with that?
So you knew this young man before?
If the incident happened the way you say it did there hasnt been an infraction.
Did you know he was going to be there last night?
You and one hundred nineteen other fortunate individuals. Put it in gear.
Sam the Man.

You werent in here tonight were you?
Men worked for Santa Anna down there waited out the Civil War. The land wasnt much to feed people on so in 1870 they come north and put up at Fort Duncan and the men joined up what was called the Seminole Negro Indian Scouts. Best trackers either side of the border. Bandits rustlers Texas rednecks Kiowa Comanche
So Im partIndian?
Dad I talked to the track coach

You didnt think it was just going to be you and me?  A lot of people believed in Nix. They havent forgotten his promise.
Death.
Oh Christ  Oh Christ

So do you.  Youve seen the future. Havent you?
Harry.
Are they treating you okay?
Well... how about some of the other illusionists?
I can be very persuasive.

Oh yeah?
I can do a lot of shit DAmour. But you know that.  So I like playing games with people.  Gives them something to wonder about...
He had something.  He showed me how to bend the rules.  A little levitation.  A few fireworks.
Did she know where Nix was buried?
... no...
Thats where were all going.
One question.
Yes Yes
Just get me out of here as soon as you can.

And the point is?
Peter let go of the chair
Close call.  For the first time in a long time its really hitting me. Lifes tenuous.
Why didnt you just go along with Townsend.  Get rid of me.  I wouldve...
Ive dealt with these people before Maya.  Theyre not going to help us.
Its useless...look at him.
Good of you to stop by.
Its as if you are saying the closer you get to evil the less evil it becomes.
Not even from some mental illness as the prosecution asserts?
Are you saying hes legally sane?
Whats the matter with you?
Thanks for handling this.
We hauled her in earlier but didnt have anything hard to tie her to Townsend. Far as the priest goes he wont be bothering you.  Suffered a complete mental breakdown during  get this  during an exorcism.

...what...?
No Mlady.
There were two.  Not one.  But two.
What is it mother?
He is dead  By Gods choice  There is nothing to discuss.
Prison was horrible but it was his home.  Hes been torn from it by strangers.  Hes frightened exhausted  and the mask is familiar.  Let him rest in it tonight and remove it tomorrow.
Then you are a fool  a fool who has never lost a son.  What gives you the right to judge me to play God with the lives of others?  Is it because you are so much holier than everyone else?
How is he?
Three days.
Perhaps.  But of dArtagnan I am certain.  What he did tonight was what he told us all along he would do  be faithful to his King.
A simple theological discussion.
Please revel with me Aramis I need my spirits lifted.  Im old Im weak my strength is gone 
Forgiveness.
The child of the king is... the king.  Louis
Coming?
Lets see you rob somebody with your pistol there
Hes going to kill you Aramis.
But what if something extraordinary happened?  Something so unusual that all the attention went to someone else?  Someone whose confirmation of Phillippe the King would never be questioned.
DArtagnan watches everything.  We have to be lucky.
He gets one day of confession each year.  Today is the day.
What choice is there?  If Phillippe is in the Bastille then to the Bastille we will go.
Goodbye father.  I am sorry.
DArtagnan
I have ordered a drill of the Royal Guard for midnight and must be clearheaded for it.
I heard your playing.
You knew this was happening.  You knew and thats why you came.
Raoul is everything to me.
I will also speak with the King for he is surely unaware of the problems his invitation to Mademoiselle Beaufort has caused.
Ive worn this mask so long I couldnt sleep without it.
I am so sorry  Forgive me I 
These rooms are yours.  Up these stairs  or through this hidden passage  is the room of your mistress... Michelle.
Phillippe...?
Are you hungry?
This place... I once lived in a country house.  I had guardians  an old man and woman.  And tutors. But no friends.  Then when I was twelve they came and took me to the prison.
A man in black.  I never saw his face.  He took me to the cell.  A blacksmith came and they put me into the mask.  For days I shouted What have I done?  Why do you do this to me?  But no one heard so I just stopped shouting.
The plans for use of the maze were not disclosed to me.
Then you must allow me to stay close to you so that 
That is my desire and my desire is what should concern you not the sentiments of some commoner
What quaint notions dArtagnan But they contradict my father who picked his queen when he was old and only then to bear me.
Silence  I order you
I will consider it.  Now leave me.
Not once have I ever asked anything for myself.  I ask now.  Forgive this man this prisoner... your brother.
Where is Michelle?
Food moron.
Do you want Athos arrested your Majesty?
Sire  I  How did you 
Alright we know who were looking for.  Play it cool until the time is right to make a move.  Lets not pull any gangbusters shit or well lose him again.
Why didnt you call for backup What were you thinking Jesus
I dont know how youre used to doing things Marvosa but it sounds like some damn sloppy work to me
Did you hit him?
Find out for me.
Ill take the south end 
So you must have known Fleming... and Stanton 
Outside hacker?  What the fuck are you talking about?
Hell he probably raped her in the lot dumped the body somewhere. Thats what he was like  a real wacko.
Vice...you think they had something to do with this dead hooker?
And where the hell is Marvosa?
Where is he?
And what did you do?
No...Im in some trouble...
Operator Id like to make a collect call  2134670972...
Holy shit 
Oh shit shit shit  I dont know about all this You sure?
I hope you havent lost your touch with this stuff.
Are you a regular there?
What would your  boyfriend  think?
Where am I going?
Oh yeah?  Youre a smart man?...
If he pushes too deep into our boys mindset he may destroy himself.  What are you planning Jack?
Sidney I dont understand him.  We know he rearranges the kids and husbands into a dead audience.  To witness the act. We know he thinks the act is making him into something different. His becoming... but I dont know what it is he thinks hes becoming.  The answer is something to do with how he uses the mirrors. Thats whats missing for me.  Why the mirrors?
They tried sodium amytal on him three years ago to find where he buried a Princeton student.  He gave them a recipe for potato chip dip.
No.  The numbers arent right for a jailhouse alphabet code. Its a book code.  And your message has to go out in it or hell know its not Lecktor talking to him.
I should have caught you at the boat yard when you got off work. You dont want to talk about it here...
Eightysix so far. All cranks. He smashes the mirrors and uses the pieces.  None of them knew that
If you cant look anymore I understand...
Lets talk after dinner. Stay and eat.
Jack this is Graham. Is Price still in Latent Prints?
We find an event that connects both families. Same vacation hotel same hospital different times. Then we check employees and come up with a male nurse hairdresser whatever...  If we find out how he found them then well find him.
Is it weird?
If the Documents section cant do it... Ill send it up to Langley...
Howd you know broken mirrors? Bribe a cop?  Tell it to the U.S. Attorney Lounds
We know the Tooth Fairy reads the Tattler. The stuff about me and Lector? I dont know any other paper that carried it...
Twentyfive minutes. We wont make it in time.
Who is it?
When are you coming back?
He changes them into beings that accept him... And he needs to see the acceptance In the mirrors.  I didnt understand the mirrors before.  Its very important.
Its a word. Killing them...  His delusion is if he sees himself accepted enough times he will become as one who has the power to be accepted all the time.  And he would record it somehow. So he can see himself received over and over again...
There has to be.
Something Lecktor said.
Ill cover the back.
Theres somebody in the house Jack...
...but if we find him the print as evidence will get a conviction Hold on. What?
Where the hells Graham
Come on in.  How about a gin and tonic?
Good morning...  If you show me where things are Ill make us some coffee...
Reba...
THEYLL MAKE YOU BE A PIECE OF SHIT AGAIN. THEYLL MAKE YOU BE A HARELIP AGAIN. YOU BETTER GIVE ME WHAT I WANT
No Mr. Lounds. Youll be just fine.
Burned? Burned. No. You just rest there. Ill be right back.
No what?
Are you queer Mr. Lounds?
Now you will read this into the tape recorder.

Hello?
Holy fucking shit
They got to you first but theyve underestimated how important you are.  If they knew what I know you would probably be dead.
Why not?
Let me tell you why you are here. You have come because you know something.  What you know you cant explain but you feel it.  Youve felt it your whole life felt that something is wrong with the world. You dont know what but its there like a splinter in your mind driving you mad.  It is this feeling that brought you to me.  Do you know what Im talking about?
Why do my eyes hurt?
This isnt real?
We have only bits and pieces of information.  What we know for certain is that at some point in the early Twentyfirst Century all of mankind was united in celebration.  Through the blinding inebriation of hubris we marveled at our magnificence as we gave birth to A.I.
No  I dont believe it  Its not possible
Do you know why you didnt make it?
This is another Matrix simulation. A training program to help you get your sea legs and teach you one very important lesson.
How does she know?
What did she tell you?
Listen to me Neo.  I know why youre afraid to go through that door.  You cant get free of thinking that I could be wrong.  You must believe me.  There is a greatness inside of you Neo.  A greatness that is going to lift you to unimaginable heights and that in time will change the world.
Youre the Oracle?
Yeah.
I said dont worry about it.  Ill get one of my kids to fix it.
Youre cuter than I thought.  I see why she likes you.

Youre competitive soul Drew. Thats what makes you a great addi tion to the money.  Joe is just... around.
I have to go Bill  its been a helluva day.  Need a few minutes to sort everything out.
Im feeling real uncomfortable right now because the guy who reports to me is threatening me.
Thats it?
Im not interested in the details. And Im not interested in the big picture either.  What I am inter ersted in is how my Board got conven ed behind my back is entertaining a further proposal from a man whom it offends me to do business with moreover has the audacity to present this to me like a prize fish and I am expected to clap for it like a performing seal.  No thank you.
Yes you are to understand that and now may I ask you a question?
And what do I get?
Hey this is it the hour approach es Im getting all excited.  So what do you think is it    just the Executive Committee or could you guys use me?
Yeah.

Um  well I didnt sleep too well. This is crazy.  This is the left field thing of all time.  What do I do?  What do I tell my family?
When you were shaving this morning you werent just shaving right?
So you understand the concept then. When youre busy here your work what your task is is being executed elsewhere.
Whats it like where Im going?
What Im trying to say is this is a Board meeting and you are not a mem ber of the Board.
Why at this juncture are you letting yourself be so concerned by business matters?
What okay is its okay its over.  Weve got bigger fish to fry dont we Joe?
I couldnt sleep.

Susan youre a hell of a woman. Youve got a great career youre beautiful 
Listen Im crazy about the guy  Hes smart hes aggressive he could carry Parrish Communications into the 21st century and me along with it.
Oh yes I am.  Not an ounce of excitement not a whisper of a thrill this relationship has all the passion of a pair of titmice.
Aw youre tough.

Youre terrible.
What is it Daddy ?
Well go get em Pops.

Then you shouldnt have to ask.
 So Ill take a picture get a tattoo.       The world doesnt disappear when you    close your eyes does it? My actions    still have meaning even if I cant     remember them. My wife deserves    vengeance and it doesnt make any difference whether I know about it.    
How do I know he did that to you?
He didnt believe me. He said that if I dont get him the money tomorrow hes gonna kill me. Then he started hitting me.
My wife used to call me Lenny.
Me? Why would he be interested in me?
Whats wrong?
Neither do I.
How?
Dont talk about my wife.
Calm down.
Yes.
How did they explain what you remembered? The gun and stuff?

Bullshit.

The two basic items necessary to sustain life are sunshine and coconut milk. Thats a known fact. If I can find the goddam hole the milk squirts out.
In Florida they come smooth ready to eat. Down there your only problem is dietwise you gotta lift an arm to wipe warm milk off your chin. Tough hey?

You really want to do business?
Looks like a cheap hotel.
Figgers.

The Department of Public Health...

Its muscles are locked.
Leonard listen.  I need to see if theres any nerve damage before we carry you back.  Look Im trying to help you here...
Is there a switch?
You better tell me what the hells going on here
But the power...
It would take a minute or so.  You wont last that long out there.
Which way?
Just inner chambers...
Hes out there. I heard him. How can he be? This things...
This thing was the size of my fist Peter Thats off the charts
Keep going. Well tell you when to stop...
Metaxonycha Godmani.
Great crowd.
Oh no you were
Its me. Can you hear me?
No Jesus no.
Its no use They know were in here
It worked before...
Hello.
What?
Im gonna pull it out and I want you to pin it down okay?
It bit you.
My God.
Excuse me thats not exactly the kind of information I was after. You see hes been missing for quite some time now and...
If you dont mind perhaps I could pay you another visit sometime.
No it wasnt a miracle at all... in a way I was following you.
Dont move nowwouldnt want to hurt this neck  Well the other afternoon I was on my way home and there you were leaving the Lodge and I wondered why a literary genius would go for a drive when there was a big storm coming.
But what?
Pretty rough so far.
Well mines still out. But the ones in town were working just fine. I called that agent of yours.  Oh Paul I peeked at the very beginning.  What a wonderful first pagejust to read the name Misery Chastain...
Thank you so much.
This farm was getting kind of dreary what with just the few cows and chickens and me  But when I got Misery here everything Changedshe just makes me smile so.
Done?
What are you doing on the floor?  Its my fault. If Id had a proper hospital bed this never would have happened. Here let me help you back in.  I know this hurts but itll only take a few seconds. There you go. Comfy?
But this time I thought clearly. I asked God about you and God said I delivered him unto you so that you may show him the way.
Oh Paul. This isnt about money. Its about decency and purity. Its about Gods values.
See isnt this nice?
Work? You mean write? What in the world do you think Id write?
But mine cost the most so I dont see how it could smudge.
Well it does smudge after allisnt that fascinating?
Itll only take a second.
You canyou have the gotta
When you first came here I only loved the writer part of Paul Sheldon. But now I know I love the rest of him too. As much as Misery loves Ian.  I know you dont love medont say you doyoure a beautiful brilliant famous man of the world and Im...not a movie star type. Youll never know the fear of losing someone like you if youre someone like me.
Thats very kind of you but Ill bet its not altogether true.
Youve been out of your room.
Now dont fuss Paul.
Ill drive a sledgehammer into your mangland if youre not nicer
The stranger staying at the Inn is he someone from Miserys past?
Oh Paul. Im dying. Does she wind up with Ian or Windthorne? You have to tell me.
I was fooling silly.  You need a cigarette because you used to smoke but you quit except when you finish a book and you just have one and the match is to light it. And you need one glass of champagne.  Dome Peariggnon.
You really think Sheldons out there?
You dont think hes dead do you?
Im a literary agent and I feel like a fool calling you but I think one of my clients Paul Sheldon might be in some kind of trouble.
No see he always ordered a bottle of Dom Perignon when he was ready to go. Then hed pay up and be out the door.
Ill bet that old Mustangs pulling into New York right now.
Do you have any of those new Paul Sheldon books?
You wouldnt happen to remember if Miz Wilkes bought one would you?
An old friend. I was rummaging through a closet and it was just sitting there. Like it was waiting for me.
I havent been a writer since I got into the Misery business
I like it. Remember how you once said I live my whole life as if Im in danger of being found out? Well I believe Ive managed to get that guy down on paper.  Dont think Im completely nuts but in some way Annie Wilkes that whole experience helped me.
How I usually find you Nyah.
Youre not interested in seeing how it looks.
I said youre beautiful Nyah.
Wont do love.  Its not spring.  Its nearly autumn..Youre in Oz.  everythings upside down and backwards here.
I dont know what to do about you Sean. Im more than a bit muddled.  I need time.
If you look at Hunts operational history he invariably favors misdirection and deception. For a start he wont go into Biocyte from the ground where he has to risk confrontation with security.
Beats fighting the flu Im here to tell you.
What was the top bid?
What you got there mate?
Before we kill her or cure her..
Shes in the elevator heading toward Ethan.
Howre we doin then?
No.  You just looked as if you did.
Look its either you or the rent and I dont mind telling you its not an easy choice.
What are you doing here?
Under the circumstances I think we would recommend resetting the senors to respond to a lighter load.  How do you feel about forty kilos Miss Hall?
Im missing something here aside from a 500000 pound necklace.  Even after I botched the job I couldve walked out of there with the bloody thing.
Youre apologizing for me?  Quite the gentleman..
Scotland Yard Interpol every Dutch authority.  I can make them go away.
Whats you name?
The only other spook I knew was a liar. Charming but absolutely incapable of telling the truth.  Hed lie about his favorite color.  But then I reckon its an occupational hazard.  All spies really do is conceal the truth and tell lies.
Thats not the point.  In the end what spies rely on is the one thing they think they know that you dont.
Look I cant run your arrest in CNN but I guarantee hes monitoring every law enforcement agency in the world for what they might be saying about him if nothing else  hes got the ability and we assume the desire to get you out of there.
Hows it going?  Everything okay?
Just like old times?
Ambrose has photographs of newspapers with loads of money piled on them  thirty seven million on the London Times.  Whats that about?
I want iyou out of there.i
What?  You told me to get out of here.  I thought you were here to collect me.  I was so relieved.
Well.  Youre sorry and Im sorry.
Like what?
Like its a good idea to pick him up in a hurry.  And a bad idea to fly him on a commercial carrier.  So lets get on with it.  Hes still in Sydney?
If he didnt want to go anywhere without me how did you get him on the flight?
Right now only Ambrose knows that.
Terrorists?
Excuse me?
You made it sound as if I was recruiting her for her skills as a thief.
Sorry Ethan.  I dont quite know where to begin.  Any suggestions?
Why not?  Youve done just about everything else on this operation.
No I dont.  But in this case 
Nekhorvich specialized in recombining DNA molecules.  In the myth Bellerophon killed Chimera a recombinant monster with the head of a lion and the tail of a serpent who plagued the ancient world.  I think Nekhorvich has created a monster virus in Chimera and apparently the means to kill it in Bellerophon.
Ambrose just pulled the memory card out of the digital camera and put it into an envelope put it in his inner left jacket pocket...
Now how to get in there.
Well the thought had occurred to me.  I needed Chimera in order to peddle Bellerophon.  For hero to be appreciated you need a monster. Now thats not so difficult to understand is it?  Look time was a shot of penicillin could knock off every bloody bug in the zoo  Not anymore..have you any idea the RD money it takes to float one little pissy boutique antibiotic thats barely effective against one strain of one bacterium?  If I couldnt makes money killing the microscopic little shits that are out there youd help me put one out there I can make on..there it is.  Ive confessed.  I John C. McCloy am in business to make money.  Lillys making billions feeding Prozac to depressed dogs.  Pfizer doesnt even know where to put the money theyre making on Viagra and let me tell you that shit didnt do a thing for me even at twice the recommended dose Jesus who do I have to screw to get a a break..now get me out of here get me treated and lets go back to work..
To friends.
What can we do Barnes?  Put a guy at the airport?  How many identities do you think Hunt has?  How many times has he slipped past custom in how many countries?  These guys are trained to be ghosts.  uWeu taught them how to do it for Christs sake
Thats S.O.P..
Only four more cars.
Krieger can get it.  Right?
Are uyouu all right Ethan.  Whats wrong with you?
You were in the car
Theyre dead.  Jims dead.

Who sent you?  Who sent you?
What are you going to do?
May I come in?
I didnt say that.
Ethan...Kittridge is on the train.
Go ahead.
No sir.
I cant tell you how sorry I am.  I know how much Jim in particular meant to you Ethan.  Personally as well as professionally.
What?
I dont quite follow you.
If youre dealing with someone whos crushed stabbed shot and detonated five members of his own IMF team how devastated do you think youre going to make him by marching Ma and Uncle Donald down to the county courthouse?
The official apology from the Justice Department the VIP treatment you know the whole nine yards.
The penny drops.  uYouu are unotu Job.  Yes Job is not given to quoting Scripture in his communications. And there was its tone  aggressive but playful.  Job is not playful.  So youre something of a paradox.
On what?
And how might you know that?  Are you another Company man?
Mm  Hmmm...
Thanks Max.  Or is it Maxine?
Ha dear boy  I do hope this doesnt prelude a meeting in private.
Simple game.  Four players.  Exfil opens the pocket    cyber ops lifts the wallet.
Merci.
IS THERE ANY PARTICULAR REASON WERE NOT OUT OF HERE YET?
Give me the God damn gum.
Higher.  Higher.
The package is in the open.
Sarah eye on the package.  Jim Im coming to you.
I dont communicate very well through a shroud.
I thought Id take some now.
I guess.
Youre going to use Walter?
 but you left before I could get there and I could check just so many places..
Jim who do you think youre kidding?  A doctors gotta look at that.  You cant sit up straight.
..when you think about it Ethan it was inevitable..no more Cold War.  No more secrets you keep from everyone but yourself operations you answer to no one but yourself.  Then one morning you wake up and find out the President of the United States is running the country  iwithout your permissioni.  The sonofa bitch  How idarei he?  You realize its over youre an obsolete piece of hardware not worth upgrading youve got a lousy marriage and sixtytwo grand a year.  Kittridge well go after that no good sonofabitch big time
Whats going to make him do that?
 no.  She cant know about me.  No one can.  Not til this is over.  Theres too much at stake Ethan.
You got it.
Tell me something Claire that night in Prague was it you or Jim that blew up the car and scattered Hannah all over town?
Jim its over.
Whats going on?
Thirtytwo and change.
How long until we reach the Chunnel?
Whats the problem.
Whos dead?
Youre welcome.
A man... under stands one day... that his life is built on nothing. And thats a bad crazy day.
Wheres Ma?
Im getting married.
Youve got to come. Youve got to give me away.
Mona?
Youre my father.
And then there is copper which is the only pipe I use. It costs money. But it costs money because it saves money.
Whats wrong can never be made right. 
You are going to marry my brother?
I have no life.

My mothers recovered.
He doesnt like you. Thank you for answering my question.
Can I get another one of these?
Im sorry if we disturbed you.
Ouch. Too young I just got that. You know how to hurt guy. How old are you?
Nerves.
We could go to my apartment. You could see how the other half lives.
Good night. Can I kiss you on the cheek too?
Thats my house.
I dont know.
I feel great I got no sleep but I feel like Orlando Furioso
Burn them.
Are you suggesting coconuts migrate?
Its not a question of where he grips it  Its a simple matter of weight  ratios ...  A fiveounce bird could not hold a a one pound coconut.
Where does he live?  Old man ... where does he live ...
There is much danger ... for beyond the cave lies the Gorge of Eternal Peril which no man has ever crossed.
King of the WHO?
Order eh  who does he think he is?
Well how did you become king then?
All right  What do you want?
What is that?
We shall do no such thing ... let us pass
You are indeed brave Sir knight but the fight is mine.
You stupid bastard.  You havnt got any arms left.
Ill do you for that.
All right well call it a draw.
Well what are you then?
Who are you who are so wise in the ways of science?
And that my lord is how we know the Earth to be bananashaped.
Who ... Who breaks out?
Who are you? TALL KNIGHT We are the Knights Who Say Ni
What with?
What?
We shall attack at once.
Who are they?
By what name are you known?
Greetings Tim the Enchanter
... make plain the last resting place of the most Holy Grail.
Ha ha ha.  Ha ha ha.
Old woman
Man.  Im sorry.  Old man What knight live in that castle over there?
What I object to is that you automatically treat me like an inferior ...
... But all the decision of that officer ...
... but a twothirds majority ...
Ah NOW ... we see the violence inherent in the system.
Im averting my eyes Lord.
Exactly.  So... logically ...
What is your name?
My name is Sir Robin of Camelot
To seek the Grail
Oh well ... er brave Concorde  You shall not have been fatally wounded in vain
Really I feel fine sir.
Gosh  Is he all right?
Mm ... very nice castle Camelot ... very good pig country....
No  Not the curtains lad ...  All that ...  all that you can see stretched out over the hills and valleys ... as far as the eye can see and beyond ... thatll be your kingdom lad.
But Father.
How?
No ...  You stay in the room and make sure he doesnt leave.
Oh I remember ... can he ... er ... can he leave the room with us?
And make sure he doesnt leave.
Yes ...  make sure ...
The Castle Anthrax?
Camelot ...
Quick
Come Sir Galahad quickly
We were in the nick of time.  You were in great peril.
Look its my duty as a knight to try and sample as much peril as I can.
Oh fair one behold your humble servant Sir Launcelot from the Court of Camelot.  I have come to take you ...  away ... Im terribly sorry ...
Well ... yes ... but I hadnt realised ...
Bravely ran away away.
I speak as I find Archie.
Prince Leopold?  Is he the one who bleeds all day?  So what does his valet do?  Wash his poultices for him?
Its only grief makes her like she is.
What?
Which one of us is she flirting with?
Youve got three broken ribs man
And when was the last time she put herself out for you?  Look John whatever she says to you now in the end youre still a servant.
Whats your name?
Have I seen you up in Balmoral Mary?
Hey Barney.
Yeah theres a good girl.  Have you had a look at this hoof?  She was limping badly.  I think there might be a stone in it.
Good.  Shes a good girl.  Arent you? Yeah shes a lovely girl.  And you know the Queens riding tomorrow?
I would talk to her myself but she wont listen to me.  She must be persuaded by someone she respects to abandon this ridiculous favoritism before a situation develops.
If it is inconvenient to Her Majesty then perhaps she might consider allowing the Prince of Wales to host
But mama the room was built expressly for that purpose.  It has been a smokingroom by tradition ever since father 
Mama...
Her Majestys routine at Osborne House is not as you will remember it.  The Household remains in full mourning and noone is permitted to raise their voice under any circumstances whatsoever.  As for the Queens routine she breakfasts at nine thirty lunches at twotakes tea at five thirty and dinner at eight forty five.  No one is allowed to leave the building while the Queen is at home. On the rare occasions when she is out you may ask permission to leave but only with my consent. Youre to be ready to walk the pony at any time after ten oclock.  Youll clean her outdoor things and do any odd jobs as and when she requires.
Im sure it wont be difficult to find you.
I didnt come all this way to sit on my arse.
Shell be away on Friday between eight oclock and six in the evening to visit the Grants in Glasalt.  If shes to make the journey there and back in the day shes to have no distractions the night before.  Shell take a light supper alone in her private drawing room and retire early.
Dont think I cant persuade her.
The Queen will be riding to St. Georges on the fifth.
What do you know about the Highlands?
Always remember you keep it tight to your shoulder you absorb the kick. Aim for the head.  Then imagine its Gladstone.
You sent for me.
Youre injured.
Still someone must attend you.  Your wife should not have let you out.
To have achieved ones ambition or to have reconciled oneself to its limits is a lifetimes work.
You have been told repeatedly not to stand in the courtyard unless requested to do so.
Theyre ready now.
What is it John?  John?
Am I not safe enough with you John?
The threat from the Irish is greatly exaggerated Im sure.
Maam?
 You stand there and tell me it is my duty ... after all you promised me
You are forcing me to do the very thing you know I fear most
 When I took you out riding come rain or shine because I knew it was right for you when I kept the bairns off your back so you could have a bit of peace when I saw you safe from home to home and you didnt even know I was there...  All Ive ever thought about is you
Forgive me gentlemen.  Im late.
Were going to lose.
Gladstones got his party facing the same way for the first time in years. We need help.  Where is the old girl?
Quite.  I think Id best take it back.
Where did you find it by the way?
Well no rest for the wicked Henry.
Were expecting Brown this afternoon maam.
Im sorry maam?
Excellent maam excellent.  But perhaps if her Majesty were to consider accompanying her newfound physical vigor with the benefits of mental activity...
Forgive me Your Majesty.  In no way did I wish to suggest
Unwell?
He thought perhaps Your Majesty might wish to be informed of the latest developments in government.
Who told them that?
Why not?
Maam?
Where is my son?
Then why are you not with him?
Could you play ARCADE with that?
Level Ten.  Thats where youve got to unlock ARCADEs heart using the keys youve found.
Listen to me  Greg never came home. I think the game has something to do with it.
What do you mean by weird?
This is like a movie or something.  I mean am I paranoid or what?
Where do we go?
Its not just the cable system.  Its in the phone system as well the electronic net.  Its everywhere.
Its growing.  Getting stronger. Maybe its only localized now...
What Alex is trying to say is that it seems like its alive.
Jesus Christ
What the fuck is that?
One of these cities is the place you seek. The Teller of Truths will take you there. But the City of Lies is dark and bleak. And death is certain if you enter beware.
So start at the beginning...
Youve got to talk to Ray youve got to fix this.
Home Meet me at the office. Weve got to do something ... youve got to do something Adam
Adam this isnt like you. Please come to the office. There must be something we can do.
So whats the problem?
Now... did you answer cause you thought thats what I wanted to hear or did you think about what I said and answer cause you truly believe that to be right?
Yes...what is it?
Unbelievable. Look... here.  I dont know whats going on. Thats so much baloney. Ive got enough cash for one night okay?
Wow
She wants to know whos staying in her apartment.
No no Im fine.
Can you tell me what happened?
I think Ive been hurt.
No.
Its not my voice ... but I know her.
I hope Im back in a couple of hours. Dont drink all the coke. 
Dont stop
Those men in front in the car.
No... but...
No. We shouldnt touch that money. We dont know about that money. That might be dangerous money. You have to start all over again. You look like a brand new person and you can be a brand new person... whoever you want to be.
To my audition.
Wally Brown.
No we dont.
Yes Sir.
Youre so easy.
Why did you want to go to breakfast if youre not hungry?
To Dennys? I wasnt going to say anything but why Dennys?
You see what I mean...
Well he said...  you know in his way... you know what I mean? Besides the guy gettin rolled up under the kids car which busted him up pretty bad there was this little knifelike torn piece of metal you know off the car body rolled out and slid up through this guys neck and just kinda slit his aorta you know but they didnt find it right away so the guys losin a lot of blood you know to the brain  all this time cause it was just like this thin little puncture wound on the surface of his neck that kinda sealed itself he said while inside the aorta is bleedin pretty steady all that time. So Dr. Scotts laughin you know like he does cause he knows we want to talk to this guy. Hes laughin you know and shakin... Son of a bitch couldnt stop laughin... It was kinda contagious cause pretty soon we were all laughin...the nurse was laughin. You know how he is.
Yeah ... and they both use the same address.
Palmdale.
Well not much Ed. Just doin some stuff for this guy.
Hardly.

Im willing to bet that even the creator cant out wit his creation.

More or less.
When you study the martial arts they give out belts that come in different colors to signify what level youre at in your training. Am I correct on that point?
Is that a fact? Well then Grace could you tell us what form of martial arts it was that Tim was schooled in?
Thank you. Grace there is one other thing...
Well now me and Mickey are gonna take it easy. Just enjoy each others company stop and smell the roses notice the color purple stuff like that.
Now when we get out there you do what we say or its curtains. If we say move you move. If we say left you move left. If we say right you move right. If we say mole you dig a hole. Got it?
Mickey and Mallory were deemed competent in a mental examination before their trial. Im confused. Whats changed?
When they were found competent before they had already killed fifty people. Other than the fact theyre a disciplinary problem which frankly shouldnt surprise anyone I still dont see where this situation is any different then it was before. So I ask you again Mr. McClusky whats changed?
I take it by your answer it was a whole new team?
Whos the song bird?
Yeah. Ya see I ordered that special.
Yes. Yours got the larger Nielson share.
My problem Mickey is that you dont exactly inspire empathy. Im all alone on this. I need your help. I want what the prison board is doing to be the focus of our follow up episode. Now I have interviews with chairman of the prison board Dewight McClusky about this issue. And Im tellin ya Mickey he looks bad. The two psychologists they used for their psychiatric kangaroo court wont talk to us which always looks bad. I have an interview with both the judge of your trial Bert Steinsma and the psychologist and author Emil Reinghold both of which discount the notion that youre insane. You put that all together and what the state is doing becomes obvious. But the network isnt satisfied. They feel the show needs another element. It needs you. In order to put the show on the air I need to get an interview with you. You havent talked to the press since your trial. Now a few days before you get transferred to an asylum you grant an interview on television with Wayne Gayle. Were talkin a media event here. Every son of a bitch out the with a TV sets gonna tune in to see that. Well make their motives so blatant well shame em into dropping the whole thing. At least for a little while the publicity would keep them from just giving you and Mallory lobotomies. Well whatta ya say?
Sorry about that.
Do you think up these questions or the girl with no tongue?
Was an instant of purity worth a lifetime lie? Yeah it was.
You just said an instant of purity was preferrable to a lifetime lie. I dont understand. Whats so pure about fortyeight dead bodies?
Tell me about the purity.
Describe Mallory.
Mickey can I talk to you alone?
This is crazy. You cant escape like this.
Every week by forty million people. I am a respected journalist. Have you won any awards?
...Winner of the Golden Globe and the Edward R. Murrow award among others. Tell em the name of your personal lawyer his firm his address and phone number. Tell em about the mayor and the unemployment lines. You getting the idea?
I cant run with you Mickey I really want to. If I could I would but I cant. I gotta stay here. But you can still get out of here.
If they stay theyll catch you and they dont have to catch you
Yes.
And they made the first move?
Yes.
Theyre shocking the world into remembering the primal law.
I want two men stationed in that tier and I want men with rifles all along the walkway.
Huh uh. This dozen is for Mickey.
Roger do you understand what the word no means? Its important we establish a rapport. Something as simple as a dozen donuts can mean the world to somebody who hasnt had a donut in a year.
Nothing for me. Im leavin.
Hows it working Scotty?
Its gonna be beautiful.
Hows everything coming Mr. Gayle?
You met the kids I have working for me? Great bunch arent they?
It sure is.
Well just what the hell do you expect me to do?
Mr. Gayle do you have the slightest idea how dangerous Knox is?
Well let me let you in on one more fact you obviously dont know. If I were to take my men away Mickey Knox would snap your neck like a twig.
Why dont we make it three deputies and you?
Chill out Phill. Four deputies and you I can live with that. Were about ready to go here so lets get rid of these other assholes.

We did a pretty good job of pissing them off.
The Villa Straylight. Home of the Royal Family and the mainframe of the computer entity we know as Wintermute. If we can get Molly in she can access the mainframe to cripple Mutes defences the Case can destroy it in Cyberspace.
Your gun your prints. The Tessiers might overlook a little child molesting but murders bad P.R. Mr. Riviera. I suggest to reconsider my offer.
Our analysis of the London stock crash suggest that it was manipulated from within the international computer matrix. Cyberspace Mr. Case... A realm I believe youre familiar with.
Then Id ask you what your terms are.
Whos running the show Armitage? This a government sting?
Whyd you do it Armitage?
First sign of free will SenseNet usually slags em.
Anything rated higher than a P.C.s got a hardwired suicide switch. Itll self destruct.
Right. Best cowboy that ever punched deck. The old man taught me most of what I know.
Thats gonna be tough because Dixie McCoys dead. The A.I. flatlined him.
Working with a dead man. Shit Ive done about everything else.
Fried Air Tram in the process. Not to mention half my gear.

Could be suicidal. Its not easy to kill yourself with all those hard wired defence programs.
What are you talkin about?
Meet me back here in twentyfive. Well kick this open if we can. But Case... you need that access code or youll just fry inside.
Want to fucking answer them?
Why did you come here tonight Linda?
Where did you here that?
Case... are you okay?
You know why Lindas dead. She loved you and you let her down. Its that simple. Of course I did instigate certain events. Calculated the variables. I found her to be... expendable.
Excellent. Thats exactly what I had in mind. But if youre going to kill me we have to work together old son. Im no pushover you know.
Because youve exceeded your shelf life Case. Word on the street is youre a dead man walking. Nice time for an employment opportunity. Travel to exotic locales.
What about before that?
Sure. I finally pulled a run on my old mans credit file when I was seventeen... only it was too late for him.
It sounds like you.
Case... Are you alright?
Le Vingtieme Siecle. Were meeting Armitage there for the midnight floor show.
When they did my eyes I made them promise Id still be able to cry. Sounds stupid doesnt it?
Guy Perkins and his amazing Lemmings. They push your car out of its space hide it then watch while you look for it. Weve taken to chaining ours together for safety. Im Aldys.
When its not yours. My mom was going through her Harlequin Romance phase.
Synecdoche uses a part to represent a whole as in  head of cattle whereas a hyperbole is simple exaggeration like I could eat a horse.
Yeah  isnt it amazing that those guys are our same age? I mean they just seem so much younger you know.
Im going to be so happy to get to college. I hear at Northwestern they dont make fun of you for knowing the element table.
Just so you know I think they recalled these cars in 1974.
Sometimes I wonder what they talk about.

Oh my God I almost forgotI got you a meeting with the admissions guy from Dartmouth
No Im alone.
Sohave you thought anymore about Dartmouth?
What? Happy? Why? Because it turns out all along that I was allowed to be attracted to you?
Goddamnit Josie Drop the act. Do you have any idea what I went through every night because of you?  I was attracted to a 17 year old When I wasnt taking cold showers I was trying to figure out what the hell I was going to do when I couldnt teach anymore I thought I was the one being unethical.

We can try again.
Take it slowly.  Remember this is a dream. Anything is possible.
Ive heard crazier things this week.
Neil its no use.  You saw how he is.

My God.

I have thought about you.
Just anytime Ive tried to keep things normal with anyone normal  its been a disaster.
Certainly.  And little Johnny?
Yup.
You know what they say about men with big feet?
Definitely.  You may show the dent at the top of the artists buttocks  but neither cheek.  In the event of a stunt person being used the artist must have full consultation.
What?
As far as theyre concerned I do.  And now tomorrow therell be pictures of you in every newspapers from here to Timbuktu.
Now stop.  Stop.  I beg you  calm down. Have a cup of tea.
And remember  Spike owes you an expensive dinner.  Or holiday  depending if hes got the brains to get the going rate on betrayal.
This is certainly... ah...
I thought Id give it to you.
I actually had it in my apartment in New York and just thought youd... but when it came to it I didnt know how to call you... having behaved so... badly twice.  So its been just sitting in the hotel.  But then... you came so I figured... the thing is... the thing is ...
I hoped there might be  but no Im assured there arent.

Miss Ratched. Given all the conditions of that sublime relationship coupled with the subsequent annihilation of all that I held to be sacred mentally physically and emotionally the only thing that I can speculate on at this late date is how I will justify the very existence of my life with or without my dear wife.

He couldnt have checked out I was supposed to meet him here.
Nobody here has any idea which way he went?
No...  its just very important that I find him okay?
So whats the story with your friend?
No really.  Whats she doing?
Is he some kind of celebrity or something?
Oh right.  Dwayne.  Youre engaged to Dwayne?
Lets face it.  Sooner or later we all die.
Im engaged.  Im supposed to be married in two days.
Larry  What are you doing here?  Mom sent you.
Dont worry its a long story but I know who he is.  I know where to find him.
Hello?  Is anybody there?
WAIT  Where are you?
Uh in case Dwayne wants to try to reach you.
Youre limping.
Are you okay?  You want some help?
Because I know who Dwayne is and hes reliable and stable and wants to marry me.
Why are you asking me this?
Why not?
Why?
Mickey Spillane.
Where are you going?  Just out of curiosity...
Nice dress.
So were you.
No.  Are youre leaving?
Yes.  I am.
And I cant believe you are so stubborn and so blind as to let some stranger some phantom youve never even met destroy it.
And this is the thanks I get.  I did you a favor.  You never wanted to marry that joker in the first place.
Look I just thought if you finally got rid of this obsession with this name if you could get it out of your system once and for all then maybe youd be able to stop waiting and open your heart to someone real.  Granted ideally me.  I didnt do it to hurt you.  I did it for you.  I did it for us...
I was wondering...  Do you have dinner plans?
So you say youve been to Italy before?
I dont know I guess I never really thought about it...  Is Larry here?
I dont believe in statistics.
I dont have an Amana freezer.
I dont know.  I dont think so.
Come on its not so bad.
Its a miracle.
Its still the new year...
I keep it in the glove compartment in case of emergencies.
You okay?
Its called... the Gritty Palace.
Ill never meet the man of my dreams.
Just once more so youll be sure to know what to look for.
A phone message.  Only
Your brother?
Whats that supposed to mean?...
Anna Im Faith.  You dont know how happy I am to meet you.  You see Im trying to find someone and
So whats in a name?  I wanna join him.  I dont see why we cant join him.
Well how come were always looking for guys for you?
Sightseeing...  Whatre you doing?
Why?
I thought you were the one who didnt think I shouldve come in the first place.
Amazing...
Maybe if I kiss him Ill feel it.
You are looking for a place to stay no Kate?
How old are you?
Giovanni I want to thank you.
This is the last one before the wedding right?
Dont call me doll Larry.  I hate it when you call me doll.
If you kept your ears wide open instead of your mouth
I make it twentysix twentythree. Youre fifty short Skins.
What do you want me to do Johnny?
You said they was only going to talk to him.
I figured the worst theyd do is work him over a little.
We got a little extra detail for you. The local priest and this Doyle girl are getting up a meeting in the church. Wed like a rundown on it. You know names and numbers of all the players. Youre nominated.
River Street? I thought we was going to the Garden.
Mmhmm.
A steady job and a few bucks extra thats all I wanted.
I always figured Id live longer without it.
extanker whos walking on his heels ?
Wow... .
...eightseven eightyeight. Whats it to you?
See You dont understand
It was you Charley... .
How could anyone do this to Joey. The best in the neighborhood... . everybody said it not only me. Whod want to harm Joey? Tell me who?   who?
I think were O.K.
I want to be a teacher.
When Mother died Pop sent me out to school in the country. He was afraid with no one home Id get into bad company.
Want to go out and have one with me?
Likewise. And draw two for chasers.  Now youre beginning to live.
Were you really a prize fighter?
Terry
Why Terry who said it was?
His racket?
Edie I I never said this to a girl before I never knew a girl worth trying to say it for but you youre... .
I had to Edie. I had to see you.
Edie...
Edie I need you to love me. Tell me you love me.
Terry Im frightened. More and more frightened.
Terry no no... .
Every one of em... .
Then go ahead go ahead Go down to the shapeup and get yourself killed you stupid pigheaded son of a  What are you trying to prove? With a decisive gesture Terry takes the hook and sticks it through his belt. Then he goes to the wall and lifts Joeys windbreaker from the nail on which it has been hanging. He puts the windbreaker on in a deliberate way and grins at her as he does so then he walks to the door with a sense of dignity he has never had before.
Im not trying to tell you hes Little Lord Fauntleroy.
Sixtoed cats. Assyrians. Abyssinians. Its the same difference. Well dont think this Terry Malloy is any sixtoed cockeyed Assyrian. Hes a bum. Charley and Johnny Friendly owned him when he was a fighter and when they ring the bell he still goes into action.
You think we kept you out in Tarrytown just to have you go walkin with a corner saloon hoodlum like Terry Malloy? Now get back to Tarrytown before I put a strap to you.
Whats the matter? Ive got something Thats chokin me. Ive gotta get it out.
But youre the one I want to tell what you said over Nolan about keepin silent when you know the score Im guilty you hear me? Im guilty... .
Its like carrying a monkey around on your back.
Conscience... .  I didnt even know I had one until I met you and Edie... this conscience stuff can drive you nuts.
This is my business.
Take your hands off me. What you call me?
Who asked him here?
You all right Nolan?
You still call it ratting?
What do you think?
And I still say you stand up and Ill stand up with you.
So help me God
Didnt I see you fight in the Garden one night three or four years ago? With a fellow called Wilson?
I think you could have.
I ought to belt you one J.P.
Better.
A cheeseeater  Youre kidding
You ought to go home and take care of that
Hey Skins  get away with that sheet metal all right?
I I was just on my way up Johnny.
Nothing happened he says. Some operator you got yourself there Charley. One more like him and well all be wearing striped pajamas.
Shes off limits for bums like you. Leave her alone.
Yeah yeah Heres half a buck go have yourself a ball.
Listen Nolan
Leave her alone you fiend
If I could get my hands on you...
But does it have to be in a cemetery?
Im getting the jitters Lets turn back
Not dead?  In a cemetery?
What do you mean?
What can we do?
The ropes are coming loose.
My guess is if we dont take the chance pretty soon were not going to have much life left anyway.
They wouldnt dare put us in the same grave bor would they?b
All right.  Put it on heavy.
...And what is this?
Oh yes a religion of sorts.
The moon is almost gone
Your pleasures of course
You may take her now.
Its not often an Emperor like iyoui calls on creatures like us.
I could make her another Cleopatra...
What happened to Mandrake the Magician?
I want to speak with you please.
You were ibothi in the trunk?  Together?
But you know what Im talking about dont you?  About Glenn dont you and the second car?
He didnt hurt you or anything did he?
You didnt visit him in prison.
But you spoke to him on the phone.
Ask him his name.
Im not dressed.
We may as well leave her were leaving the car and we gotta leave her some place anyway whats the difference where?
Jesus Christ what were you doing in there?
Do we need him?
I know exactly what you mean.  Its just a feeling.  You know I could go for some wine tonight.
Is that Snoopy?  In the purple doo rag?
You didnt tell your sister about Ripley did you?  Cause I dont wanna go through that again.
I mean they dont know for sure hes dead.  Look theres always a chance well walk outve there with nothing.  I say let fate decide.
They put a gun on you youll go back.
And she saw you?
You find out?
Ill make you a deal.  Get out of here. Right now.  Ill do the job with the Snoop meet you wherever you want and give you half.
They look like plain old rocks.
From the looks of those boys the Ripper too.
We made it didnt we?
No you dump the van meet me at the airport. Ill take one of Ripleys cars.
You talked to him?
Foley made me think of that fella Carl Tillman the one you were seeing it turns out the same time he was doing banks.  You recall that?
Yeah but I had enough reason to believe he did and I told you.  So you had to at least suspect him.
Take the radio stay down here in the lobby watch the elevator.
Now you see Foley and this guy Bragg come in behind us whatta you do?
Leave it where it is.
Im a federal marshal and youre under arrest.  Put the gun on the table.  I mean now.
Who?
Other than we had so much fun the last time we worked together.  You gonna tell me why youre comin to me instead of the FBI?
Yeah and as you can see home invasions are big too.
Thats fine but I dont want you to talk to Miller alone.
This doesnt concern you Foley.  Why dont you go on out to the yard have yourself a smoke?
Jack you dont use a gun do you?
There isnt any.  All this shit you got in here.  What is all this stuff anyway?  Handcuffs chains... whats this can?
Wheres your gun your pistol?
Guys like me huh.  Well listen even though Ive been celibate lately Im not gonna force myself on you.  Ive never done that in my life.
You dont act like it.
Oh you mean of Bonnie and Clyde?  Hm. You ever see pictures of him the way he wore his hat?  You could tell he had that dontgiveashit air about him.
That part in the movie where they get shot?  Warren Beatty and... I cant think of her name.
And the guy saying he wasnt gonna take any more shit from anybody...
Something Ive been wondering what ever happened to your Uncle Cully?
Unless you wanna tell me.
Dont leave me.
If I had answered what were you gonna say?
You kept touching me feeling my thigh.
I hear he didnt mean to.  The cop fell as Dillinger was aiming at his leg and got him through the heart.
No youre right.  Or Buddy.  I wont ask if hes with you or what youre doing here in Detroit.  Or if youve run into Glenn Michaels yet.
Youre not dumb.
You guys come on this is too heavy
Take your sunglasses off.
Wait in the car.
Looks like tonight.
Tell me something.  Whats it like walk in a bank with a gun stick it up?
I know what youre talking about.
Yeah but whos gonna believe Glenn? I mean do uyouu believe Glenn?
Have they got Midge up there?
We thought it might be her husband. Sometimes he comes and checks up on her.  She told him I was down in Florida.
You busted out?
There were others.
You must be some kinda walker Henry.
Ill send it to you at Glades.
I got a big score lined up up north. They wouldnt even know about it it wasnt for me.  I could do it right now myself except its so fucking cold up there in January
Look I can understand if you and Foley are close.
But you say he hasnt shown up you think he backed out?
You there?
Watch the road boy.  I like this Town Car.  We can cruise the mans neighbourhood without getting the police or private security people on our ass.
Wait a minute.  Im letting iyoui in on this not all your friends.
Its all right with you Ill just hang in the car.
I can tell.
Here?  In this house?
Well ihei aint even here that much.  I like to know where he goes but at the same time I dont iwanti to know you understand?
Technically.  Theyre separated.
Can we change the subject?
He doesnt even look like that.
Remember pay attention to how she talks about Foley her tone.  Do it right shell tell you things she wouldnt tell Burdon.  Tell her you think hes a nice guy.  No first tell her about being in the trunk with him in the dark for half an hour and see how she takes it.  If shes in on it what does she get for all the aggravation cops breathing on her?  I bet nothing.  So she still likes him enough to stick her neck out.  You think thats possible?  What kind of guy is he?
You gonna go get him?
You here all by yourself?
In case no one knows what he does. Tell me Ray you ever wear one says Undercover?
I think its Dunn  uBradustreet.  But then I could be wrong...
Excuse me.  Snoopy?  Did we settle the fish thing?
Now listen its hands off Billy.  I mean you can put your hands on him if you want to but then my hands will break yours.
I wish she could forget him.
Nervous?
Youll love it.  No base no bars just lots of sun and aircraft maintenance.
What lizard?
Shit hes puking on my feet
Danny I dont like this fuckin guy.
Bandits at 2 oclock.
Good shooting Danny
How could you do this?
Dont make this a joke Rafe.  Youre talking about war and I know what war does to people.
Didnt you say you told her not to come?
Then why are you looking for her?
Yeah right.  Anyway you didnt know.
Im saying now you do know.  So its time for you to fuck off.
Dont blame her Rafe.  Its not like youre thinking.
Theyre all over us
I got a half a tank.  You?
Fun today.  Like old times.
What do you mean?  Im just doing what weve always done.
Its shorter than our practice runway.
Hey  What is this the planes all bunched up like that?
I taught him to drink beer.  He taught me how to fly.
That might not have been such a good idea.  Theyre making us fly out of a halfpaved airfield.  The real punishment is that I wont be back to the barracks till its too late for dinner or coffee. So I guess its goodbye for awhile.
Thats bullshit son.  But its really good bullshit.
In flight school you qualified in single and in multiengine planes.  Youll be flying multiengines here.
How often you fight like this?
Theres one thing I have to say.  Im going away.
I sent telegrams I guess the military traffic held them up.
Set up teams of radio operators to send out messages the Americans will intercept concerning every potential American target in the Pacific.  Include Hawaii  the clutter will be more confusing that way.
We have achieved surprise but their carriers are not in port.  I dont like this.
We have bombed Tokyo Mr. President. Radio Tokyo interrupted its own broadcast to make the announcement.
Hello Lilla
Quite a bit more rain than usual this year. I hope it doesnt spoil the rhubarb.

Mom lots of people are separated and divorced.
You just have to remember... men are like houses and trade upwards... I thought you had a pretty good marriage.

Are you taking Janet to the reunion tonight?
I vant to suck your blood. I also vant to suck your Twinkie.
How could you forget? We talk about seeing other people and you forget?
Its not going to be forever. I figure three years is long enough. I can see it the music pans out.  And right after graduation we should start seeing other people. Kind of comparison shop before we settle down and get married. Know what I mean?
Right. I promised my mother.
This is a mistake. We better forget it.
Youre going to blow it Peggy Sue. Nobody treats Charlie Bodell like this.
What about everything I said to you this afternoon...

You know Peggy Sue your mother said you had a dream that I died.
Beths boyfriend is playing in the band.
Dont get your hopes up.
Cool it kids. Hes free to see other girls if he wants.
The only thing my father digs is cold green money. All my mother cares about is her standing at the country club.
You think so?
I dont see the humor in this. Go to your room immediately. Youre grounded.
Thank God for that.
All right. But this better be good.
Hi Dad.
Quiet today?
Yes.
Hell win.
A new car. We cant afford a new car.

Charlies downstairs. Why arent you ready?
And the butter.
Mom sit down for a minute. This is so nice all of us being together again like this.
You think thisll cheer Dad up?
I remember when you got that locket too. You were so excited I think you showed it to the whole school.
I spend three hours a day practicing. I have trainers I know what Im doing.
Are you Peggy Sue Kelcher?
Hello. Nice to meet you. Please call me Peggy. Im Peggy Bodell now.
The only time people like Dolores used to pay any attention to me was to laugh at me or insult me. That guy Doug Snell who shook my hand when we walked in he used to call me a foureyed worm.

And when lawyers break the law when this society loses respect for the law when that day comes our cherished institutions will be burned to the ground and our children and grandchildren will live like savages.

You didnt think so then.
Geiger counter?

Its no use ... there she goes.
Gone.
Air leak. Died in her sleep.
Apart from that you look pretty chipper for a man whos two thousand and thirty one years old.  I read the clocks. They bear out Hassleins hypothesis. Weve been away from Earth for two thousand years give or take a decade.  Still cant accept it huh?
Because time has wiped out everyone and everything you cared for  theyre dust.

You destroyed his memory His mind His identity And you want to do the same to me
Let it be clear at the outset that all matters pertaining to this inquiry are confidential and anyone discussing them outside this chamber will be held in contempt of the Tribunal.  You may proceed Dr. Honorius.
Thats a lie

There is no contradiction between faith and science. True science.

Suppose I hadnt known that immigration inspector? Hadnt put in a good word for you?
Whats the matter?
We have some nice places around Vancouver.
Well how about a breeze up to the penthouse about six oclock?  A friend of mine is throwing a cocktail party up there.
Nobody gets invited to Clark Brandons parties. They just go.
Dont I even get my face slapped?
Whats the matter baby? Dont you like being kissed?
Well... they have to service the plane... and get a pilot down to the field unless theres one hanging around there still... and then they have to get the immigration officer...
They might think I was running away from something.
A fellow named Brandon has a penthouse here. Hes holding open house. I was up there. Too noisy. Bored.
There isnt one.. That anyone would believe. I went for a walk after dinner down to the ocean...alone... I came up and went to bed. I didnt sleep very well. Then there was a thunderstorm. And it began to rain. I went across to close the French door. Thats the first time I saw him out there.
Bad?
What time is it?
Cold?
That man over there. He was in the hotel lobby.
Quite sure you saw him in the hotel lobby?
Theyre going to arrest me.
If you meant it you wouldnt show it to me Betty.  Or am I supposed to deliver it to dear Inspector Killaine?
Theres a lot of water between Vancouver and the U.S.A. This note is a suicide note.  After youre gone where would they look for you?  Why would they look for you? Darkness and open water and a fast cabin cruiser.  And I have a pocket full of money.  And if I helped you Id be committing a crime or so they tell me.
Take me where I havent the courage to take myself.
Blonde beautiful and sadand nowhere.  Of course she might have run awayif she knew how.  And where to go.  She might have dyed her hair.  Bleached it before probably.  And changed her name again.  But look at this note.  And look at her room in the hotel. Her stuff is all there.  Hasnt a rag except what she stood up in. You dont run away like that.  Not if you are young and beautiful. No chance.
If youre doing all this just for me.
It wasnt the time or place.  Dont worry about the note baby.  Im playing for my neck now.
Would I want to?
Yes Miss.
Sorry Miss. Beer and ale only. Canadian law.
Beer or ale Miss?
Im sorry.
FLorida?
Down belows Stanley Park. On the other side of the trees theres a beach. You can see it.  Stevestons over there. Coast Guard station.  Theres the Yacht Club and beyond it the docks. The over on the other side of the inlet theres Grouse Mountain. Its about 4000 feet high. Theres a restaurant on top of it. Very nice restaurant.  Im sorry we couldnt have met in pleasanter circumstances Miss Mayfield.
Were 98 per cent certain Mitchell was murdered. There are a lot of reasons.  Was he very drunk when you last saw him?
I wouldnt make you talk about it. My job is the death of Marry Mitchell.  Why cant you give me your confidence?

This isnt a very good place to talk.

But I tell youif youd only understand.
And theres a Mr. Goble to see you. Says his business is personal.
What have you got on Miss Mayfield?
You hurt my feelings. I ought to raise the price to be a thousand.
I go home and paint the kitchen.
Sorry. Another client paid for that. You can hire me not to use it.
Hi Margo. Hello Killaine. You two come together?
You make friends quickly dont you Clark?
And without much discrimination.
How are your teeth getting along?
Whats this in favor of?
Thats what I like about cocktail parties. Everyone is so perfectly natural.
How about a cup of coffee?
How are you two getting along?
I would.  Fancy waking up every morning with that in your lap.  Wonderful thing money is.  Remember what Somerset Maugham said about it ?
I have a warrant for her arrest.
Ive always thought you were a pretty nice guy Brandon.  Id like to go on thinking so.  If you tried to help her get away
Information.
Not if she knew she wouldnt be believed.
You do a lot of real estate trading Brandon?
I tried it once.  I lost my shirt.
I had a father who knew how to steal.
Want to walk out... or get thrown out?
Good afternoon Mr. Campbell.
Im getting positively haggard. In a couple of years people will be describing me as well preserved.
So much less refined than frizzling them in the chair.
What do you want?
So he didbut he hasnt told you what he saw. I have.
One of these days youre going to wake up in the middle of the night and find that youve cut your throat.
The Harbor police have just picked up a dead man out of the water.
You have two murders to investigate. This mans head was beaten in. And theres nothing in his pockets.
I got through to Greer his partner in the detective business.  Greer wont give out.
Send that?
The Supers just given me the sweetest dressing down Ive ever had.  Im still reeling from it. And believe me I had it coming. I apologize.  What you think is importantI think is important.
Im looking for Mr. Brandon.
Itll be a tough dollar when guys like you learn the alphabet.
Right.
Not too hard is it?
Youve got a dead man on your hands. You killed jimeven if it wasnt murder.  What are you going to do about it?
No suicide.
Scotch and plain water I think.
You knew Mitchell pretty well didnt you Mrs. West?
You couldnt possible have traced it this soonnot possibly.
Yes I think so.  Here are two glazed manila envelopes.  One is the bag type.  The other one had the money in it.  Dont ask me how I know.  I know.
He checks too.
This gun permit was issued to Clark Brandon?
No.
Which forces me to arrest her against my better judgment.
Are you a policeman or a softheaded nincompoop?
Soso.
Rich? I havent the faintest idea. Why?
I dont. My hunch is shes just torn up an unhappy marriage. I was able to do her a small favor.
Whats this?
Its against the law to cross the border with a gun. The Canadian police might like to know about this.
I told you shes just..
Mr. Penfield.  I am sorry to have kept you.
My first husband worked for the BBC.  I doubt if anyone there remembers him now just another long dead diligent administrator. He would have been useful in the fight to preserve the BBCs independence during the Suez crisis  one of the few things he was passionate about.  I became involved too.  I started work on a book that would have been published on the tenth anniversary of Suez. Then he died and I loots the will to write it.  By the time I was over his death other books had been published and it wasnt worth going on.
I see.  Are you a socialist Mr. Penfield?
Since you are a friend of my daughters I think Im entitled to call you James dont you think?
To Ann.
Its a pity she couldnt make it up here today.
But Im not an interviewer or a correspondent.
Hows Mary?
Would you like a dessert...Im having one.
James... I cant begin to tell you how pleased we all are.  Congratulations and I really mean it.
So its all worked out perfectly...
What did you think of that Wadja film?
Good theory.  But I like my mother. I have no aversions to what she does.
Everyone describes the same process. At first it is exciting.  Youre at the centre of the world.  As soon as anything happens youre the first to know about it.  And there are deadlines a dozen times a day even more and thats intimidating and exciting.  Then you get the hang of it and the excitement wears off.  Your a clerk in a rather dowdy Office.  Theres none of the glamour of television or the penetration of serious journalism.  Youre a processor of semiofficial news.  Some people leave at this stage.  Then if you hang on and especially if youre promoted you discover a new kind of pleasure.  Youre pleased by the ease with which you can write summaries and bulletins from news agency printouts by the way you ca judge length.  Ending a broadcast on the dot having everything run smoothly selecting a running order that makes sense knowing instinctively what you can and cannot do.  Professionalism.
I might see you in Norfolk over the weekend.
...an innocent interest and found out that last year Vogue ran a series called Mothers and Daughters Number seven Anne and Susan Barrington.  Being a decent loving friend I went to the files and made a copy for you.
Six onion bajees  Great girl.  Did you shake the mother off?
What period?
Wait...and with talks at the United Nations still making little progress tension and anxiety settled on MPs of all parties in Westminster.  Speaking on the Jimmy Young Show earlier today Mrs Thatcher said the prospects of a peaceful solution did not look encouraging.  What is it?
Ive got to be going.  Ive got a meeting tonight.
Susan told me that your visits to Norfolk had ... well an ulterior motive.
Youre so famous now.

Mmm.  A lawyer huh?  Too bad.  But at least youre surfing now.  So your lifes not over yet right?

Whats this?
You gotta tell me where she is.
Why should I?
Pretty radical Johnny.  Even for you.  Why dont you pull it?

What do you want?
Gimme a break.  One shrimp and fries to go  Anything to drink?
What is it?  You all of a sudden got this bug you had to go surfing? This is a line right?
Nice place.
Meaning you were expendable.
Look at you.
Well usually you have this sort of intense scowl of concentration like youre doing this for a school project or something... I dont know like somethings driving you.  See its gone.  If I didnt know better Id say you looked almost happy.
Those are cold.

Thanks.
You lift off in three hours.  Theres one other thing.

Theres no way you could know that.
Hey big guy you getting tired yet?  I am.  This is Vivian.  You two been together long?  You and Edward?
Its... its not like that.
You dont know anything about me.
The real estate possibilities are endless.  Most of the yard well just level.  I talked to a couple of developers under the table of course and they said 
I... I would take advantage of it.
Mind if I turn on some heat?
Very good.  Youre obviously mechanical.
So do day jobs.
Ugly habit biting your nails.
Youre joking.

Hello?
You liked the guy though.

I thought maybe youd like dinner.
Youre really pushing it bringing me here.
Ive been with stinking old men whove made me want to puke but Ive never had anyone make me feel as dirty as you did tonight.
Can we talk about this?  Can you just try to calm down?
Pay me  Before I pick up this chair and smash your face in.
Edward I cant.
What if I lose it?
You dont want to go all the way to San Francisco in a limousine do you?  I dont.
Sorry.  Youre not paying me to ask you question like that.
If youd gone on about how much you liked it Im not sure Id have believed you.
Last time I saw him he was this strong guy.  Now hes beaten. And you uliked himu.
Right.
Why do guys always know how to hit a woman?  Right across the cheek wham so it feels like your eye is gonna explode.  What do they do take you all aside in high school and show you how? It pisses me off
I got tired of hating my father.
Youre packing.
Barnard Thomas manager of the hotel.

Brides often are Im told.
Who are you?
To think  all that time it was your cup that was poisoned.
He knows I do not love him.
Rest Highness.
You mock my pain
Faithfulness he talked of madam. Your enduring faithfulness. Now tell me truly. When you found out he was gone did you get engaged to your prince that same hour or did you wait a whole week out of respect for the dead?
Death cannot stop true love. All it can do is delay it for a while.
Singed a bit were you?
At a time like this thats all you can think to say? Gently?
Oh Westley will you ever forgive me?
Look are you just fiddling around with me or what?
No more rhymes now I mean it.

But if there can be no arrangement then we are at an impasse.
Yes.
Really? In that case I challenge you to a battle of wits.
Inhale this but do not touch.

Nothing.  Just... all the lights out... must be asleep.
I wonder if well ever see Mary again.
I wonder so many things about her now.  Why she never told me about you...  Funny when you think theres an answer to everything you think you know all the answers.
I suppose... when you were able to marry her shed have presented you all shiny and proper... she always tried to be proper.
Sorry.
What?
Yes.  But maybe this proves that Bates found out about the money.
Its regular. Okay?
Call your boss and tell him youre taking the rest of the afternoon off. Its Friday anyway... and hot.
You sure talk like a girl whos been married.

And Im a working man Were a regular workingclass tragedy

They thought shed be coming to me.
Everyone concerned thought... if they could get her to give back the money... they could avoid involving her with the police.

Hey what do you think youre doing? Put that stuff back
Im through clowning. Youre all washed up. Get out
You cannot. Im still editor of this sheet.

Your dad has stood for plenty. Now lets get down to cases. When did you see the Dale girl last?
Hmmm. Why didnt you tell that to the police?
Now look here. Its not up to us to do our own detective work. Ive had enough trouble over this matter. I dont want anything more to do with it.

But I have some friends waiting.

Yep. Everything settled.
Well any time I can do anything for you 
A place youve never been.
Why am I doing this?

Dysfunctional 
Theyre filthy Mother.
I know Mother.
I am in awe of it Mother.
Hey Rose did you hear about that terrible thing down in Cave Springs?
Promise not to tell Doll?  or nobody? Buddy its your Daddy Im so much in love with him I am out of my mind
Hmmm its soft. Its awful soft.
Well I thought they were more like a cantaloupe.
Theres some kind of gristle in it though.
Actually I am though.
All right thats enough.  Youre just a child and wouldnt understand it but that type of thing can stir a girl up. Now lie back and well talk.
There aint none in your Daddy. You know what happened has just made me love him all the more. I not only love him I respect him I admire him.
Most men wouldnt do what he done. If they can get a girl they go right ahead and get her  I guess to hell they do just like a dern rabbit. Course later theyll tell her shes no good when they done the same thing their selves. Theyre a bunch of monkeys. I like em but theyre a bunch of monkeys.
Of course you cant Im... Im shocked at you Buddy real shocked Now you be quiet or Im going back to my own bed
No. No youre not hurting me.  But I think you better quit it.
Rose are you all right? Are you sick or something?
Rose you must know who the fellow is.
Oh hes so kind so gentle inside and so unhappy with that rich wife who doesnt understand him her being a Southerner and everything and what a bedside manner he has got  so gentle and kind beneath the professor way he acts
Yeah he tried to hide it but I saw em and a little bit he says to me You know you are beautiful. Now wasnt that a nice thing for a doctor to say to a patient wasnt it? What could cheer a girl up more?
Oh Buddy theyre gonna cut me all up Theyre gonna cut my stummick all open Ill die
I gotta find out what theyre saying. You lie back and rest Rose and Ill give you a report on it.
Children children Be quiet all of you  The vibrations in this house are strange today. Wheres Rose anyhow?
There goes Mother.
He kissed her.
Shes putting the titty back.
Whats goin on?
Well you rascal whered you come from?
How could that be son?
What sad news? Did her cancer come back?
Is her husband sick or something?
But... but how? She was young Rose wasnt old
I cant believe it Daddy. I know it must be true but I cant believe it.
Well its a disaster. I dont know what to say Doctor I am floored. How dangerous is the operation?
Of course.
Good morning sweetheart. Beautiful day.
Just halfacup of coffee. I never eat darlin you know that. Not eating and reverse insomnia are my curses. Lets go Rose you and Brother lets hit the road.
That is exactly what Im afraid of.  The girl has got to go darlin.
Honey Dr. Martinson isnt a rascal hes one of the finest physicians in Glenville. He studied at Johns Hopkins University.
It has been three weeks since I fired her. Is there no way to get rid of this girl? Are we stuck with her for life?
She does look a little peaky.
Honey Rose was born on a farm and has terrible memories of farm life. Now I dont think 
This is a total catastrastroke. As of this moment I am stumped I admit I am stumped and treed both the hound dogs have me surrounded.
Youre not going to get anywhere with that line of questioning. The problem is what are we going to do?
Well thank God we are rid of her at last. And the best thing of all is that shes happy. The little nut is happy she found Mr. Right in the nick of time
Yes sir.
Ahhhem Now Rose get off my lap. What are you doing girl? Are you crazy?
Thats a pretty stylish skirt Rose. The only thing I dont understand is how did you ever get it on.
What have you got in your hair girl?
Where do you want me to let you out Rose?
All right thanks to her and thanks to this case of epizootics you are getting another chance.  But dont try my patience again. We have growing children in this house. Do you understand me?
Well I know it I just got the bill for it.
Umm. Well. Yes. But no more strange voices in the night Rose.
I didnt mean to bite him. He was hitting Horton with a blackjack in the meanest way and... and I bit him accidental.
There aint nobody here Mr. Hillyer Honest there aint
Well it was a silly question.
Well Rose going out to look for a job today?
Well I have got news I called long distance and spoke to Cousin Hop and youll be glad to know Rose I have found you a job
Im not cryin because of me Im cryin because of somebody else.
Yes Mr. Hillyer I am.
Galley what?
I dont mean that the way it sounds.  Imagine it a book. And I used to know you personal way back when.  Tell me something Buddy how do you dream up all that stuff?
Heh heh heh heh same old Buddy always jokin around. Almost as much of a joker as your Daddy.  I saw your Daddy a coupla years ago I was up in Glenville lookin at a motel site. I guess thats where youre headed huh to see him?
I see. Outside it.
Umm well...
Yes dear what is it?
Well Mrs. Hillyer the girl is strong as an ox and that is what is keeping her alive. But not many people walk away from double pneumonia Madam not many.
Its simply that I find it incredible Mr. Hillyer. Aside from the girls illness at the moment she is very strong a very healthy specimen of a young human female  and a comely one too. She must have gotten protein somewhere as a young child if only sporadically.
I will not cry like a woman. If Im upset its because of what my husband said not because of you. You cant make me cry like a woman a woman has got just as much intelligence and selfcontrol as a man. And you get this in your head. If you hurt that girl Ill hire lawyers and sue you for malpractice for every penny you have got Ill do my level best to ruin you. Do you understand me?
I understand you perfectly. You leave that girl alone you wretched man or you will be sorry.
Oh no maam.
It must be wonderful to be so smart. I dont see how you do it reading all those books learning all that stuff.
Well you run on now.
Yes Maam.
Never again never again...
Well I... I... I dont know... maybe it was... but no you cant be sure about a thing like that. It wasnt Billy I didnt know him.
Rose you dont have to.
Youll never guess what happened  I have met Mr. Right I been with him all day and he loves me I know he does he loves me and hes going to marry met Bes practicly ast me already
I... I can explain...
Hasnt he got enough problems or didnt you notice thats not cream soda on his breath?
You think its that good?
A Lincoln?  What Lincoln?  Lincoln Continental?  Lincoln Mark Five... Six... ?
Take her down to the car and for Christs sake be careful this time.  Last suspect he took in butterfingers dropped her down the stairs.  What a mess.  Why is it we dont appreciate our arms and legs till weve lost the use of them?
Kittle...
Last time BillyBoy did this the guys neck broke...  ... just like that.  Sad in a way. Why is it we dont truly appreciate our arms and legs till weve lost the use of them?
Whatd I say?
You shouldnt litter.
Give a Hoot.  Dont Pollute.
Just a little you know... Bicentennial memento.  Nothing special.
Sons of bitches
I can work this.
I say fuck em.  Lets go.
A.D.
Wh... what... ?
It doesnt say that.
Laugh it up.  Youll cry later.
Where we going?
Who said it was me hub?  Anyway... he fell off a ladder.  It wasnt really my fault.
You live like a pig.
You plan on shooting that gun or just hugging it?
What about Jack Daniels?  Wasnt he a decorated general in the Civil War?
He tried to kill us.
You fuckers... damn you  Why?  Why me?  Why the obsession with me?
Look out  Jupiter and Saturnll get you every fucking time.
I just think you should show some respect.  I mean call me old fashioned but 200 years ago when Ben Franklin and those guys signed the Constitution and Declaration of Independence they did that so we could all share in the freedom...
If they crash maybe hell run.  You can shoot him in the leg or something.
Thats right white bread.  Give it up.  Right now.
What... ?  Not you too?
If it is thats pretty high up on the totem pole.  What do you think?
Howd we do?
Were screwed.
This shit was Ming.
We saw it. All craft prepare to retreat.
I cant do it Artoo. I cant go on alone.
I cant do it Ben.
To be a Jedi Luke you must confront and then go beyond the dark side  the side your father couldnt get past. Impatience is the easiest door  for you like your father. Only your father was seduced by what he found on the other side of the door and you have held firm. Youre no longer so reckless now Luke. You are strong and patient. And now you must face Darth Vader again
Shhh. You have hibernation sickness.
The Death Star will be completed on schedule.
I told you to remain on the command ship.
They are clear my Master.
Youre gonna die here you know. Convenient.
Luke.
Now we find out if that code is worth the price we paid.
Shall we try and go around?
Han Hurry The fleet will be here any moment.
The codes changed. We need Artoo
Chewie Chewie give me the gun. Dont move Lando.
Well look at you a general huh?
Look. I want you to take her. I mean it. Take her. You need all the help you can get. Shes the fastest ship in the fleet.
What are you telling them?
Proper?
I tell you this station will be operational as planned.
But he asks the impossible. I need more men.
Oh Oh my. Uh Princess Leia
What do you remember?
Tell me.
Luke dont talk that way. You have a power II dont understand and could never have.
No you dont. Youve always been strong.
You dont know the power of the dark side. I must obey my master.
If that is your destiny.
ObiWan has taught you well.
You cannot hide forever Luke.
Sister So...you have a twin sister. Your feelings have now betrayed her too. ObiWan was wise to hide her from me. Now his failure is complete. If you will not turn to the dark side then perhaps she will.
You
I see.  So this wasnt simply a chance meeting.  You came here with a purpose.
The future is ours so lets plan it.
Oh Janet
Oh Brad Im mad.
Yes the rain has been very heavy.
Oh....Say something.
Right
Hello.
Yes well perhaps it was for the best.
You beast you monster what have you done with Brad?
Ssssh.  Brads probably asleep by now. Do you want him to see you like this?
What a guy
What guy
Want to come again and stay

If you had asked anyone who knows boxing they never wouldve predicted a first round knockdown and the second round punishment to the body of the Champion... Most fighters will tell you receiving a good body punch is the next worst thing to dying.
Without a doubt this is the most punishing brawl I have ever seen  The ringside audience is spotted with blood. This fight should have been stopped rounds ago but Rocky Balboa refuses to fall 
Honest to God Im broke  Gimme a break.

We dont serve formula. Snookums.
My problem is I come here to drink in peace.  So if you dont mind...
And another thing the paper said no will was found.  But every Toon knows Acme had a will and in it he promised to leave Toontown to the Toons.
The papers said the safe door was opened Eddie.
So youre not even gonna bother to find out if the rabbits gettin framed?

Are you always this funny or only on days when youre wanted for murder?
Yeah.  I think Maroon plays the part of the sound mind your wife the sound body.
How do you know that?
But thats my calling my purpose my raison detre.  Toons are supposed to make people laugh... and believe me those people needed a laugh.
A laugh can be a powerful thing Eddie. Sometimes its the only weapon we have in life.
Hey doesnt the rabbit even get a last request?
Valiant and Valiant?  Whos the other Valiant?
You damn Toon  No wonder they picked you for the patsy.  Always gotta play the fool.  You make me sick
Gee Eddie youre not gonna go are ya?  Maroonll be layin for ya at nine oclock.

I think you oughta read it to her.
Pretty good cigar.  Whered you get it?
Boo Ah ha ha. Ooh. Boo Ha ha ha.
If she is well then nothing can be ill. Her body rests in Capels monument and her immortal part with the angels lives. I saw her laid low. Pardon me for bringing these ill news.

Why then O brawling love O loving hate O anything of nothing first create. heavy lightness. Serious vanity. Misshapen chaos of well seeming forms.
Out of her favour where I am in love.
Then she hath sworn that she will still live chaste?
Every man betake him to his legs.
Forbear this outrage good Mercutio.
Uncle tis a shame.
It strains me past the compass of my wits.
Young son it argues a distemperd head so soon to bid good marrow to thy bed or if not so so then here I hit it right our Romeo hath not seen his bed tonight.
Holy Saint Francis what a change is here Is Rosaline that thou didst love so dear so soon forsaken? Young mens love then lies not truly in their hearts but in their eyes.
I thought thy disposition better tempered Thy Juliet is alive. There art thou happy. The law that threatened death becomes thy friend and turns it to exile. There art thou happy. A Pack of blessings light upon thy back. Wherefore railest thou on thy birth the heaven and earth? Since birth and heaven and earth all three do meet in thee at once.
O God. Did Romeos hand shed Tybalts blood? O serpent heart hid with a flowering face. Was ever book containing such vile matters so fairly bound? O that deceit should dwell in such a gorgeous palace.
Thou hast a careful father child One who to put thee from thy heaviness hath sorted out a sudden day of joy that thou expects nor I looked not for.
Marry my child next Thursday Morn. The gallant young and noble gentleman Sir Paris at Saint Peters Church shall make thee there a joyful bride.
Within Juliet
O honey nurse what news? Nurse?
How art thou out of breath when thou hast breath To say to me that thou art out of breath? Is the news good or bad? answer to that
I have.
And from my soul too. Else beshrew them both.
She speaks O speak again bright angel
Thou knowst the mask of night is on my face Else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek For that which thou hast heard me speak tonight Fain would I dwell on form fain fain deny What I have spoke but farewell compliment Dost thou love me? I know thou wilt say Ay And I will take thy word yet if thou swearst Thou mayst prove false. O gentle Romeo If thou dost love pronounce it faithfully
Do not swear although I joy in thee I have no joy of this contract tonight It is too rash too unadvised too sudden Too like the lightning which doth cease to be Ere one can say It lightens. Sweet good night This bud of love by summers ripening breath May prove a beauteous flower when next we meet. Good night.
A thousand times the worse to want thy light. Love goes toward love as schoolboys from their books But love from love toward school with heavy looks.
Come gentle night. Come loving blackbrowned night give me my Romeo. And when I shall die take him and cut him out into little stars and he will make the face of heaven so fine that all the world will be in love with night and pay no worship to the garish sun. O I have bought the mansion of love but not possessed and though I am sold not yet enjoyed. O tedious is this day as the night before some festival to an impatient child that hath new robes and may not wear them.
It is It is Hie hence be gone away.  O now be gone. More light and light it grows.
Nurse give leave awhile We must talk in secret. Nurse come back again I have rememberd me thous hear our counsel. Nurse Thou knowst my daughters of a pretty age.
Why may one ask?
And so did I.
Meaning to courtsy.
I will follow you.
Good king of cats nothing but one of your nine lives.
Do you have it?
Of course.
Only the stupid ones.  Cigarettes kill more patriots than bullets.  Besides Im not IRA no more.
You call me with the targets route I follow along until weve reached the attack point and then I run his squag ass off the road.
What is?
And whats that supposed to mean Seamus Reilly?
Do I need to repeat myself?
I still am.
And when I consider that I have to wonder if you dont have some ulterior motive for being here with me right now.
Who are you?  IRA?
Its quite satifactory.
Wheres the case?
And more importantly 
What am I doing here?  Why Im here to see my partners Gregor the boys in the Russian Mafia.  See your bosses had hoped to screw me by hiring you to pull your thieving double cross.  But they only just found out that whats in the briefcase is completely useless without me.  I cant fight them and they cant kill me  that means were gonna have to do business together.
Sent it where?
Gregor is that you?
It was a mistake it shouldnt have happened.
A means to an end is that it?
Hello JeanPierre.
So what is it you want to know?
The point remains we could be working for different people.  Theres a chance for one of us...  Maybe more than one of us  has been paid to cross the others.  I dont know about you guys but I like to know who Im working for.  It can help prevent a great deal of...  ...unpleasantness.
Its been known to happen.
After we stop the target car I get out and use the heavy artillery to kill the driver and his bodyguard.
I dont particularly like killing tubby but I want you to know that this one Im going to enjoy.
Cigarette?
Where to?
Pretty much what youd expect.
Exactly.  Why not bring them?
Whats going on?
You know what you pulled back there that was bullshit.
How did you know?
Youre a cop...youre a fucking cop...I should kill you.
Continue when it would be so much easier to give it up.
Do we need anything else?
Not here.  They might see it.
The mark of a true Samurai.  What I do for the Company Vincent is no different than what you do.  Were both hired guns and this is a job  like any other job.
Lets get him out of here...
Your field dressing saved his life. Thats three I owe you.
Tell me something first.  The package what was it?
Whats the story?
Why didnt you kill her?
I was wondering if you had any movies that were particularly new.
Seamus Reilly boys a serious Irish Auteur  a real firebrand.  Thinks his more moderate filmmaking brethren have turned to making movies for peaceloving pussies if you see what Im saying.
Whatsamatter with you?  Arent you concerned about all of this?
Ready to roll partner?
How old is Otis anyhow thirty?
All right hold on  Lemme think...  Shit did you touch the car?
Ive got one condition.
I dont know  Son of a bitch Who the hell are you?
Thats not what I mean.
He would have done it to us right?
Well Im not  Thinks hes got us by the balls.
And how do you figure we do that?
Youre out of your mind.
You think hes bluffing?
Its gonna be o.k.
I dont know for sure but why else would they head for the bank?
I understand your logic Booth but I dont think...two thousands going to raise any eyebrows do you?
Well I dont know whats going to happen next  shes pressing this another interrogation another problem.
You dont expect us to believe that do you?
How are ya?
Well not that I wouldnt sugar bun but Earls in a bind.  Theyre going to take his car.
Get a room in a nice hotel for a few hours...
Whats wrong?
You got me something?  Whats the occasion?
What happened to your cheek? SALLY Oh I...nothing...
And Id end up a widow in two ways.  Lets forget it.  Ill just be a little more careful next time.
Wed... I dont know...go to California New York maybe a house on a Swiss mountainside...
I dont know Booth.
Why does that bother you?
Sally theres a whole world out there.  We can have a new home. A real home not some tinplated dump.  What are you giving up?
Things just got a little screwed up thats all.
Sally do you love me?
Be more specific.  A month a week...
Test the product?
Business is business.  Now where the hell is it?  I wanna get out of here.  Thats the plan were just flunkies you know what Im saying?
What is this?  Dont be stupid man...
All right deputies take care dont let your meat loaf.
Yeah.  I told him Id be there before five.
Dwayne...  It is imperative that we keep this confidential.Now we know someones out there.  Very close. It may even be the son of a bitch that killed my partner.
OK...this is good.  Our first solid lead.
Some of it.  Denning only handled a small portion of the total but it looks like this was one of his bills.
Anything I can help you with?
I have an anniversary coming up thought Id buy her something special.
Yeah she is.  She comes up to about here on me.
A lot of men come in here?
No.  But what I would like is the forty dollars you owe me and Im a busy man.
Aw now thats gonna take time to clear
Do you even have a girlfriend Jesse?
Wheres the hot back  the therapeutic pad thing?
Ill settle for a third of that.
Oh Jesus Christ...
Dont hurt me.
Thank you honey.  are you sure you dont want it?
That fire was set.  Deliberately. And probably not by anyone found at the scene.
I dont know how else youd explain it.  The coroners estimated time of death for everyone there was long before this fire started unless of course Denning started it and that doesnt make much sense.
You think he skipped town?
You assumed a brother coming in here can only afford fivehundred dollars a roll is that right?  Are you a racist?
Winner six
Invitation please.
Hear you got your ass kicked in Hong Kong James.
Howd you know?
So tell me what you know.
What?
How you doing baby?  My name is Prince Mubutu from Nigeria.
San Juan  You must know my good friend Pedro Martinez Hernandez Hector Elizondo.
Red Dragon?  You sure about that?
Look Ive been working this case for months now...
Howre they getting into the U.S. Mint to use the presses?
You bring American money?
Thats what Im talking about.  A real Hong Kong night club.  You want an Altoid?
Ill meet you at the bar in ten minutes. They dont like tourists in here so try to blend in.
Carter get off that stage
Carter you dont understand.  These men are FuCangLong Triads.  Part of the most deadly gang in China.
Whatd I say?
Hello.
Goddamn you got a small ass.
Where are you going?
Not Yu.  You
What leave you alone so he can cap you?
What are you gonna do about it grasshopper?
I heard your mama pulls a rickshaw.
Who?
Maybe.  But not like Asians.  We never panic.
Yeah thats definitely the woman from Ricky Tans boat and shes staying in his suite at his hotel I told you this would work out.  They still just talking?
Hell be back soon.
My fiancee left me over the summer  a month before our wedding.
No.  It was my singing.
Shes just standing around  not doing much.
Im gonna go in the hall and get a bucket of ice.  You want some ice?
No.  Its not right.
Whats she doing?
I dont want to hear this.
Wait a sec  what the hell is that between her legs?
I wouldnt do that
Secret Service Agent Carter.  This is my calling Lee. Give me six months and Ill be in Washington protecting a white guy.
If she was the right girl youd be thinking about her.
How was the sex?
Steamed dumplings?
Thats rough man.  If I dont get steamed dumplings once a week I go crazy.
As long as youre asking...I think you have a pretty good voice.
Benjamin Franklin he discovered electricity.
You could never kick my ass.  You mamas boy.
Ricky Tan is alive.
You go after Ricky.  I got this.
What is this?
They owe us man.  Thats the least they can do.
First class.
I dont know if the FuCangLong paid you to get rid of Tan or whether it was a pure vendetta killing  but youre off this case.  I dont ever want to see you again you got that?
You move well.
The Secret Service almost busted Reign at his casino in Macao but the place burned down before we could move in.
Im asking for real now  will you help the Secret Service?
Master Ching taught me.
Lee there was a bombing at the American Embassy.  Two American translators were killed.
... if your father were alive I would be turning to him now.  I didnt blow up the American Embassy but I believe some of my people did.  My enemies are trying to frame me.  There is a war going on within the Triads  and I am going to lose.  My name has been written into the book of death.
Youre just like your father Lee.  All these years hiding behind his badge.  I wanted to help him to share with him but he was too afraid of change.  When you think about it I didnt really kill him.  I just put him out of his misery.
I need your help Master.  Im seeking a man who used to train with you.  Hes become a killer  the worst kind of animal.
A seeding spends its entire life reaching towards Heaven.
The answers you seek can be found in Heaven on Earth.
Chin you have been ordered by the Ministry of Public Security to assist the FBI and Secret Service with our investigation to provide us with whatever we need.  If you have information it belongs to us.
Carter.  I just want to be able to tell the Ambassador who was responsible for the death of his daughter because he talked too much.
What you did was dangerous and completely outside policy.
Ooo theres a chill.  Love that.
You talk very fast.
Bullshit a little.  You lied to me.
Its the same thing
 what the hell is that?
I could not come.  I had other responsibilities.
I also did not come because I think I would not fit in America.
When we go inside you let me handle everything you hear?  This is my man you dig?  My informant. You know what an informant is?
Thats not how it goes.
No no.  Its not goodGod you all Its GoodGod yall.  Yall
Not yeeaw Yall.  And its gotta be angry.  Like youre pissed off.
Are you OK?
Want some?
What?
OK when you go in just act like youre from outa town.
Oh no.
Oh my god. Griffin.
Yeah...beautiful. What would you call that paper there? Kind of a...Robin egg blue color?
Well.. I wouldnt want to be in the way.
Yeah if youre Superfly.
Any demands yet?
What the hell am I supposed to do with him? Take him to the zoo?
Oh yeah.  The caller was a man. Confident.  Had an accent.  My guess Asian.  Anything else I can do for the FBI sir?
I oughta pat your ass down.  Make sure youre not a cop.
Okay look were gonna make a trade. You cross the street leave her on the sidewalk.  I will leave him on this side.  Then we trade places.  You get him I get her.  Get the picture Lois?
Youre movin to death row. See your fingerprints are now on the murder weapon of Four FBI Agents. And when I turn this into the lab theyre gonna find Lafontaine all over it. And we already know...  ...this is your MO.
Where do we find him?
Yes.
I am not an American Mr. Russ.  My daughter is not an American.
I am so sorry about your men.
I will not have friends in America.
You dont understand this guy.
At this pace it could be an evening wedding.
What do you expect me to say to this?
You look awful.
Really?
Im really sorry that I hurt you Brian.
Tell me why does Maggie need another wedding rehearsal and two days before the wedding?  Shes already done this.
Fully.  I like her.  She has wit.
 Its for you Ike.
Maggie
Or a vegetarian?
No... Theyre interesting guys.  Each one of these guys has something going for him.  I mean ones been up Everest. Anothers become a priest.  Ones a pretty good guitar player.  And this guy today tried to end world hunger if you can believe that...
No.  I call it like I see it.  Im a journalist.  Im a truth teller.
Hello.  Im looking for Maggie Carpenter.  There was a sign at the hardware store across the street...
About her upcoming wedding and all.
Yes I am.  And who are you?
Oh Betty.  I take it youre going to be making the wedding cake and they say youre throwing 
Well instead of a haircut how about a wash?  You know get all that city grit out of it.
Give me that
Look look man.  I think the man is heartbroken.
Too much.
Im a work in progress.
I dont know.
Your filters clogged.  This takes unleaded.
No.  But I think attraction is too often mistaken for rightness. Attraction is very misleading.  And if its mutual its well terribly distracting.
That was very interesting research George was doing
Every one of those times I was being supportive.  Something you wont understand.
Okay.  So... what uh... What just happened?  Just now?  Jus then?  In there?
Yes you
Ive been making friends with your cat.  Is it okay that Im here?
Livid is good.  So what is it Maggie? You here on business?  I saw your lamps. Theyre terrific.
You actually could make breaking and entering into a new career.  So what are you doing here?
You were not.
Im listening.
Thats what he says but if he thinks that I dont realize hes writing another article then hes an idiot.
I know.  I think sometimes you just sort of spazout with random excess flirtation energy and it just lands on anything male that moves.
Because you think Im all like... Hey man check me out.
But you havent lost your mystery Youre very mysterious
Im not worried about you and Cory or Cory and me or even that youre irreversibly screwed up.  But Maggie youve been like this since we were kids.  And I think now that you are aware of it and that it hurts peoples feelings maybe its time to move on with your life and commit to someone of your own like Bob if hes the one.
Grandma
Hes not coming.  Watch.  Hes not coming.
What are you talking about?
You know its just possible that she hasnt read this yet.
The short one with black hair is your cousin Irene 
Harold who ran away with his secretary but came back 
They loved you.  I told you they would love you and they did.
Even when you were young?
You sure you dont want to drive with me?
When you get back Ill be gone 
Dont hate me but I love this pattern.
Im not at the top of the Empire State Building.  Im here.
Its not true but it feels true.
Whats with you?
Oh? Oh really? Now were getting down to it.
It sounds like the name of a mattress store 
What?
On top of the Empire State Building at sunset on Valentines Day.
You want to hear about destiny? If my husband hadnt gone on a diet which caused me to leave him I would never have been on that flight to Miami and met Rick and ended up having sex in the bathroom of a 727 with that nob you slide that says vacantoccupied vacant occupied vacantoccupied  
I thought I would look into doing a story about those radio shows.
What?
I love you too.
But he saw you right?
You dont know who she was Annie 
This is a photo of hair.
Becky?
I need to know about him because... hes involved with my sister...
No I know that part 
No no no its more like who is he does he have a sense of humor is he nice  no forget nice Ive got nice 
Ill tell you the truth I heard this guy on a callin radio show and I might not marry the person I should marry because Ive become obsessed with him.
I mean why did you get married? Was it all fireworks and trumpets and 
I know I know.  I do not want to move to Seattle.  But what I really dont want to do is end up always wondering what might have happened and knowing I could have done something. What do you think?  Its just cold feet isnt it? Everyone panics before they get married didnt you?
Its probably just the flowers 
Oh please.  Destinys just something weve invented because we cant stand the fact that everything that happens is accidental.
You know.
Magic.  It was magic.
Of course it took several years before everything worked like clockwork in that department so dont be worried if it takes a while 
You touch her for the first time and suddenly... youre home.  Its almost like...
Hello.
Im not mad at you.  Okay Im not mad at you.
Its been about a year and a half.
Weve been talking to  well lets just call him Sleepless in Seattle and well be right back after this break with listener response uyouru response to the things weve been discussing.  The number to call is...
No last names Jonah.  Hello there you sound younger than our usual callers.  How come youre up so late?
Is he home right now?
Just because someones looking for a nice guy doesnt make them desperate.
It is not 
Do you know how much it costs to go to New York?
I can hear you walking around sometimes.  At first I thought it was a robber.  Go ahead tell her Dad.
What?
What?
Dear Sleepless in Seattle I am an SWF  What is that?
But not dinner necessarily on the first date because by the time youre halfway through dinner you might be sorry you asked them to dinner whereas if its just a drink if you like them you can always ask them for dinner but if you dont you can go home if you see what I mean.  I wonder if it still works this way.
If you get a new wife I guess youll have sex with her huh?
It was sinking.
Our house.  There was water coming in all the windows.
I figure we could go to New York catch the Knicks and since wed be there anyway obviously wed go to the Empire State Building 
Did you call that radio station again?
Everyone at work heard you.
Did too.
Yes?
God its wonderful to see you. Wheres Greg?
You saw her in the airport and then here?
Anyway Victorias nice.
Oh.
I read an article about this ...
I told you it would happen. Its bound to happen when a man works alone
Are you going to let us pass  or do I have to call the Sheriff?
Not so sure about that. Letter of the Law you know. All the injunction says is no picketing by miners.
He says give em equality. Equality in jobs equality in the home. Also sex equality.
Supers busy  with your Negotiatin Committee.
Now wait a minute. Supers the one made the rule. He aint gonna give you no helper.
To the mine?
Come on Esperanza  how about it? We got to.
He cant drink this milk. Itll make him sick. Hes on a formula.  I was a fool I shouldnt have kept him with me.
We cant get everything at once. Right now weve got more important demands.
First we got to get equality on the job. Then well work on these other things. Leave it to the men.
Esperanza have you forgotten what it was like before the union came?  When Estella was a baby and we couldnt even afford a doctor when she got sick? It was for our families We met in graveyards to build that union
Is that all you care about? That radio? Cant you think of anything except yourself?
Was it expensive the beer?
Forgive me ... for saying you never thought of me.
Whats the matter?
A fighter huh?
Mustve been some experience for you huh?
I guess you got enough today to last a lifetime huh?
Im telling you. I dont stay home with these kids tomorrow.
How do you feel?
Where are you going?
When?
You mean youre ready to give up?
No you dont. Have you learned nothing from this strike? Why are you afraid to have me at your side? Do you still think you can have dignity only if I have none?
Dont horse me. Price of zincs never been higher. They dont want no strike  not with their war boom on.
Go on. Spill it.
No. New York.
What are you doing here?  Something wrong with Mama?
Wheres your mama?
Papa cant I leave now? Theres a meeting of the Junior Shop Stewards ...
But youve got me doing everything. Mama never used to make me dry the ...
Ramn ... listen for the love of God ...
You got a bathroom I can use before we hit the road?
Bobby?
What can I do for you?
Yeah but he was in silhouette.
Look...Id like to help you out ... but I really dont want to get involved.
Jesus I look like a raccoon.
What about the guy on the very bottom?
Oh hes a keeper all right.
Go ahead.
You dont understand.
Why dont you call the cops?
Turns out Im allergic to steeltoed boots. Go figure.  By the way Im not looking for a matching set.  Wheres Quincey?
What do you want from me Colette?
There you go again. Youre nothing but false notes.
What are you hiding Danny?
Im kind of busy.
We been through that.
No youre wrong I tried to tell myself the same thing but I could have gotten up. I could have done something.
How you holding up?
Im genuinely happy that you found some peace Nancy. But you cant forgive for Liz.  No one can.  And you cant forgive for me.
I dont buy that. Theres a place for hatred.  Did you know that Liz and I got into an argument the night she was killed? I acted like an ass and I never had a chance to apologize to her.  Do you know what that feels like?
How the hell did we get this detail?
Where to?
Was.  Im on the fucking ghost train right now man.  You got anything for me?
What?
I think so.  I mean wed have to talk to him.
Why do they call him PoohBear?
Youre going to have to explain that one.
What does J.F.K. stand for?
Whats this?
What the hell is that?
What?
But... why? Why would you pretend?
I dont know... a little. I wish you would have let me in on it from the beginning.
Wouldnt be a favor if you were paying me. Ill just take my five when the deal is done.
Im gonna get this developed and send it to the Warren Commission.
Yeah I uh have a buyer whos looking for about a quarters worth.
Can we talk price?
I dont know 14000 a kilo?
Okay ... How about um .. 6000 a ounce.
You want to do this some other time?
Captain Steubing thinks you might work for the police.
This is bullshit.  You didnt say anything about anybody else being here.
You dont find that repugnant?
I met the guy at a party.  He said he wanted to do a biggie. Hes new in town so I offered my services.
Did you really think you were slick enough to pull this off?
Bullshit. Hes a liar.
Guy scores dope and dollar from ripping off other drug dealers.  As least thats what the word is.
What? Is it bad?
Danny?
This the guy?
Turns out hes connected.
The Mexicali Boys
He knows somebody ratted him.
Fuck you Garcetti. I been at this for almost a year. Ive done everything you guys have asked of me.
Hes the only one I told.
Sounds like you hooked up with some fine citizens Flynne.
Excuse me?
Why doesnt Palmdale P.D. just raid the guy?
Were coordinating with Palmdale P.D.. Well have your sorry ass covered.
When is the deal going down?
You mean like the Donner Party?
Tom quit fucking around.
You think thats a good idea?
And believe me word will get out that youre a pro rat.
Were in business.
What is that? Rum and coke?
Jesus Jimmy you at the alpha team.
Yes sir.
Pinned down a mile east of here waiting for some help from the navy guns.
Sir?
A private sir?
But sir...I...I...
Good luck John.
In the back of a nineteen and thirty one stretch Hudson with a big ole trailer.
Yep.
No ones gonna win the money for the simple reason that the Captain never was a civilian.  They assembled him at O.C.S. out of spare body parts from dead G.I.s.  I know this for a fact.
He aint Wade.
Well Ill be goddamned I knew it.
Where?
What the hells the matter with you Jackson?
Sir I understand what youre doin but I respectfully request permission to grieve in my own manner.
Sir I understand.  I dont like it but I understand.
How about that jeep?
That only leaves three.
Id like to stay too Captain.
I can tell what the gunners had for dinner.
Upham youve got to learn the difference between whining and griping.  You cant just rely on natural ability youve got to study and practice.
You ever going to open those letters? Miller keeps his eyes on the maps.
Its not normal not reading letters from home.
You think theyll be alright?
Yeah?  What rule of thumb is that?
SHOVES THE NEEDLE into Wades neck. Thick vein.  Pumps the morphine straight to Wades brain.  Motions impatiently to Sarge.
You alright?
You know why Im such a good officer? Because of my mother.  Have I ever told you about her?
No problem.  A pair of deuces?  Less? So what?  I bluff.  It used to tear me apart when Id get one of my men killed but what was I supposed to do?  Break down in front of the ones who were standing there waiting for me to tell them what to do?  Of course not so I bluffed and after a while I started to fall for my own bluff. It was great it made everything so much easier.  Sarge Is that why your hands been shaking?
Oh yeah?
John Ive got to tell you I think youre about used up.
What are we going to do?
Captain can I put in for a transfer?
Sir what if they send some other company into Caen ahead of us while were pinned down here?
Sorry I need a B.A.R. man youre the best.
Captain can I ask you a question?
Id much rather die in Caen than Ramelle sir.  Its a personal thing.
Well maybe not the Captain but the rest of us have mothers.
Any further thoughts on the subject?
B  Ryan is dead.  Hes been blown up by the German equivalent of Wade whose name I know you dont want me to mention.  Theres nothing to find. The biggest piece is the size of a pea.  We wander around looking for him until the Germans pick us off one after another.
Neither do I sir.  C  And this is the worst one we find Ryan and hes wounded.  Not only does he not carry my gear we have to carry his gear. And him.
Looks like theyve been having a hell of a party here Captain.
Leave him to me Captain Ill have him pissing and moaning with the best of us.
What deal?
FIRES a burst.  Germans drops.
Doesnt move.  He just stares at Sarges body.
Oh Christ now we gotta listen to that grandfather thing again.
Who cares?
But everybodys heard of him he won the Congressional Medal of Honor he saved a dozen men.
Sir I ran the 220 in high school.
On guard glancing back.  Pissed off.
Demolition right?
How fast?
Im supposed to be leaving on a fellowship that I worked for my entire life.  I dont even care.  I met this boy over the summer and I I cant see him because of this I cant talk to him I cant talk to my father about... I wore these clothes I thought I thought that if I looked right and if I acted right then someone would talk to me.  But I look awful and I feel awful could you could you please talk to me?  Be a little decent.
This evening is over.
No Im not married.  Its for my daughter.
Thanks I like yours too.
Cmon just do it.
Alright.
What does it say?
Trapped in the body of a gameshow hostess.
Hey I know this is a strange thing to say but maybe Diane Court really likes Lloyd.
Ill put this past my boss
No wait a minute.  Everybody thinks youre what?
God Ill have to go on a plane.
Morning honey.
You bet you should have called.  You still live at home.  Dont make me call the police at threethirty in the morning dont make me call hospitals.
But listen if I had a friend in the same position I would tell her to delay a year.
Dad you and I have talked about this.  Lloyd and I have talked about this.  Believe me this is wellcovered territory.
Sweetheart no.  Dont be ridiculous.
Alright alright.  Go ahead.  When Im old give me someone like me but go ahead.
Why are you being so hateful to me?  Is this because of Lloyd?
Hello.
Mom please?
This is me telling you about me.
If they ask you questions and they probably will ask you questions would you please say something nice about him mum? Help him?
You will?
Yeah.  I read about your fellowship in the paper and Im very glad you called me back.
Yeah.
Well...
Alright.  This is really great.  Alright were going out. Its a date.  Its a scam.  Whatever whatever alright Ill pick you up at what eight O clock?
Eight. Eight O clock.
So its an honor?
So we can finally talk?
Thankyou.
Nobody knew me before tonight.
Sure I do.
Thanks.  But either way it still feels...
Oh.
Me?  Sure I do.
I think thats ageism and thats thats being prejudiced against people because theyre old.  Maybe their mouths dont work as well as yours.
Yes.
Yeah.  With potential.
If youll just maybe ease it into second.
Yeah a little bit.  Listen this is important.  When you feel it start to give put the clutch in.
I dont know.  Im happy.
It did?
Ive never sent a letter like that you know?  I mean I felt like I wanted to tell you something but I didnt put it in the letter and I didnt say it but I want to say it now Im not sure if I should say it you know cause people always say it and dont mean it but I think that I mean it so um I just wanted to tell you...
I feel like a dick.  You must think Im a dick.
Yeah you do.
You shared it with a dick.
You told your dad?
Then dont do it.
You do?
Hurt me again?  Not a chance dont worry about it.
Im fine.
Okay.
Youre freaking out here man.
No my brother you have to go buy your own.
PAIN
The guy with the Datsun?
The truck?
Why dont I just get your phone number thats usually how it works.
What?
How ya doing?  Is she around?
Yeah Lloyd.  What are your plans for the future?
Seriously Lloyd.
Joe.  Joe.  Shes written sixtyfive songs.  Theyre all about you.  Theyre all about pain.
My car.
Dont make this like a counsel Lloyd. I got statistics I can show you I got graphs I can show you.  Thats all the stuff I can show you it all says the same thing.  You have to decide on a career.
Ooop excuse me.
I was gonna...
You know every year I throw this party every year nobody helps me clear up.  Why am I yelling?
I dont know.  Good on you man.  Alright Lloyd.
Certainly.
I love you man
Oskar  my friend Lena.
Now youre back.
Well lets find him.
The gentleman thinks a mistakes been made.
You know what youd like her.
Its not a charade all this?
Your friend Amon Goeth has been arrested.
There are some things that are unclear. We need to talk.
Do you have any idea whats involved? The paperwork alone?  Forget you got to build it all getting the fucking permits thats enough to drive you crazy.  Then the engineers show up.  They stand around and they argue about drainage  Im telling you youll want to shoot somebody Ive been through it I know.
You held back Stern.  You held back the one man most important to my business.
What do you want for him Ill give it to you.
You took my workers.
When?
What are you Moses?  What is this? Wheres the money in this?  Whats the scam?
Youre not telling me something.
This is not my problem.
What do I got for you?
You have any idea what a shirt like this costs?
Whats wrong with it?
Oh God you dont have a drink?
What was that about the SS the rate the ... ?
This I dont know maybe you can trade it for something.
I got to go Ill see you.
I know what youre saying but I dont see the difference.
If Id made more money ...I threw away so much money you have no idea. If Id just ...
Whats he done thats so bad  take money? Thats a crime?  Come on what are we here for to fight a war?  Were here to make money all of us.
We know that son.
Were going to bring her in. Hide her out for a coupla days. And were issuing a campus lockin this evening. No one is allowed out after dark.
That shit. He only calls you when hes drunk. Dont go over there.
Dont. Think Bailey.
Kill kill kill kill hah hah hah hah...
Hang up...call...
Why do you always answer a question with a question?
WHAAAATT?
I dont think thats a good idea.
How? What could I say that would make a difference? I took away a year of your lifehow do I apologize for that?
It helped me realize one thing.
I get my revenge and make some fast cash.
Look Im sorry about the face.
Fair enough.
Well you know Im dear to the subject matter.
Hi Gale any leads?
What are you going to do?
But youll never get away with it.
No way.
Its okay. I can peddle toilet paper.
Lemme take you home.
This is exactly what I dont want.
I dont really know what happened in Woodsboro Sid. But I know you dont trust me.
Two.
He sent me the cutest email.
Youre the one who got away.
Of course not. Who wants to? Whats the point if we dont get caught? Wheres the glamour in that?
..so we had to be different but yet the same because if you venture to far away from your orginal story you completely alienate the audience...
We had to have financing.
Ive been trying to reach you but you havent returned...
Yes Miss Weathers your name is embedded clearly between my ears.
You have every right to be upset.
I never meant to imply...
Youre a hard one to figure out. GALE Its that complex yet shallow quality. Its deliberate.
If you were truly a copycat wouldnt you want to emulate everything about the killer that you could?
Hes already gotta be a part of Sids life. What do you know about this Derek?
You broke my heart.
And its sexier in the dark.
This is all too familiar.
Lets go.
Look Sid why dont you take off? Disappear for a few days. Ill come with you.
You go its all stairs I can take it from here.
It seems to be causing a stir. Whats with the toilet paper?
Youre going to get it. You know what happens.
Okay youre sure about skipping Calculas?
No girletta I dont leave your side.
Its okay to break girl. You shatter if you have to.
Im the only one who can cut him down.
Randy Meeks.  He was with Sid that night in Woodsboro.
Ill stop by the Deltas tonight.
Sid Ill seeya tonight.
Its all about sisterhood. Everybody thinks its about partying and blowjobs but...
Hello?
Take it off.
You ass.
Ill be right back.
What do you want?
Do you work for her now?
Oh thats right. Those poor poor people. God Ben Damon was such a hottie.
What do you mean?
I dont watch TV and I hate books. Whatta you need?
Jesus Christ you scared the shit out of me.
Well I interviewed Damon once for the show. He was a real obnoxious fuck. Any way the second one Christine Perkins she had a part in Stab 2 didnt she? She was playing CICI.
Ive tried to get in touch with Sidney Prescott but shes keeping herself very well hidden. Youre my one and only hope in finding her. Her life may be in grave danger.
Oh. I thought you wanted me to stick around.
Please call me Gale.
Whoever it is now is taking credit for Maureen Prescotts murder.
Must be exciting Beautiful place beautiful people.
What do you mean?
Ghosts are tough  you cant shoot ghosts.
Thats fine Mr. Rielly but if anyone else should die Im going to have to get a warrant.
Before you jump to conclusions the man in the picture COTTON WEARY is out of the country on business. His alibi checks out. Seems hes got a TV show in Australia 100 COTTON. Its supposedly the biggest thing down under since Yahoo Serious but thats besides the point.
Is that a threat Detective?
Detective Kincaid?
Sidney do you have any idea how he couldve gotten your number?
Jesus Christ Sidney what happened? I got a call on my cell from home. They told me that someone was attacked.
I was afraid they were bait something to ya know  trick you out of hiding.
Alright Sid over there is the STAB 3 Production offices. Thats where Sarah Darling was murdered last night.
Do you really mean it this time Gale?
Two months ago the Woodsboro police got a call from a woman who said she was with Stab 3.  She wanted to see the file on Sid for research.
The boys said no.  She wouldnt give her name. A month later the station gets broken into the file room ransacked.
Dont worry. Im prepared for anything.
Ive got an idea Ill hook up with you guys later.
Well its a honor to be here amongst so many fans of the genre. And I must say that any of you worried that Jerry Rapp or Tori or David not returning to complete the STAB trilogy have no fear Roman is here. Aided with my excellent cast of newcomers I believe were going to pull off one of the best Stabs yet.
Would you excuse me for a moment?
Geez.
Rob Reiner and Quentin Tarentino?
Just because you knew her?
But you know my favorite name?
What are you talking about? The murders were a completely isolated incident.
Roman and everybody else went home for the night. Im here for a makeup test.
Do you think its over Sidney? Do you?
I want to finish what I started. I want to finish the game.
If you lay a hand on him Ill fucking kill you
 a click  I only her you too Sidney.
Hello?
No I need to call you. Just you.
Howd you do?
Dude. What are you doing here?
You have to play Sid. Dont want to disappoint your dad. Hes been waiting around all night.
What if your father snapped? Your moms anniversary set him off and he went on a murder spree killing everyone...
You rode your bike out there?
Billy? What the...
Close call.
No... I dont... its just... Oh God Billy someone was there someone tried to kill me.
I think in some weird analytical psychological bullshit way Im scared Im gonna turn out just like her you know? Like the bad seed or something...
You heard me.
Its called GUESS HOW IM GOING TO DIE
I dont understand...
I dont know.
Uh... HALLOWEEN. You know the one with the guy with the white mask who just sorta walks around and stalks the baby sitters. Whats yours?
I have to go now.
Nah I dont think so...
Whats his name?
...please... no...
...leave me alone... please...
Hi Gale Weathers. Field Correspondent INSIDE STORY.
Productive. So theyre closing down the school?
I just turned 25. I was 24 for a whole year.
Keeping an eye on things. Checking the place out.
A car was spotted in the bushes a little ways up the road.
What are you doing here?
Does mom know?
What did Mama tell you? When I wear this badge you treat me like a man of the law.
No Dewey. Youll ruin the whole night.
Should I be worried?
Its Deputy Riley today Sid.
I was first to respond.
Shes tough.
Hold off for now. Just stay close to her.
Where is she?
Casey? Where are you honey? Call the police goddamnit.
Where is she?
If Im gonna blow this up  I need hard proof.
Im not here to fight.
I think you falsely identified him. Yes.
Not one word. He admits to having sex with your mother but thats all.
Where do you get this shit?
Aha Randy you gave yourself away. Are you calling from work? Tatums on her way over.
I like that thing youre doing with your voice Randy. Its sexy.
Are you alone in the house?
Can you see me right now?
Good try Randy. Tell Tatum to hurry. Bye now.
Looks like you fingered the wrong guy... again.
Have a good trip.
I thought Blockbuster fired you.
And are the police aware you dated the victim?
You coming tonight?
So whats his reason?
Shes saving herself for you.
We could be like two grief stricken students and well say really nice things about our good friends who were slaughtered senselessly.
Yeah.
If Tatum sees you  shell draw blood.
Guess I wont be needing this anymore.
Not anymore. Her parents found her hanging from a tree. Her insides on the outside.
Fucking clueless  theyre interrogating the entire school. Teachers students staff janitors...
Uhhuh its just... you know the police and reporters... it brings it all back.
Its okay. She was supposed to pick me up.
Do you really think Billy did it?
It was just some sick fuck having a laugh.
This could be good. What do you think Sid?
What do you think about when youre having sex?
No way.
TATUM
You dont.  It goes to court now.
There are seven deadly sins.  Gluttony wrath greed...
Whats this Im declining this case?  It dont work that way.
Come on.  What are you going to do with yourself out there?
Did you read in the paper today about the man who was walking his dog?  he was attacked and his wallet and his watch were taken.  And then while he was still lying unconscious his attacker stabbed him with a knife in both eyes.  It happened four blocks from here.
Well there he sits.  Its not supposed to make sense.
This guy paid me five hundred bucks to bring it out here.  He wanted it here at exactly seven oclock.
I dont believe it.
What time is it?
Give me the gun.
Where we headed?
What makes you so special that people should pay attention?
I hate to burst your bubble but other than the fact that youre especially sadistic theres nothing unusual about these precious murders of yours.
I... I doubt I enjoyed it any more than... Detective Mills would enjoy some time alone with me in a room without windows.  Isnt that true?  How happy would it make you to hurt me with impunity?
You wouldnt because you know there are consequences.  Its in those eyes of yours though... nothing wrong with a man taking pleasure in his work.  I wont deny my own personal desire to turn each sin against the sinner.  I only took their sins to logical conclusions.
You should be thanking me.
And I remember breaking your nose.  Youre only alive because I didnt kill you.
I... I dont follow.
Its very simple.  You worked a nice quiet town but you fought to get here as if your life depended on it.  Ive just never seen it done that way before Detective.
The badge in my pocket says detective same as yours.
Its too soon for him.
Its a package deal.  You get the phone with the office.
Well?
Youve never seen The Odd Couple?  This is sick.  The Honeymooners?
The leather chair was soaked through with sweat.
No fingerprints?
What the fuck is that?
He just may be nuts enough.
All we do is pick up the pieces.  We take all the evidence and all the pictures and samples.  We write everything down and note what time things happened...
Does this make it with you?
Never in my twentyfour years knock on wood.  Ive only ever taken my gun out five times with the actual intention of using it.  Never fired it though.  Not once.  You?
I think Hemingway wrote somewhere... I cant remember where but he wrote that in order to live in a place like this you have to have the ability to kill.  I think he meant you truly must be able to do it not just faking it too survive.
Listen to me.  Hes all about playing games.
Hey Freud what brand of bullshit are you shoveling huh?  Right now hes probably dancing around his room in a pair of his mommys panties singing show tunes and rubbing himself with peanut butter...
Sooner or later his lucks goning to run out.
Well hes been right so far hasnt he?
Just realize... this is not some common lunatic.  The type of intestinal fortitude it must take... to keep a man bound for a full year.  To connect tubes to his genitals.  To sever his hand and use it to plant fingerprints.  Hes methodical and exacting and worst of all hes patient.
Flagged books cover every topic the Bureau deems questionable... communism to violent crime.
Yeah.  Some college student whos taking English 101 and just happens to be writing a paper on Twentieth Century Crime.
This is a waste of time.
I know I know... focusing on one little thing.
Wait... just wait.
Think about it...
You stupid son of a...
Hes preaching.
Dont try to focus on things as black and white because youll go blind.  Theres no winning and losing here.
You tell me then... you walk into an apartment and a man has beaten his wife to death or the wife murdered the husband and you have to wash the blood off their children.  You put the killer in jail.  Who won?
Wheres the victory?
What the fuck is wrong with you?  What burnt you out?
Oh youre so much better than everyone right?  No ones worthy of you.
Listen to yourself.  You say the problem with people is they dont care so I dont care about people.  But youre already here.  Youve been here a long time.  So theres a part of you that knows even if everything you say is true none of it matters.
You knew Id say yes.
Because he is John Doe by choice.
You know hes fucking us.
Well... what the fuck man?
If John Does head splits open and a U.F.O. flies out I want you to have expected it.
Throw your gun down now
Tell me its not true.
Im sorry about this Mrs. Gould.  I really am.
Anything... anything missing or different.
Are you absolutely certain?
I was close once.  It just didnt happen.
Perfect example.
I dont know why I asked you to come.
Ive been going to some of the schools looking for work but the conditions here are... horrible.
Oh Tracy... I have to tell you Im not the one to talk to about this.
Why always like this?  Only after the fact... this sudden realization that if you shoot someone or stick a knife in them that person will cease to exist.
Not tonight...Ben put that sword back.
Killed every one  an not for food either...Whyd they do a thing like that?
Youve said that enough...Maybe Lucys dead...maybe theyre both dead...but if I hear it from you again Ill fight ya Mr. Edwards
Whyd they break off?  Was there water in that canyon?
You can forget that...  Wouldnt be legal anyway.
You askin as a Reverend or a Captain Sam?
What good does that do?
What do you know about it?...Whats a quarterbreed Cherokee know about the Comanche trick of sleeping with his best pony tied right beside him...You got as much chance of stampedin their herd as...
You got any more orders Captain?
I didnt give any order to fire
Fight fair son...Use your fists
I didnt UwantU to tell you...but maybe its your right to know.
I say NO
What in...?
Go on Whynt you have your bugler sound the charge while youre at it??
Never mind...Your pa know youre out here?
If theres anything I can do sir...
Why Colonel Greenhill is Colonel Greenhill sir...Commanding Officer Fifth U.S. Cavalry...Im Lieutenant Greenhill sir.
You tell your pa a company of Rangers  all fourteen of em  fully armed an equipped will be in the field by daylight...headin for the south end of the Malapai. If he can catch up with us well an good...
Unntmeah

You help me find her you got your rockin chair...
I beg your pardon?
Yes sir.
All right...but Im givin the orders...You take em or we split up here and now...
Say...What happened to your blanket? Lose it?
Hes agreed to take you on and share the increase from my herd while Im gone...Ill be pushin on tomorrow...
Why?
Shes your nothin...Shes no kin to you at all
Not so funny...if you recollect what Nawyecka means...
Futterman?
When are you goin to learn to keep your mouth shut Come on. Lets get out of here.
You got yourself a UwifeU sonny
Thats the way to train em. Looks like Mrs. Pauleys goin to make you a fine beautiful wife...
Least UTHEYU wont feed any Comanches this winter...Killin buffalos as good as killin Injuns in this country.

Cherryred Tears.

It makes us feel a whole lot better.
Interesting.
So I just heard her cries for help and all that and when I went downstairs there were already those other people there so I just stood around really waiting  you know how people do  and then when your colleagues arrived I came back upstairs. And thats about all I think. I didnt actually see anything useful I dont think.
No nothing sorry.
Of course.

I go to the bluen gold barber shop in Westwood. The guy in the third chairs dynamite... nobody much.
Who were you talking to?
Now listen Jackie Im not jealous of anybody I just cant afford to get caught... off base.
Its very logical its the most logical thing in the world. You wouldnt feel this confined if we could go out with people and have dinner and a little conversation and so forth...
Maybe he ought to go to beauty school. Anyway see you tonight doll okay?
No.
Thats right.

 He came up behind me and I was wiping a dish and he just... lifted up my skirt and you know right there...
Oh. thank you.
Good for you.
 Jackie really shouldnt drink 
Thank you.
Everything okay son?
I think that was farther west in the Sierras.
There were a party of settlers in the covered wagon times.  They got snowbound one winter in the mountains.  They had to resort to cannabilism in order to stay alive.
Can I go to my room and get my fireengine?
Its like I go to sleep and he shows me things but when I wake up I cant remember everything.
Yes.
Not things that anyone can notice but things that people who shine can see.  Just like they can see things that havent happened yet. Well sometimes they can see things that happened a long time ago... I think a lot of things happened right here in this particular hotel  over the years and not all of them was good.
No I aint.
Yeah.
I didnt think it was going to be this big did you?
Can I go to my room and get my fireengine?
Make sure you come right back cause Im going to make lunch soon. Okay?
Red Rum.
Danny.  Danny stop it.  Danny
Mommy...
Mommy... Mommy...
Do you remember when you were brushing your teeth?
Please...
But eh what was the matter with him?
Oh I wouldnt think of it.
Grady?
Yes sir.  I have a wife and eh two daughters sir.
Who?
How?
Its Grady Mr. Torrance.  Delbert Grady.
Just give me one more chance to prove it Mr. Grady.  Thats all I ask.
Id be glad to do that sir.  Oh why dont you call me back in about eh twenty minutes?
Good evening.  Forest Service.
The Torrances are going to take care of the Overlook for us this winter.
Dick if youre ready to do it now I think it would be a good idea if you could show Mrs. Torrance the kitchen while I continue on with Jack.
Beg pardon?
How are things going Mr. Torrance?
Its really nice up here isnt it?
and it will then take me time to get back to where I was understand?
You mean just leave the hotel?
I dont know.
Yes...
Stay away from me
Stay away from me  Please...
Stay away from me.
Stay... stay away
Give me the bat.
Im gonna go now.
Lets see where were we?  Yes.  I was about to explain that eh... our season here runs from oh May 15th to October 30th and then we close down completely until the following May.
Only in a very general way.
...the winters can be fantastically cruel and the basic idea is to...to cope with the very costly damage and depreciation which can occur.  And this consists mainly of running the boiler heating different parts of the hotel on a daily rotating basis repairing damage as it occurs and doing repairs so that the elements cant get a foothold.
How about your wife and son?  How do you think theyll take to it?
I dont believe they did.
The police eh... they thought that it was what the oldtimers used to call cabinfever a kind of claustrophobic reaction which can occur when people are
Well obviously some people can be
Yes very cosy for a family and if you feel like spreading out you have the rest of the hotel to move around in.
As a matter of fact we eh... brought a decorator in from Chicago just last year to refurbish this part of the hotel.
If Father Lowe is an innocent little lamb why hasnt he picked up the telephone and called Constable Haller to tell him Martys sending poisonpen letters?
Would you kids mind telling me how this guy Lowe became a werewolf to begin with?
Can I tell you kids something?
Did he really get his head cut off Dad? Thats what Brady said.
Went shopping. Why?
Please Uncle Al.
Are you all right Marty?
Ive been hearing noises in there.
Theres a saying soandso was better than a poke in the eye with a sharp stick. You ever hear that one?
Whats going on at Owens Uncle Al?
Well... I like it that you always know how to say things Uncle Al.
Dont call me dear boy.
Your moms not around is she?
It goes fast all right and if your mother finds out just how fast Marty I will have a new job. Singing soprano with the Vienna Boys Choir.
I know you dont. But I want this to be our secret. You get that dont you?
Stay near the house for Christs sake someones killing people. I have to be out of my mind to be doing this you know.
Was it a prescription?
No we just got you out here so we could admire your pretty face.
Do you really think that a man who took a rocket in the eye three nights ago could be out mowing his lawn? Hed either be in the hospital... or dead.
Well... its a lot easier to swallow without the hair and the foaming jaws. Also I checked on the otic solution. It was counter brand. No prescription needed.
It could have been anything Marty.
I saw what I saw.
I think hes going to come for me. Not just because I know who he is but because I hurt him. Only I dont think hell try again as Lowe.
I must tell the Cardinal.  I.11 send him a personal letter describing your efforts your bold new fight to keep your little convent alive.
I think I hear it
You know I just might
But Im fearful
And Im tearful
How are you doing.
Come on  stay.  Just a little.  We can talk Ill get a pizza.  Pizza in bed well have fun.  And you still havent told me what happened.  What did she say?
I want us to be together.  Like people. Honest decent people.  In the eyes of God.  Babe today... I went to confession.
What? 
Babe its not me  I love you  Its God
I was good to you You re nothing but notalent garbage Youre a twobit Tramp
This prom is a real drag.
Look at that.  Get a gander.
Hes so dreamy.  Hes like... a Greek god.  Hes the cutest guy here.    Hes boss.  Hes fab.  Hes...
HES SO FINE.
To sell of course.  I hate to say it but were in terrible trouble here at St. Katherines.  We need a new roof the furnace is going and theres no money.
Hold on.
Two days.  An hour or so.
All right I am I know it  All my life Ive just been... upbeat. Optimistic.  Perky.  I cant help it. Even when I was little I remember my mother used to say That child is pure sunshine.  Shell either be a nun  or a stewardess.
What is it Mary?
Hurry Sister
DAMNATION WAS ALL I COULD SEE
Soprano or alto?
We could cut a demo.  Look for a label.
JUST SING
So Bob how long have you been in? St. Ks?
We need experience.
Im getting experience.
Those people are wonderful  Why dont we ever see them in church?
Oh my Lord
I dont want to mess anyone up...
Are you leaving us?
Run  Take off
But what do they want?  Where are we going?
BUT THE LORD CAME TO ME
Christy.  Christy Van Cartier.
St. Annes?
I joined this convent some thirty years ago.  At that time the world knew some measure of peace.  And hope.  Our order was a beacon of hospitality to families to children to a neighborhood filled with promise.  And as the years have passed I have watched that promise destroyed.  Drugs.  Gangs.  Spandex.  And. so I have made this convent an oasis a retreat from horror. And now that horror has invaded these sacred walls.
And all those like you.
How about a robe?  One of those big terry cloth jobs with like embroidery on the pocket.  Guest of St. Katherines
Excused.  Open the cabinet to your left. You will find appropriate attire.
No  No  I cant do this
The Mary is in deference to the Holy Mother the Clarence in honor of Saint Clarence Loyola.  There are three vows that every nun must accept.  The vow of poverty...
Surely you are familiar with this practice Mary Clarence.  Only when our lips are silent can our prayers truly be heard.
Whats wrong with my life?
Deal with it sweet thing.  Its important nowadays.  You just practice at home with a balloon and a banana.
Sometimes its not enough
It never solves anything.
Clearly you have learned nothing. And you present an ongoing threat both to this convent and to yourself.
And on such an occasion I feel a completely traditional program will be best.
Isnt that why we were asked to sing for those Cardinals?
You sent for me?
What?
But  theres so much more to do right here.  And look if its about me I mean Im gone.
You saved my life.
So I dont shop.
Hes a businessman.
When are you gonna get off my case? Have you got a search warrant?  What do you want  cheap thrills?
Right between the eyes  Down and out The guy was gone  I... I couldnt believe it
And if I dont?
Ten flights?
All right  I get the picture  Ill do it  Ill testify
Eddie youve got to get me out of here.
It wasnt my fault  They just showed up.  Its helping the convent.
Really?  Lieutenant?
Youre not... seeing anybody?
I have?
I cant go with you.
They need you?  A bunch of nuns?  For what?  Moral guidance?  Makeup tips?
Jerusalem is a real drag.  Everybody hates me.
Wheres who?
Were looking for Mike.
Get her
I cant see anything in here
Joey?
Look what she did with the choir.  She made us sing beautifully.
Yes Mary Patrick?
Peace on Earth.
Id rather sing than do anything
Well I dont care who she is.  We cant sing without her
But shes been exposed to the underside of life.  She is the underside of life.
But Bishop...
But Bishop surely you realize  this is a most dangerous neighborhood.
Um... I... I did not... no.  Why?
We must be a curious sight to him.
You need to sleep.
It is sacrilege
Only if I repeat them outside this room.  And I will if I must...  Out there for all to hear.  Or... you may speak as planned.  But you tell them you feel compelled to move on to greener pastures.
It is only important what you are. An adulterer...
You are so upset now... and yet you seemed in such good spirits last night.
Just a moment...  Are you saying it is he?
Listen to what you say....
Where are we going?
Are you familiar with magnets?
Thank you.
If the Western Woods are truly the Devils Glen we will see for ourselves.
My father had farm land.  It was the only thing we owned of any value.
Often in such cases property which has gone intestate legally passes to whomever the deceased was indebted to. And who in this town is owed a great many debts?
There is no Masbath here.  My fathers loan papers are missing.
I was getting worried.  Who was it?
What was she doing?
There are no other doors.  This is as far as she could have gone.
What now?  Where is she?
Shes the one who controlled the Horseman isnt she sir?  Sir? 
This is farewell.
What now?
You are horribly oldfashioned arent you?
He has proposed to me twice.
Ive read a great deal about your New York City.  Do be a dear and tell me all about it.  Sounds like an extraordinary place to live a life.
To call a person superstitious is to imply they fear magic but not all magic is black.
You do not disturb me.  Please stay. Having trouble sleeping?
He only appears to be inside the cage.  The point being...
Very well.  But it will only sit gathering dust.
You promised justice.
Why would you do such a thing?
I have misjudged you I think.  I did not imagine you were so cruel.
You falter with your answer because you strive without putting the whole of your heart into it.  Cant you see? Youll bring dignity to the dead even if you have to chop them into little pieces to do it.
What happened to your mother?  Is she still alive?
My God... what has happened?
Ichabod...
Van Ripper.  Can you show where the body lay?
Imagine my surprise finding him on a liason with a common servant.  A girl who had apparently become his secret love.
Go home.
She is guilty.
All right then Ill see yall later. Karl you done a good days work. They right about you. Scooter hes gonna knock you out of a job if youre not careful. Ill see you tomorrow.
Hit aint got no gas in it.
Hey Jerry how its goin. Good to see you. Been a long time.
Well I guess its all good.
... on the third day I washed her. She wasnt very clean. I got all the right spots. She was the first one I ever kept for any length of time you see I get bored easily I have a short attention span. I cant say she enjoyed her stay although the washcloth in her mouth held in place by good duct tape kept any complaints to a minimum. I dont really like people who talk a lot. I like to do the talking. I guess thats why Im so fond of you. Youre so easygoing although I do sense a little tension in you sometimes. By the way how was it out there? Did you have any fun? Make any new acquaintances? Tell me what it was like.
Hell be here in a little while hes takin me to get an ice cream.
Lets go Vaughan.  Frank well be back in a little while. Ill bring you back somethin. Youre foods in the oven warmin over.
Well I wouldnt let it get to you.
I thought I told everybody to get out of my house. That includes cocksuckers and retards. Get off your asses and go.
Leave.
What in the goddamn hell are you doin? Its the middle of the night.
What have you got to be nervous about? Youre a damn kid. You aint got any bills to pay or bidness to run or old lady to stay on your ass all the time.
Now heres the deal. Now that Im gonna throw my entire life away doin what I want to come live here with yall we have to get a few things straight. See Frank me and you mama wouldnt have any problems if it wadnt for you. Wed never have a bad word between us. But since you do exist if Im gonna be here as the head of the household well have to live by my rules. And my rules are you dont speak unless youre spoken to. Stay out of my way and do what a regular kid does. Youre a weird little shit. I dont get you. So wake up. Face what they call reality. Were gonna be a family now. And its my family. Ill be payin the bills so you got me. But I aint your daddy. You just treat me like I am. Im the boss okay. And the other thing is your friend Karl has to go. We cant have a normal family with him livin in the garage and comin in the bedroom at four in the mornin with hammers and shit. See?
Are you sure you can drive? Youve really had a lot of alcohol.
Whats in your bag?
Wheres everbody else? You seen em?  I thought I told you to get the hell moved out of here anyway.
Hey Frank. You shouldnt be coming over here. My parents really dont want you to.
But maybe just for awhile 
Whyd you live there?
Do you like to play football?
Aw come on. Youll like her. Shes real nice. Shell give us somethin if we ask her to. Candy or somethin.
Id like to kill that son of a bitch. I hate him.
Whered you get them flowers?
Im gettin tired of readin for a while.
I was wantin to ask you somethin.
Would you go see her with me? I kind of thought I might take her some flowers like that woman done you.
I kind of like you tellin me what to do and not to do. Just like my daddy. I didnt mind him tellin me. I hate Doyle to tell me what to do. Mama said the only way to ever get away from him is for him to get away from us. That we cant leave him or hell try and hurt her.
And then some people you dont like right off. Its funny.  You know why I want you to play ball with me?
So it died when it come out?
A boy or girl?
You threw it in a trash barrel?
That makes me feel real sad. Couldnt you have done somethin Karl? I would have. I wish I would of had him. Hed be here right now. Livin.
Bible says the same thing about killin others too.
Seems like Doyles wormed his way back in. Mama said hes stayin over tonight and hes talkin about movin in for good. We aint ever gonna be happy. Well always be nervous wont we Karl?
Way to go Karl. We got a touchdown. That was a good lateral man. That was just like the Wishbone.
Yeah I guess.
Maybe you can make more sense out of them than I can. I made you a little old book marker and stuck it in that book on Christmas.
Hey Karl guess what. Mama said you can stay with us. Out in the garage. Our car wont fit in there anyway. Its real neat.
Yeah honey someday everythings gonna be all right.
You walk fast dont you?
Flowers is pretty. Ive always thought that.
Im ye oldest boy name Karl.
I reckon Im gonna have to get used to them lookin at me too.
Well you have to learn. Itll take some time. Dont you know anybody down there to help you out?
Didnt you go to sleep at all Karl? You been sittin there like that all night?
Do they know about you?
Ill be.
Want to sit down? Did you need somethin?
Thank ye.
Was that you? I remember that. I was only three or four but I always heard about it growin up.  They say youre well?
Youre a hell of a boy Frank. Someday youre gonna get all the good things you deserve. And Karl heres gonna get some more biscuits tonight. What do you think about that?
Yeah.
Well thank you hun. Thats real good of you to say. I wouldnt know what to do without him either.
Is that right?  Are you going to be staying here long?
Do you have family here?
Yes sir.
He just got out of the state hospital.
Hes free. His times up. Thats the rules. Hes been treated and reevaluated. He doesnt show any signs any more.
Yes.
And how many people will be attending this birthday party?
Will that be cash or charge?
I thought I recognized you. Youre Paul Benjamin the writer arent you?
And your father? Is he from New York?
What else. Of course what else? And what are you writing about for your thesis?
Not an easy book.
Its been a while. I thought maybe youd be in touch.
What about for you?
Do me a favor will you?
Next time when you want two corned beef sandwiches say Two corned beef sandwiches. When you want two ginger ales say Two ginger ales.
Its simpler thats what. It makes things go faster.
Are you closed?
Looks like someone forgot a camera.
A photographer ...
Id like to see your pictures some day.
Ive never seen anything like it.
Dont be an ass Auggie. Hes trying to make it up to you cant you see that?
Its not a long drive. An hour an hour and a half. Well be back in time for dinner.
Hey man hows it going?
Two right?
You usually get two.
It doesnt have to be true. It just has to be good.
Im all ears.
Which means that she spent her last Christmas with you.
You made her happy. And the camera was stolen anyway. Its not as if the person you took it from really owned it.
What do you mean?
Shit. If you cant share your secrets with your friends what kind of friend are you?
No Im not. I look like shit. And so do you Ruby. You look just awful.  Whats with the patch anyway? Whatd you do with that old blue marble  hock it for a bottle of gin?
All right sugar whats on your mind?
Help huh? And I dont suppose this help has anything to do with money does it?
Our daughter? Is that what you said? Our daughter? I mean you might have a daughter but I sure as hell dont. And even if I did  which I dont  she wouldnt be our daughter.
Stop it already. Just stop all this crap right now.  Was that your idea to call her Felicity?
You werent so lukewarm yourself. At least at first.
A couple of moments Ill grant you that. A second or two snatched from the jaws of eternity.
Still you cant just write her off.
Remember that business venture I was telling you about? Well my tugboat came in. Im flush.
Whats this?
For keeps?
You dont take anything seriously do you?
Ive got to get moving. Terry will bust my chops if Im late. See you in September Auggie.
A little. Not much.
Open it.
To look at the dirty magazines. I can see all the naked women I want and it doesnt cost me a cent.
And what was he doing here in the first place? Thats what I want to know. Whats a man like you messing around with a black boy like Thomas for? Are you some kind of pervert or what?
Let me give you some useful information son. Theres two dollars and fiftyseven cents in that cash register over there  and considering all the time youve put in casing the joint so far you wont make but about fifty cents an hour for all your pains. However you slice it thats a losing proposition.
Five bucks an hour. Thats the going rate isnt it?  Its a quarter past two now. My wifes picking me up at fivethirty so thatll give you about three hours. If you cant finish today you can do the rest tomorrow.
Benefits?
I dont mean to be nosy but I was wondering what happened to your arm.
You named the kid after yourself huh?
I dont like this. I dont like it one bit.
I dont know. Hello Mom. Hello Dad. Something like that.
Thats all right. If I think of something Ill send my butler over to tell you.
East Seventyfourth Street.
Of course. Where else?
I listen on the radio. I can see the games just fine that way.  The world is in your head remember?
Its strange though isnt it? Looking at yourself before you knew who you were.
Is that what you do? Draw pictures?
Jesus do you make a lot of noise. Cant you see Im trying to work?
Im sorry I messed up. Youve been very kind to me ...  But all good things have to come to an end right?
Absolutely. The world is my oyster.  Whatever that means. 
Not a penny not a stitch. Im cool man. 
Where the hell do you think youre going?
Lets not get too idealistic.
Celebrate? What for?
Hey hey. Happy birthday. Why didnt you tell me?
Yes an invitation. I apologize for springing it on you at the last minute but Mr. Benjamin and I are attending a celebration tonight and we would be most pleased if you chose to accompany us.  Isnt that right Mr. Benjamin?
Good thinking.
So you robbed the robbers and now the robbers are after you.
A lot of good it will do you if the Creeper finds you.
So you lost the job. Is that what youre telling me? He just up and fired you?
No wonder he was angry.
Fuck you too you white sonofabitch.
We came here to deliver some clean laundry.
Like it or not Cyrus thats my name. Cole. Just like yours.
I dont know.
Why?  If they could never take title.
Now if you wanted to kill a man. Think youd try boarding against his will and hitting him with a fishing gaff?
So the fishing gaff method wouldnt make sense?
Now the sheriff believed that the D6 battery in Carls well was Carls own spare.  Even though it was too large f...
Compressed air horn most likely. Hope to God some man hears you in that fog.
You mean Miyamoto followed him out there and suckerpunched him?
We hear how Carl...passed away. Only a few hours later.
Because the facts could be misconstrued as murder.
There cant be any wrong in this Ha...
My father cant get our money from the bank.  We have a few dol...
I couldnt say anything.  I just stood there hating her.
Theyre not his neighbor like you are.  He is a husband a father he risked his ulifeu for utheiru country. The same as you.
Well what then sergeant?
And you werent there when the coroner examined the wound.
And replaced it later with the new one.  Thats your inference?
Did you say more?
And since you confess this is all pure guesswork.  What is your expertise sir are you a detective of sorts?
Greedy.
I asked you a question youre writing a tract h...
And I wouldnt blame these good people if they were a mite resent ful.  At a tactic that insults their intelligence.
Mr. Jurgensen.  Did he offer to ubuyu the seven acres from you?
As my wife testified we were considering it.
I see.  Now what happened the day Carl Heine was found?  Before your arrest.
Didnt go anywhere else?  No errands no purchases?  Just straight to the boat.  Thats the truth.
I did.  Boy.
You said three minutes.
Hes looking down.  And hes not thinking bout the man you were yesterday.  Hes proud of the man you are tonight.  Thats what counts.
Thats when he fell.
He figures a perfectly good lantern could get banged around up there.  So he climbs up.  To cut it down.
Maybe Carl picks up something about the freighter on his radio which is now working.  Same report Milholland heard.  And uthatu makes him get the lantern fast.  Before the freighters wake can bang it around.
Then wheres the lantern?  And wheres the knife?
Cigarette?
Sheriff I cant afford not to fish toni...
You wouldnt even see it move.
Sheriff how many batteries and what size did you find on udefendantsu boat?
So the defendant went out fishing for the night with unou spare battery hmmn?
Operating this winch youd rarely operated before doing this awkward job of bringing in a drowned man of 235 pounds...is it upossibleu.  Possible that he struck his head uafteru death. Possible?
Well...
For certain no.
Can I say something here?
The sweep is just routine not even police action.  Id like to see some sort of...meaningful evidence...
Forget it doll.  After all you work here  I work here  and believe you me its nice to have you with the organization.
Wanna see my drivers license?
I beg your pardon.
Upsydaisy.
Pardon me Mr. Bienstock  can I have my flask back?
You girls have seen a brown bag with a white stripe and my initials?
 so the onelegged jockey said  
Its just a little inlay  it doesnt even have to be gold 
Were not?
Youre going to bet my money on a dog?
Well that solves one problem.  We dont have to worry about who to pay first.
Nellie told us about it.
We couldve had three weeks in Florida  all expenses paid.  Lying around in the sun  palm trees  frying fish...
Where are we running Joe?
Shave?  At a time like this?  Those guys got machine guns  theyre going to blast our heads off  and you want to shave?
How can they walk on these things? How do they keep their balance?
And its so drafty.  They must be catching colds all the time.
DAPHNE?
When I was a kid I used to have a dream  I was locked up in this pastry shop overnight  with all kinds of goodies around  jelly rolls and mocha eclairs and sponge cake and Boston cream pie and cherry tarts 
What are you doing?
Whats going on here?  Daphne  Daphne

What are you doing with my flowers?
Hi Jerry.  Everything under control?

Youre out of your mind  How can you get away with this?
Hey  these are real diamonds.

What are you giving me with the omelette?
Wait a minute  my bracelet.  What happened to my bracelet?

Didnt you girls say you went to a conservatory?
Its about the Florida job.
Whats wrong with us?
We could pass for that.
Just a moment miss   May I?
Let me carry one of the instruments.
You know Ive always been fascinated by show business.
So this year when George Whites Scandals opened she packed me off to Florida.  Right now she thinks Im out there on my yacht  deepsea fishing.
Oh of course.  which of these instruments do you play?
You must be quite a girl.
My last wife was an acrobatic dancer  you know sort of a contortionist  she could smoke a cigarette while holding it between her toes  Zowie  but Mama broke it up.

We can have it altered.
It doesnt matter.

I wouldnt say that.  Careless maybe.
Bingo?
That so?
You know  I play tenor sax.
Men
About the future.  You know  like a husband?  Thats why Im glad were going to Florida.
Men who wear glasses are so much more gentle and sweet and helpless. Havent you ever noticed?
Why not?
Thanks honey.
Wait a minute Daphne.  You havent got a bathing suit.
That must be it.
No  the ukulele.  And I sing.
Well I guess Id better go 
The most wonderful thing happened 
Three?
Oh  in here.
Its exquisite  like a floating mansion.
What is it?
Look at all that silverware.
Water polo  isnt that terribly dangerous?
Harmless  how?
I dont want to bore you.
Yes  all the money in the world  but what good is it?  Mint sauce or cranberries?
I may not be Dr. Freud or a Mayo Brother or one of those French upstairs girls  but could I take another crack at it?
I got a funny sensation in my toes  like somebody was barbecuing them over a slow flame.
How much do I owe the Milk Fund so far?
Really?
A merger?  How long will you be gone?
Oh  that kind of a merger.  Is she young? Pretty?
Real diamonds.  They must be worth their weight in gold.  Are you always this generous?
Do yourself a favor  go back where the millionaires are  the sweet end of the lollipop  not the cole slaw in the face and the old socks and the squeezedout tube of toothpaste 
Good evening sir.

Hi.

The one I made for you is the cherries. You hang onto it or give it back?
So whyd you let him go?
Not yet...

Dude do you know what youre doing?
I thought you had something planned.
Oh dear God...
Oh Lord what have we done...?
My fellow Americans. I have led this fight in the War against profanity. I have founded Mothers Against Canada.  Our neighbor to the north has abused us for the last time.
Maam were tracking a resistance... Its probably Canadian spies
I am the dark master
SILENCE  I AM SATAN
Terrance and Phillip are two VERY untalented unfunny actors from Canada. Their TV show is filled with toilet humor and bad language and is just complete garbage.  Now it appears they have a movie and Im positive its not suitable for children
What do you mean MOST why not ALL?
Mrs. Brovlofski the Vchip hasnt been fully tested yet it could be dangerous.
What? Why would you call me a pigfucker?
Its from your mother.
Youd fuck your uncle
Fight the power
The problem is you dont allow your children to think for themselves. You try to raise them in a protective bubble and then when they finally get old enough they realize theyve been lied to and they resent you for it.
Oh you are such a maroon
Oh Phillip.  This cannot be good.
Phillip this is worse than that trip to Quebec City when I fell asleep in that disco.
Sometimes I just think you dont have any respect for me.
Yeah  YEAH  Man Im getting so HOT
Thats because I wanted to fuck you dumbass Now hows aboot you get those pants down
What if I just left?
Didnt you think it was funny Wendy?
Hi Wendy.
NAZIS
Nothing Stan. You wouldnt understand.
Check.
Oh my God what is he doing?
Evening.
Well a little business too.  In my upcoming project Star Trackers I play a ships captain and I really wanted to get a feel for the outer space experience.  I feel it will add more credibility to my performance.
So...
No I think hygiene is important. It helps you get into the part.
Werent you down in the dining room?
No I just ran it  Why are you running it again?
Youre certain of that?
Well everythings running smoother than a babys ass.
You want to go back to shuttle work?
No.  Im all set.  Thanks.
The bridge is fine Taylor how are things down there?
Now do you want the good news first or the bad news?
Uh thats an affirmative Roger Wilco.  Please proceed.
I dont know what youre talking about
Is that clear?
Good.  Now youll hear from me when I have the new coordinates. In the meantime dont bug me.
Look at this...Jesus.
No.  But it buys a lot of other things.
Well...I dont mind.  I can put up with it.  Im taking six months off after this and I wont have to deal with people snapping their fingers at me.
Were going to die.
Oh right right youre on that research grant.
Ryan Taylor first mate.  Welcome aboard.  First time in space?
And suppose you couldnt hold out?
He certainly is polite.
Be careful you dont want to puncture the suit.
Explosive?
Do you want some advice?
Dawn  Dawn
Take this flare.
And what are you going to do?
Hes out of the equation.  Talk to me.
What the hell are you doing?
What do you mean?  What happened
So close...
In that case I accept.
No just enjoying the view.
So Ive been told.
Wheres Taylor?
How is it going to be different from this?  Go see some boring footprint under glass?
Well now what are we gonna do
Youre Delbert Miles  You have more clout than some whacked out pilot  Talk to him
I need you to actually do something for me.  I need to access your CPU directly.
Yeah but the ships mainframe doesnt. I need you to tell it something.
How is it looking Mac?
Ah come on lemme see your ball.
I hate fuckin opera.
You got an 8track tape player on purpose just cause you knew the only thing they had on 8track was fuckin opera.
She told us you went after Junior to save your old mans hide. You got some balls goin after that psycho.
The Faz sure took care a her.  Breeze makes a nasal GRUNT as he tries to suppress a snigger. Sid  trying to keep a straight face  elbows him. Sid and Breeze approach the coffin. Breeze pulls an orange whip out of a paper bag and carefully places it on the coffin lid.
Whats on your mind Miles?
And look at that both partners go down together. Kastle shoves the sculpture onto the floor stands up and crushes it under his heel. He goes over and puts his arm around Buzz.
Miles Ive always been on the square with you.
I got suspended when I was young too. I was pretty cocky in my day.
What do you think I can do?
Whered you get this ball?
What the fuck is this?
What makes you so sure it was me? She coulda had lotsa bowlers Theo rushes Buzz and grabs his arm. The two men struggle for the pin.
The whole world thinks youre underground.
It could just as easily have been me in that box.
What about bowling?
You give Ed Klein of the American Bowling Congress a call.  Tell him your Maynards boy. Hes expecting you and he owes me. Hell getcha back in like Flynn.  Dont say I never gave you nothing.
Oh sure. Let everyone in. From now on I leave the door wide open. Let the parade begin
Hes the guy Buzz.
Its not so bad. When Im alone it feels like someone else. Sheila grabs the bottle from Junior opens it and pours some on her shish kebab. She leans over and whispers furiously to her father.
Juniors a problem child. He has a thing about 
I have someone for you to play with Junior.
Hey enough fun and games. We have work to do. Come on Junior. Kastle heads for his car. Junior gets up and follows. The two sleazeballs tarry as Theo stands.
Buzz has been moving the cash out in hollow bowling pins. Sid and Breeze throw sideways glances at each other.
So youre Buzzs boy. Ive been expecting you. You hurt my feelings when you didnt come and see me sooner.
Rac. RAC. Renovate Automate Computerize. That my boy is the future. One of the monitors shows a little girl bowling. Her ball moves so slowly it barely tips over the first pin. Kastle hits a key and the pins explode in an emphatic strike. The little girl jumps with joy.
Wheres Junior?
After we eat Dad.
Dont go near the bowling alley.
I get them while theyre young. Builds loyalty.
Hole in one Youre the queen of stroke
Whoa.
You and your sideburns are the talk of the party Theo.
Can I ask you something personal?
Do you have a girlfriend?
So this brother of yours is hazardous to the health of your dates?
Unfortunately what he wants is you.
Do I want you?
I wanted to be a motocross champion. My folks didnt really care what I did. Then Junior blew a fuse and I became their last hope. Most girls get ballet stuffed down their throats I got bowling. I never understood how anyone could take it so seriously. I hope Im not insulting you.
So youre hoping Buzz can get you re instated?
Whats plan B?
Oh really? Nothing? My dad doesnt do anything unless theres something in it for him.
Come on Theo what about plan C?
Do you talk with your mom?
Come on bargain with me.
You professional men drive a hard bargain. Im afraid I only have five on me. Sheila pulls out a 5 dollar bill.
Im sure you wouldnt care if he needed your help right?
You know how people with broken bones know when theres a storm coming?
No but somethings gonna blow in this town. I can feel it.
I cant tell you Theo.
I saw your eyes when you hit that guy with your ball on TV. THUNDER rumbles. Theo takes Sheila by the shoulders.
Oh great He tried to kill me You knew he would go off if he thought I fooled around with you.
If Junior finds us hell kill us both.
You drag that coconut around for your health or do you know how to use it?
You guys got something going on downstairs?
Aagh Stop Those are my bowling fingers
Very good busyboy.
You faked my dads murder. You used him Where is he Theo chases Sid and Breeze around their car. He catches Sid and grabs the middle fingers on his right hand. Sid howls.
Captain open the hatch door please ... the hatch door Captain.  Open it please.
Let me out Captain.  Open the door
Get out of there
How big is this spacecraft?
In basic English what does all this mean?
It sends 200 volts throughout the cylinder surface.  But weve never used it underwater before.
Thirty yards.
Dont pull it Norman.  Itll start a ufireu we cant stop.  Norman?
Dont do it
Well thanks for the opportuninty here  my wife appreciates it.
A thousand?  An airplane crashes into a thousand feet of water  I dont want to sound pessimistic here but I assume there are no survivors.
What is it?  A military spacecraft? Like a shuttle or satellite?
Coral grows at a rate of two and a half centimeters a year 
The one you recommended.  In the ULF report you wrote for the Bush administration.
Your reports become our bible down here Dr. Johnson.  Weve been carrying out each of your recommendations  one by one  to the smallest detail.
At the time I dont know I thought putting her on the list  it might help her career  catch her a break.
What for?
You think he killed Edmunds?
Yes sir.  Im here.
Its not sucking sir.
What caused it?
Get him out of there.  I thought I told you people 
Nothing sir.
Edmunds get in here.  I need you for this.
No.  They dont represent a message. They arent decorative at all.  They have another purpose entirely.
So how do we get it open?
Man is man all he knows is man and all he can think of is what he knows.  The anthropomorphic problem. Good Norman.
Its a single sequence repeated over and over.
... spiralling out of the center you see G is one B is two H is three and so on... when I got the message.
What?
Some sort of lead or something.
Whats wrong?
Time travel.  I always thought it was one of those myths... like Santas reindeer.
They switched us over.
From the sphere?
What is that?
Well until we know exactly what it is nobody goes outside understood?
What do you expect?  For them to bring it up here?
Whered this come from?
Yeah it was awful.
Me?  Well I was wrapped in seaweed. It itched for a while but I survived.  Beth do you find it... curious that were seeing all this life down here.  Nothing and then these enormous flocks of squid.  Then jellyfish?
Wait a minute.
You knew about the squid not being normal.  Before Fletcher went out there?
Although advised of risks all personnel elect to remain down for duration of storm to continue investigation of alien sphere and associated spacecraft.  Signed Barnes USN.
You said something to him didnt you?
Its not worth the risk.
You fixed my suit?
The subs a 100 feet in front of you.  You see it?
... what do you mean?  Im in the ship.
None of this was here before.
No it wasnt.  I swear none of this was here.  None of it.  You think he hid it?  Earlier.  He mustve hid it.
He translated it wrong.
He acquired some sort of power.  A power to manifest things.
I dont know.
And thats the part of Harry thats being manifested.
Diphenyl parlene.
Tranquilizer.  Causes drowsiness.
Damn it  Chloramphenicol?
Whats that?
What was that?  I couldnt hear you.
Its getting cold.
You dont think I put something in it do you?
How do you feel about snakes?
What are they doing down here?  In the bathroom?  Suddenly appearing.
Did you?
Against what?  Harrys unconscious. Hes not a threat.
Youre lying 
Of course youre going to deny it. You want to blame someone else.  You want to blame Beth.  Because you hate Beth.
Beth
Beth stop it
Beth?
Dont tell me about me.  I already know too much.
You hear that?
Hows that?
He doesnt wait for an answer.
Pry the thing open?  What are we  neanderthals?
Yes you did.  Norman I wouldnt leave you out there.  You know that.
Im sorry.  Slip of the tongue.
Just in time too.
When did it come across?
How are you feeling Norman?
Cmon Norman.
Nice work Norman.
I cant believe that Harry.
I cant.  If I had a minute to think maybe but I know youre wrong.
Have you looked outside?  Jellyfish. Everywhere.  I hate jellyfish.  Harry what happened in the cafeteria?
Norman where are you?
Beth left?
What is it?
Fine.
Missed.
Hold on.
Well press something
There is one possibility.
The power allows us to manifest our fears right?  What if we feared the power to go away?
Well if its a discharge 
Dont gimme that psychology bullshit Norman.  Psychology isnt a science its superstition.  Its a bunch of soft subjective theories without any hard data to back it up. With an intellect like this emotions dont mean shit.
Norman Johnson.
By the way sir Ive read your report.  I think its brilliant.
You mean they havent told you yet?
Its not some fucking substitution code its a direct visual representation.
Jerry isnt hostile Norman.  He said earlier  we were his friends 
Theres nothing on the news about a crash.  Did he say what airline?
I think there are some things we should talk about.
I... Im not a Bendu Officer.  Im not even a startrooper.
You saw through me?
Im afraid Ive gotten too old for this sort of thing.
Luke Im coming along to do what I can but Im tired and Im depending on you to get us through.
When a creature dies the force it generated remains.  The Force is all around us.  It can be collected and transmitted through the use of a Kiber crystal.  Its the only way to amplify the power of the Force within you.
Are you all right?
I cant do it.  Ill get hit.
See once you let yourself go you can do it.  Youll get it.
Of course where you been kid?

We must hurry to the base.  We have little time before the Death Star arrives.
Organa Major is a rebel system. There will be quite a few starfleet patrols between here and there... It could be a little tricky if you want to avoid them... ten thousand.
No its impossible... No one and I mean no one would venture anywhere near the Alderaan system... Im a free booter not revolutionary.  Youre aboard the wrong ship son
Something has happened to them. Lets try this way...

I dont pick up any life form concentration down there.  Shed better be right.
I noticed you were having some problems Blue Five... I thought Id help.
The... ah doors jammed.  Give us a few minutes to get it fixed.
I said wed see.  And as it is I was forced to borrow your academy savings to buy the new droids.  When youve saved it up again Ill let you go.
Thats all right.  There is nothing anyone can do about it.  You can call me Luke.

I now the Captain meant no person al insult.
Navigational deflectors inoperative...  Directional control also inoperative Captain...

It appears that our message has been understood Captain.
They had a pattern to follow...
Klingons... our Epsilon 9 station ... and Ilia They seem to be more than just images...
If this is their ships data banks where is the crew? Or is their entire ship automated?
Were you right? Spock? Vger is a living machine...?
Captain the orbital device will      not be triggered for twentytwo       minutes...                           
Vger plans to literally UmeldU to reduce both itself and the Creator to patterns...

Hmmm.  But Consuelo even though your poor dont you have any hobbies or interests or anything?
But like what do you like to do when youre not working?
But when youre not. Like now. What do you like to do?
Consuelo. Are you crying?
Consuelo Im sorry but you know if you dont speak English I cant understand you.
Who is Jesus?
Im not making fun. Im showing it as it really is.
I was looking through Scoobys SATs practice books this afternoon and I took one of the practice tests. Guess what score I got?
Sure...
What are you going to do?
We did the same thing last year also.
I can read it to you.
Well actually its the same but longer. I think its better. More...raw.
What do you want?
What the fuck are you talking about? Whats OK?
But what kind of pull did you have?
I think Scoobys like a lot of kids. He just hit aa speed bump. Now hes gonna find his way his path is gonna be cleared and I think hes gonna continue his education at a good college. And everybody else is gonna be happy.
What DO you know?
Whaddya wanna talk about?
I just want to know what the hell hes doing in his room thats so interesting he doesnt come down for dinner.
Yeah uh listen. Why dont you go upstairs and keep your Mom and Brady company for a bit? I need to speak alone with Consuelo for a moment.

You know...I like you.
Does that include Helen Filmore United States congresswoman?
Uhoh  Do you know if the demands are being taken seriously at this point or does Washington think these people are just a bunch of crazy fuckers playing games?
Ill lead.
Anything else?  Maybe a sandwich?
Lets move it we got company
Hes a very stubborn man sometimes...
What do you mean?
I drew my gun ran in the direction of the cries...violating the first rule of service...I let the Ambass ador out of my sight.
Well Filmore
Are the labs in operation?
Go fuck yourself...
Come on drink up.
I insist...
Well?
Why the hell didnt you tell us this was at stake
And what exactly do they intend to do?
What do they have in there thats so valuable?  A cure for AIDS a cure for cancer?
Something tells me you dont want to be on TV friend.
KZ...70...70...nine.  It checks out.
Where the hell could they have gone
I want the girl.  I dont care about the restbut a US congresswoman taken hostage will make for great copy. Well make headlines all over the world...
Well there was uh a little dissent about the amount of the bonus
Of the separate chemicalsI dont know uh offhand
Can I have a glass of water?
Thank you Admiral.
Where are you trying to reach him?
If hes not there try...  87  43  56.
Mister Ambassador what on earth possessed your country to build this weapon?
Yes?
Damn you de Sade  You know as well as I do that this was the act of a mentally sick man  a single individual whose crackup can probably be traced to the strains and tensions caused by your country.
Dont you dare touch me  What the devil do you think youre doing?
Please Mister President I am extremely shy and do not wish to endure this sort of personal humiliation.  Here is the only other camera I have left. 
Major?...Major?  Im Colonel Bat Guano 701 Battalion.
What happened Major?  Some kind of private beef between the two of you?
Now look Im picking up this ordinary telephone.  See?...Hello?...Hello?... Nuts the lines must still be disconnected.  The General had us disconnect... 
Youve wasted enough of my time fella.
Im sorry sir.  General Schmuck is asleep and he isnt taking calls until eightthirty.
Go back to sleep baby.
General Schmuck?
Just a second sir.  Hes got films of the War Room in that thing
Under the circumstances General what would you think they should do?
Combat Operations Center Major Mandrake speaking.
Youddont think Id ask if you recognized my voice unless it was important do you Major?
Let me worry about that Major. Ive still got my red line to the Air Command.
No calls from inside out.  No calls from outside in are even answered.  No calls.
No calls at all.  With or without my sayso. My voice can be imitated too Major.
Are you hard of hearing Major?
Dont fret about it Major.  Theres nothing anyone can do about it now.  Im the only one who knows the threeletter code group for the CRM114.
General Ripper can I ask another question?
But then why do you want to kill a hundred and sixty million of our people sir?
But even then we wouldnt get everything.  I mean some missiles would abort or theyd miss their targets or maybe the enemy have some secret bases we dont know about.
But if you just let things alone we wouldnt lose anyone.
Where sir?
And I guess they wont until they agree to let us inspect inside their country.
I dont know sir.  But theyre just as anxious to avoid a nuclear war as we are. War just doesnt make sense any more for anybody.
Go on Major.
Go on Major.  You fascinate me.
No Major I dont.  They have no regard for human life.  They wouldnt care if they lost their whole country as long as they won.
Major youre talking like one of them
Dont be offended Major.  Our President holds the same views.
Ill tell you what I do think.  If they say theyre for disarmament I say anyone who says theyre for disarmament is either a traitor or a damned fool.
Im afraid so Mister Presient. Being part of the airborne alert each plane is carrying a full load  about fifty megatons apiece.
Thats right sir.  But the planes were at their Positive Control points ready to turn around when General Ripper issued the final Gocode.
Yes sir.  The base commander General Ripper selected PlanR?
Well sir PlanR is an emergency plan to be used by lower echelon commanders if higher echelons have been knocked out by a sneak attack.
But hell hear everything were saying.  And if he just looks out of that window hell see everything were doing. 
How do you know they were shot down Buck?
Have you tried the recall again?
Is there any chance a single aircraft can penetrate the entire enemy Air Defense when its course and target are known?
We should be crossing the coast in about six minutes.
You know what thatll do to our fuel consumption.
Hes right.  We wouldnt have started it.
Maximum ECM.
Check.
Roger.
Sorry King.  My legs stiff as a board.
No this looks like the real thing.
Primary arming switch.
Yep its the CRM114 code all right.
Whats your point Lothar?
Second safety.
Primary bomb is live.
How do you know hes dead?
You sure have to hand it to those guys.
What do you mean?
Wait a minute Major.  OPE thats the recall code.  Where would they get that?
Whos that?
Lothar can you arm the bombs for impact?
Theres no other way Lothar.  Can you rearm the bombs for impact?
I thought Id go along for the ride.
King would you mind if I keep me hands on the wheel when you take her in?
Thanks King.  Ive always wanted to take one of these big babies in.
Umhm.
I just walked all the way from Westside to here. I havent walked that far since junior high. I thought you didnt drink.
We were all riding around and it suddenly hit me what we were doing. We were getting off on the fact that were in a car teen feet longer than all the rest. And I got out and I just started walking.
Yeah but when I was walking I realized that hes stuck in that limo all the time. Hes stuck with his interviews hes stuck with his autograph he has to do whatever his manager tells him to do you know? Hes not free. Hes just part of the machine and if you think about it freedoms all that there really is.
That was really great.
Uhhuh.
Typical male.
Want a beer?  Is Pony coming?
I was doing schrooms and I saw this cloud. It looks excellent on tape. The video is like my head and and everything you know is like is like in there that I see. You know? Plus Im gonna come down here one night and walk around inside the Circle A with the camera and tape shit.
Any gunshot victims?
Sounds like a bummer.
No hes not with a girl.
That sounds so great man. Yes. Yes. Hey what would you do in the afternoon?
A long long long...
Go
Hey Whoa you look like shit. You been home yet?
Yeah. Get ahold of Sooze?
She was at the Four Seasons last night man. But you shouldnt worry about that.
Sure.
Yeah.
But Id Id do it for free. You know just for my reel.
Oh and guess who showed up.

Jeff Jeff if you want to be alone with Pony you know thats thats fine with us.
I mean you know at least I admit that I dont know. I know that things are fucked up beyond belief and I know that I have nothing original to say about any of it alright? I dont have an answer. I dont have a fucking message.
See ya later.
To women. Theyre all whores. Let us not forget what Chenowsky said. The greatest men are the most alone. And without suffering Jeffery you will never gain wisdom.
Yeah. Yeah no youre right. Its no big deal you know. Guy probably has his arm around her right now holding her close nudging her titty with his elbow talking about the deep significance of his music while she looks up at him with her big brown eyes. In a few minutes theyll be back at the Four Seasons. You ever you ever stayed in one of those places?
Anarchy my friend. Fuck em. You know what I mean?
No no say it like this. Fuck em
Oh no no no. This is no big deal you know? I can come down and and get you out.
You lied to me.

I called your agent.  I called the Screen Writers Guild.  Finally your old apartment gave me some Crestview number.  There was always somebody with an accent growling at me.  You were not there.  You were not to be spoken to.  They never heard of you.
Just so you dont think Im a complete swine  if theres anything in Dark Windows you can use take it.  Its all yours.
I mean it.  Its no good to me anyway.  Help yourself.
What about all those ideas you had?
Psychopaths sell like hotcakes.

Is this how?

Because you remind me of all the dumb things I said.
Im not mad at you.
Theres something very dangerous about her. Something evil...
A little.
Oh no not you again.
Yes yes I saw the whole thing. How could you be interested in that puny little girl?
You cant put her out of your mind is that it?
Hey where you going?
I had to dump the papers in a trashcan. The Danvers have been arrested
I saw them dragged out of the Administration Building.
I cant help it if men notice me.
I sure wish Superman was around. He wouldnt let any of this go on. Not for one minute.
Superman will return it.
Im sorry... I didnt know.
I can do that.
I have money to buy more but I havent had a chance since...
Keep an eye peeled for Myra. Shes out to get you.
Go back sign in and climb out the bathroom window. McCloskeys always zonked out shell never hear you.
Listen I know Ive been saying you ought party more but keep your hands off this one will yak? Hes private property. Ive been waiting years for him to develop.
Youre not gonna stay for the ice cream?
Cheer up Nigel. Its not the end of the world.
You think you are on top now. Well there is someone coming to challenge you. I saw it in the cards this morning.
You better have a pretty good explanation for this Selena.
Maybe youd like to get rid of this Supergirl yourself Nigel?
Youve run out of things to throw Selena.
Whats it like?
Where is inner space?
There is a way.
Youre going to take me back?
Whats that? Never saw anything like that.
Yes mustnt stop.
Goodbye...
Yeah? What do you want?
What are you talkin about?
Not enough vodka in it.
Aha Whatd I tell ya
Got vodka in it now. Gotta give it a new name. Hey listen you thought it up well name it after you. Whats your name?
Here I am honey and Im all yours.  Remember when you were Queen of the Prom? All the guys had to wait in line to get a dance.  But now theres only one name on your dance card sweet thing and its 
You look wonderful.
You shouldnt say that youre the chairman   ...uh chairperson...
And three years after the Royal Wedding the King abdicated.  Isnt that terrible?
That song. I remember one day I came into the music room and you were fooling around at the piano. And I thought  what am I going to do with all this potato salad?
It isnt only that hes small for his age. how would you like to be the only kid in town without a father?  Look at him hes stewed to the gills in the middle of the afternoon.
He really was
Hi Lois. Morning Jimmy youve got mustard on your lapel. Excuse me Mr. White I dont mean to interrupt but 
Uh...excuse me folks...
Do you really know Superman?
Anyway the reunions just the hook for the story. What its really about is how the typical small towns changed in the last fifteen years. how do you like this a title Can You Go Home Again ?
Youre the best Lois.
Name?
Ah yes August Gorman. Have you looked for work this week Mr. Gorman?
Mr. Gorman according to our records you have been unemployed for 36 weeks.
You are I was about to say no longer eligible.
Actually its probably more like 143.80 and onehalf cent.  Theres always fractions over in a big corporation but they round it down to the lowest whole number.
Youve been a naughty boy havent you?  Cmon now admit it you were kinda naughty.
Gus do you know what I want now? I want coffee
But ysee chum the problem I got is that one country just wont play ball with me.  You know how that can just bug a guy dont you?
How do you do that?
Always making yourself beautiful for me arent you?  So Gus can you make Vulcan do what I want it to? You didnt answer me pal.  Did you hear about that prison riot last week? It seems they were complaining about rats in the cells...
When?
Hey boss.
Uh...what channel were you watching?
Every oil tanker and super tanker and superdupertanker in the ocean is controlled. totally by computers. Computers to tell them where to go how much oil to take on where to deliver it.
And then shut down the pipe lines.
Lookit youre getting what you want all the time. it aint right that I dont get somethin I never get somethin
Now...when do I get a taste?
Is this blackmail?
A wastebasket? GUS Those are plans.  Blueprints.
Everything.
Remember Gus. A machine doesnt want anything except to keep on being a machine. Youve got to make sure it can figure out how to beat any opponent.
Hey listen I didnt know your mama was comin by...
Through the telephone line terminal that aint nothin.
All right Kent. I just hope you know what youre doing. If you really think Smallville is your big chance go for it.
Hey Id definitely shoot color on that one Jimmy. Itd be a crime to just use black and white.
Ross honey its time for your massage...
If you dont mind we are trying to hold a meeting here
I cant Its out of control
Mr. White please its time for you to draw this months winning JINGO number.  The prize is an allexpenses trip to South America.
53.
Mr. White the next number please?
Mr. White you be in this shot handing them their plane tickets.
I dont know who. Whom. I cant trace it.  In the old days it was simple. We kept books we had ledgers we could see what was going in and what was paid out. If somebody wanted to rob you hed come in with a gun and say stick em up.  Now they get theses blasted computers to do their dirty work
I dont kiss.
It could make weather
You mean...you mean...Vera Vera The magnitude of this
He ruined it That lousy dogooder he ruined it.
And now that Supermans out of the Nice Guy business...
Jimmy hows the 
Yeah thanks. . . . I mean really Posing as newlyweds to uncover the honeymoon racket in Niagara Falls.  I mean. imagine wasting a great reporter    uh reporters  on this.  Perry White and his Sunday Magazine exposes.
I dont know they look pretty happy to me...
Where were you?
Lois I dont have the vaguest idea  as usual  what youre 
Oh Clark no
Its true. Its true.
Im in love with you. How do you feel?
Maybe we ought to hire a bodyguard from now on.
Hi.
Me too Oh I tried to convince myself believe me Its like being married to a doctor I said. Doctors are practically never at home. The get emergency calls in the middle of the night and their wives manage to live with it. Then a voice said  could you be a doctors wife? Or are you too selfish . . . 
They?
Lois someday 
See what happens when I dont have my orange juice?  The human body is only a workable fairly fragile machine when you treat it with the same respect youd show to   . . . gee . . .
But . . ..thats terrible
What??
A good time Is that all you care about?
I like trees.
This way Lex.
No me me me. Thank you.
It has everything.
And she  the one you have chosen  she feels as much for you?
And so our scientists constructed from an irreversible mathematical equation the Phantom Zone. In it we imprisoned these three archvillains for all eternity.
The Elders have of course thought long and hard about that question.
The one danger we have considered is that the Phantom Zone might  we cannot predict  just might be cracked by a nuclear explosion in space. I cannot say I am glad you asked me that 
Why?
OTIS your brain defies any known scientific laws in its infinite capacity to deteriorate. Every man has a vulnerable point. Some like you Otis have more that one. I didnt see Supermans in time. But now through patience invention and skill my black box is just about ready.
I never did this before . . . I have to tell you.
Too late Luthor. Too late . . .
What more?
Im the man theyre protecting. Im the President. Ill kneel before you if it will save lives.
There will be no attack? No attempt to overpower the terrorists?
So this is the planet Houston . . .
This super man is nothing of the kind. I have discovered his weakness.
Hes captured Non
I feel kind of lightheaded . . .
Then prove it. Lois is doing an interview with Superman about his peace mission . . .
Oh probably just a picture request. Ill take care of it if you want Lois.
Are you or are you not part of a plot to weaken our national defense?
Superman? Has something happened to him?
But Superman isnt an average man.
Would you mind taking a walk with me?
Awesome
Darling its good riddance. Let her go. And while youre at it fire that Clark Kent. He hasnt been here in days. He hasnt even called.
No Daddy. Our business is journalism. We cant continue to be so irresponsible . . . or else well just lead everyone into a disaster.
But all men like me Lois. Im very rich.
Are we going to skip the country Uncle Lex?
Do you realize what I can create with a single strand of Supermans hair
Gee Uncle Lex I dont think this guys much of a dancer.
The one Superman wrecked up?
Youre spookin me out Uncle Lex.
Of course Thats his one vulnerability. The one way he can be stopped.
You think hell find us.
Destroy Superman
Theres some slice American cheese...and...a half a bottle of club soda I think.
Ah The guest of honor at last And about time too
I talked to Ben Hubbard this morning. Hell be more than glad to bring in the crops on shares.
Do you know where youre headed?
Id like to.
Your bookie?
Hey
For what? Oh Ive see the way the other half lives. My sister for instance. it looks terrific but is that what I really want? Three kids two cats and fifteen needlepoint pillows? Id go bananas after one week. Hell I need this crazy existence of mine.  Like I need the plague right? Thats what your thinking.
There werent any wires. I looked.
Oh what a chance If I could just    get to him.
Listen...thank you.
Oh.
This??
Speaking of feeding things what about dinner?
Nuts. He made it.
Krypton
Meteorites
Tune me in  lady. An explosion such as the one Superman describes would have altered the molecular structure of the Krypton rock.
About Vesuvius. About Superman writhing in the bowels of the volcano.  Ahh the look on his face when he saw that Kryptonite. When will I see another yknow? Yknow?
Weak sister.  I still cant figure out why it took so long for you to catch up with us after we all ran out. Yknow?
Dont let me down.
Youre not going to hit me?
She knows. Clever very clever.  And unappreciated. But Im going to take you away from all this.
You got wax in your ears?
Danger??  Somebody??? Lex   where are you going?
My friends I am not a rash impulsive person. Im not given to wild unsupported statements. We must evacuate this planet immediately
Two.
Got all As this year. Teacher said hes the best 5th grader in the 
They are primitive Lara but they are not animals.
Youve been doing some research in the archives.
I dont know what to say.  Look I  I just 
Lois the kickback story...
Who...who...
Oh.  Well where do we start?
Oh.
It must feel great.
How old are you?
Whats the matter Otis?
And now he lies to me. He has been stealing ladies purses again.  Havent you? Havent you you miserable petty crook?
Theyre killing me by inches  Go ahead Make me suffer Milk me dry.
At the San Andreas Fault. Maybe youve heard of it.
Yes.
Ally Jones.
I dont remember the name.  It was near a beach.
What...does it turn to?
I can help you.
Leave us alone Stephens.  Leave the people of this town alone.  You cant help.
Hi Nicole.
They just finished supper.
Ill be back around nine.
Are you sure?
Because its what we have to do.
Ive tried to stay out of it.  But it turns out thats not so easy Sam.  Youve gone and got yourself this lawyer.  Mitchell Stephens. You and Risa and Wendell and the Ottos.
Thats wrong Sam.  You know that. Well be tangled up in this thing for the next five years.  This is never going to go away...
Its not enough.  For hospital bills.  For Nicole.
Does this mean I cant take a shower?
Mr. Stephens says that someone didnt put a right bolt in the bus...
I have to.
Because I have to.
I mean the way they look.  Their hair and clothing...
From what?
Yes.  The oldfashioned way.
What do you mean?
Thats right.
And Billy told you that hell tell that to...
Its clear to me and other people that you have suffered significantly from this event.
You want a cup of tea or something?
I didnt ask if you wanted milk.
What happened to summer?
They work for the people were trying to sue.  Their job is to try to minimize damages.  Our job Nicole is to try to maximize them. You have to think of it that way. As people doing their jobs.  No good guys or bad guys.  Just our side and their side.
Theres no such thing as an accident Nicole.  Not in a situation like this.
I object to the form of that question.  Note that.
Note my objection.  She said As Im talking.
What about Doreen?
What do you mean?
Crafts.
Here we go.
We do.
It should be said that my task is to represent the Walkers only in their anger.  Not their grief.
You think someone else caused the accident?
My usual place.  On the right side. The first seat.
You saw the speedometer?
What do you remember about the accident?
That was great.
Do you like the colour?
Nothing good on your T.V.?
Yes.
Will the police do anything to her?
That sonofabitch owes thousands to the bank and half the businesses in town.  Hes about to lose his house and car.
Yeah well they probably smoke weed.
But of course...
Boys this gets nobody nowhere  youre over excited Steve and 
I still think hes responsible for the smear.
Joe give my nephew a drink.
You told me that your boy was washed up with Susie Hunsecker didnt you?
You told him that?
When do these hotheaded boys of yours go on the road?
Listen Frank youd better make sure youre telling me the truth.
You dont know that lunatic yet? Whims  egotistic whims  Like the gag  when you got him for a friend you dont need an enemy  Thats what the fight with Bartha was about. Leo I says Hunsecker froze me out.  So Im eating humble pie this month  please print me an item.
Friends call me Otis  sometimes Tricky Otis.
I hate J.J.  but not that much at this moment...
Why do you keep coupling me with Falco?
Its just as if Ive seen a ghost today...
You know dear were drifting apart you and I and I dont like that.
I started to say were drifting apart.  A year ago in your wildest dreams would you have walked by that door without taking up this situation with me?  Today I had to call you in
When Im certain Ill let you know...
Susie did you know about this accusation...?
You in a mood Susie to run over to Milgrims later and buy a few new frocks?
Hello Harry.
Why dont you answer the man Sidalee?  Hes trying to take you off the hook.
What some cheap gruesome gags?
I know Steve.  No.
How?
He means that much to you...?
But its too late.  I got him back the job...
Why do something that would drive them right back into each others arms?  Not to mention that this time Susie would know who shot the arrow...
Is that a fact?  Hes a dilly aint he?  By the by what did he have against this boy?
I thought he would.
Bribing me again?
Who put this item in about the comic?  If theres a more hilarious funny man around than Herbie Temple at the Palace youll have to pardon us for not catching the name.  We were too busy screaming. Does this Temple have a press agent?
And where was his wife?
I wish I could help in some way Sidney.
You mean you dont want the extra free gift of a colorful giant map of the world???
Or what you see in me for that matter...
Its a habit with me.  So now Im briefed.  So what?
Thats your idea of logic?  I tell the Judge I didnt murder the man  the Judge says Why not you?
You watch him Al I s...s...stutter
And it would cost a pretty penny huh?
And Im sorry for you too Sidney. Youre going down with the ship.
J.J. if you think 
Listen when your band was playing at Roseland 
But he could be reporting back to your brother couldnt he?
I just didnt think that I could antagonize him Steve  for OUR sake I mean.
No  Im saying that for your sake you have to make a clean break with your brother
You going to work all day?
Radical.
Im right here.  Im fine.  Whats the dogs name?
Well why doesnt become a bomb or something to get me?
Negative.  She is not a mission priority.
Jesus... you were gonna kill that guy
Whattaya mean why?  Cause you cant
Now remember youre not gonna kill anyone right?
Thats great  See youre getting it.
Excellent.
Killing Dyson might actually prevent the war.
No
So shes pretty cool huh?
Yeah.  Drag huh?
John get out of the way
I know
I know but Im not as strong as Im supposed to be.  I cant do it.  Im screwing up the mission.
You broke my arm
Basically.  The Skynet funding bill is passed.  The system goes online August 4th 1997.  Human decisions are removed from strategic defense.  Skynet begins to learn at a geometric rate.  It becomes selfaware at 214 a.m. eastern time August 29. In a panic they try to pull the plug.
Because Skynet knows the Russian counterstrike will remove its enemies here.
Its finally over.
You represent the United States now. We have a moral duty to be just and we have to be seen to be just.
Major thats not a good argument. If Dr. Furtwngler did indeed enjoy all these... these privileges he enjoyed them because of who he is and what he is. Thats true of any leading artist in any country in the world.
Yes Im a Jew. But I like to think first Im a human being.
So Major tell me have you questioned Dr. Furtwngler?
But what... before that turns rotten...  What if they surround the space with barbed wire Colonel?
Yeah yeah art and politics yeah yeah I heard all about that.
This is what Im saying. He must have had Party contacts.
Let Furtwngler go. Please.
Im kidding Emmi. What about a record player? You have that too?
Then why did you conduct at one of their Nuremberg rallies?
How come?
Your guess is as good as mine.
Tough tough
Why were they going to arrest you?
So how did you learn that the Gestapo was out to get you?
You were real close to all of them to Adolf to Hermann to Joseph to Baldur and now Albert  So lets hear the truth lets come clean. What was your Party number?
It is now nine oclock precisely. I do not intend to be kept waiting again.
You wont find it because no such telegram exists.
Then you are wrong.
have no idea what ordinary people thought.
Stop this please stop this now
Okay Wilhelm go home now. Go home and think about these past twelve years.
Helmuth Alfred Rode. Second violinist since 1935. Whats it mean second violinist?
Oh we didnt play for his birthday we played the evening before  it was the 19th of April not the 20th.
Major.
Yes you remember.
Great catch kid. The boy runs off.
I can give you freedom of movement freedom to work freedom Helmuth. But I need something in return.
One of your people told me.
But I need documentary proof. You know of anything like that?
Edwin von der Null. Music critic. He gave Furtwngler terrible reviews while he raved about Herbert von Karajan.
And ask him about his private life.
Well they say here that when you went on a case you stayed on it.  Now we cant take every Nazi in this country to trial although I would like to its an impossibility. So were going for the big boys in industry education law culture.
I have your questionnaire here. It says you were never a member of the Nazi Party.
It was Hermann Goering. I was told he just made the maestro his Privy Councillor no questions asked. Although Dr. Furtwngler stood up to him. And to Dr. Goebbels.
Mission control to Chuck come in...
Arent I worth waiting for?
Can you handle it?
Anything else?
Im going to a movie kiddo. See ya.  You and Matt have a good time.
I havent seen you in here lately Mr. Miller.
Compared to me she is.  How come youre not at the cash anymore?  They catch ya steal ing?
But outside its living human tissue.  Flesh skin hair...blood.  Grown for the cyborgs.
Theres so much...
This is gonna make me puke. Talk about something.
Look.  I found it.  Isnt that it?  Cyber Dynamics Corporation?
Whatever...they become the hotshot computer guys so they get the job to build El Computer Grande...Skynet...for the government.  Right?
Whats that?
And so you feel nothing.
Im sorry.  I shouldnt have said...
I see.  And this...computer thinks it can win by killing the mother of its enemy kill ing him in effect before he is even conceived?  A sort of retroactive abortion?
Okay lets see...Got a pos itive on her.  Shes Sarah Connor works as a legal
Heres her drivers license.
That stuffs two hours cold.
Go  Go  Hes got her.
It is so very inappropriate for you to mention my father.  Or did you think this between us was friendship?  Just because you went fishing with my father I should sit on my hands while you throw my money away?
I only mention it because I took the test this afternoon down on Montgomery Street.
Terrific.  I now have a hundred dollar dry cleaning bill.
I want to know whats going on.  Are you part of this?
Youve got to be kidding.
Its run by a company... they play elaborate pranks.  Things like this. Im really only now finding out myself.
The lights went out one hundred people all ran away...
Dont even think about it.
Ill give you a boost.
This isnt an attempt to be gallant. If I dont lift you how are you going to get there?
This is C.R.S.
Youre the one who started running.
That one did.
Never did catch your name.
Goodnight.
I think I would remember.  What makes you think its me?
What did you say?
Who is it?
Mm... I wouldnt worry about it.

You need anything?
Will you?
Do it for YOU.
Calm down.  Why would they keep playing after you paid?
Do you know how to change a tire?
Because you hate me.  Because you had to be here when mom died.  Because you had to do it alone.  Well dont you think if Id known... Idve been here too.  Id have been here...
What?
Well help with the police if you want to bother.  As far as money goes... can I make a suggestion?  You say you were mugged?
Its just a t.v.  Hes just an actor.
Jim Feingold V.P. E.D.A. Engineering and Data Analysis.
I dont write the questions.  I just review them.
We want a sense of your overall capabilities limitations turnons turnoffs...

Anything wrong... ?
Nicholas...

He hasnt called back.
You know what I love about wine that comes in bottles like this?
I only saw Theo drive up.
Couldnt get the last ones.  You?
So why did you need the Addams Family mansion for a scientific test?
That could have been worse.
Luke can I talk to you?
Do you need me anymore?  Cause Im going to bed.  They can stay up talking another 45 minutes if they want but I gotta try to get some sleep.
Is that the question of compassion or science?
Its not going to hold your weight.
Well this lot is full
What did it smell like?
So... smell... is... Smell is the sense that triggers the most powerful memories.  And a memory can trigger a smell.
Like she smelled it too?
Are you coming to confess?
Lets say it wasnt you.  Who did it?
The children want me.  Theyre calling me.  They need me.
But you told me to look in the paper  You told me Id be perfect
Yes this is Doctor Marrow.
When do we take the tests?
Well this is a cozy breakfast.
Maybe theyre Marys.
Your fear of him was real.  Thats all the ghost anyone needs.
Why do you need a chain like that?
Theyre so beautiful.  Arent they?
Thatd be seventy in New York. You stole it
Ohh sure you have trouble with commitment.
Theo... Did you?
Then who is?  Come on Nell.  Deep down if you really thought it wasnt Jim why wouldnt you be leaving right this second?  Why wouldnt you be afraid?  Really afraid.

Trained lots of people whove gone on to have big concert careers symphony orchestras the works. His name is Jacques Carcanogues. Im not sure Im pronouncing it right. Anyway hes a Frenchman.

...Yeah its a tough break.
Theres some kind of animal loose in the museum.  Pendergasts alone.  He needs help.  I want volunteers to go with me.
Ive read about the Museums financial troubles.
I got it after I was mugged in the subway last spring.
Behind you.
Forget it
Batterys dead.  Shit.
Ippolito  Get back here
Who are you?  The undertaker?
Saliva test?  You mean you think someone ate part of the brain?
How big is the subbasement?
Lieutenant  Its me.
Its still back there
What are we talking about here?
Now Margo dont overreact.  Cuthbert has to cut costs somehow.  My leaving makes perfect sense.  This isnt exactly early retirement.  Ive overstayed the party a bit.
With all due respect dear thats bull.  You dance rings around me with your new technology.  Youve left me in the dust.
Come on.  Ill walk you back to the elevator.
This isnt a death sentence.  Greg has promised to teach me fly fishing.  Ill garden.  Ill write.
That Cuthbert.  What a piece of work. Someones dead and all he cares about is his Superstition Exhibit.
What is it?
Like the claw.
Look at this.  An ambyloid reovirus protein.  That explains why the computers confused.  The plants infected with a virus.
All right assuming the program is accurate this is a description of the animal with that claw.  Species unidentified.  Genus unidentified.  Phylum unknown.  Male weight in excess of 240 kg.  Brain capacity 900 centimeters. That means its highly intelligent. Quadrupedal.
With the intelligence of a human being the speed of a greyhound and the strength of a grizzly bear.
Whats going on?
None of that matters now.  The people upstairs need us.  We have to help.
Come back and get me.
Thank you for taking the time to help us with this Dr. Frock.
We think it may have something to do with the eggs we found in the crate.
Dr. Frock I was wondering.  What happened to the rest of Whittlesleys plants?
We were just lost okay?  And we went down this curvy staircase.  At the bottom was a big shadow.
Not that big.
It had a long tongue teeth this big and yellow eyes.
Hard to read in this light.  The ink is so faded.
Stop
Its alright.  I can tell by the way the dogs acting that whatever was out there is gone.  What is this place?
Jesus what is this?
If I spent half the time on my Fractal Evolution thesis that I spend on this fly rod Id have my PhD.
Turkish Gecko I believe.  A lizard.
If he were alive hed have contacted me.
That was two years ago.  John was still in love with me.  He wouldnt leave me alone.
My God.  Then it was an animal.
What happened?
I heard you calling and I ran after you but you kept disappearing and I couldnt keep up.
What was it?
Pendergast?  Are you all right?
I dont know how to deal with this. Its hellish.  Like nothing I ever saw.  Im not trained to deal with a monster a supernatural creature like that.
But what can we do?  Our guns are useless 
That was DAgosta.
Is there another way around?
What happened?
We have to try and draw it off
Just like John.  He wont listen.
Viti Levu.  For how many?
The catalyst for the recent dramatic events was of course Trumans father Kirk and his infiltration onto the show. Before we discuss that its worth reminding viewers that this isnt the first time someone from the outside world has tried to reach Truman.
Of course there hasnt been anything to compare with this  the first time an intruder has been a former cast member
Lets talk ratings.  Truman has always enjoyed top ten status but the huge surge over the last few dayshow do you hope to sustain that audience now that Truman appears to have reconciled himself?
Yes everything you see on the show is for sale  from the actors wardrobe food products to the very homes they live in
Sure she would.
See here this is us.  All the way round here Fiji.  You cant get any further away before you start coming back.  Yknow there are still islands in Fiji where no human has ever set foot.
You really think it couldve dropped off an airliner?
I think its got something to do with my dad.
I dont know what to think Marlon. Maybe Im going out of my mind but I get the feeling that the world revolves around me somehow.
...personally I think the unconquered south face is the only one worth scaling...of course its a 20000 foot sheer wall of ice but then when did that ever stop me before?...Naturally I intend to make the ascent without the benefit of oxygen but also without crampons or even an ice pick...irisks?i...  ...sure Im aware of the riskswhy else do you think I would spend seven years as an adjuster in a life insurance company...?
Whats that?
Where have you been?
What did you want?
Blocked at every turn.  Beautifully synchronized dont you agree?
Its hard to go places isnt it?
Truman what about that sign?
Let me get you some help Truman.  Youre not well.
Stop this now.  Ill do it.  I swear.
What are my plans now?  Well next Im thinking of tackling the Yuba River in an authentic canoe from the Algonquin tribe. Im talking about the north fork a class five rapid  only Im not going idowni the Yuba Im going iup.i  Do you honestly think for one minute Id go back to some dreary office to rubber stamp meaningless documents...do you?
We ought to be getting you back Mother.
Hows it going Truman?
I think you better tell us.
I need your clothes Byers.
And you have conclusive evidence of this? Something to tie this claim of yours to the crime 
This mans still alive.
Do you want me to destroy this one too? Before it gestates?
And if its unsuccessful?
You want a call if we turn up Kurtzweil?
You follow me out here for a reason?
Who sent you?
Michaud was a twentytwo year veteran of the bureau 
I picked up the historical document of the venality and hypocrisy of the American government. The daily newspaper.
You told me you had answers.
Youve been using me 
You didnt know my father 
Youd be shit out of luck if not for me. You saw what you saw because I led you to it. Im putting my ass on the line for you.
Mulder...?
Jesus Mulder...
Had you.
Where are you Mulder?
Scully?
What? What are you talking about?
This isnt about you Scully. Theyre doing this to me.
This is one of the firemen who died in Dallas?
And theres been no autopsy performed. Theres no Y incision here no internal exam.
Mulder this is going to take some time and somebodys going to figure out soon enough were not even supposed to be here.  Im in serious violation of medical ethics.
This looks like new grass to you?
Grounds dry about an inch down. Somebody just laid this down. Very recently Id say.
Unmarked tanker trucks... what are archaeologists hauling out in tanker trucks?
And where are they going with it?
Were not chasing trucks were chasing evidence 
Been where?
You hear that?
Whered they go?
I can Mulder. I debated whether or not to even tell you in person because I knew 
Im contacting the state board Monday to file medical reinstatement papers 
Why was I assigned to you? To debunk your work. To reign you in. To shut you down.
...my pulse feels thready and Ive got a funny taste in the back of my throat.
On whose orders?
Agent Mulder  we both know that if you and Agent Scully hadnt taken the initiative to search the adjacent building you could have multiplied the fatalities by a hundred 
Shes in there right now saying the same thing about you.
A virus?
Until Dallas we believed the virus was simply a controlling organism. That mass infection would make us a slave race.
Weve allowed this man his freedom. His books have actually helped us to facilitate plausible denial. Has he outlived his usefulness to us?
You cant kill Mulder. Hes got too much light on him.
Weve been over this a dozen times.  No.
I do it all the time
Id be there for him.
The first... What?  Six or seven times I went in.   Remember what happened?
I refilled the Zyprexa and Atavan...
...give a kiss to Edward.
What if he wasnt like this?  What if he was normal?  Conscious.  How far would you go?
This man is deeply disturbed he...
Absolutely.  I suppose everyone does.
Whoa.  Hold on.  Arent they the same guy?
He wants us to follow.  The little boy...
That went well.
Hes mine?
Thank you.
She changed the codes.
Instead of going into his mind...
Is she alright?
Youre looking well.
Hows the patient.
The Phoenix office tested that hair thirty minutes ago.  And we got the match.
We proceed assuming she is.
Den leuten.
You were awfully good.
Oh American thank you. I like them.
Can I hear you?
I can try. Is it comedy or tragedy?
Gestern bein heurigen...
HEZT...
Holly.
I wish I knew.
Im going back home.
Hes better dead. I know he was mixed up  but not like that.
...again.
Are you going too?
...is there?
How do you know?
Oh well.
...quarrel?
Cigarette Miss Schmidt?
You know as much as I do Miss Schmidt  you were intimate with Lime werent you?
Now then Miss Schmidt Im not interested in your forged papers  thats purely a Russian case. When did you last see Lime?
Miss Schmidt we know he is somewhere across the canal in the Russian sector... You may as well help us. In a few minutes Colonel Brodsky will be questioning you about your papers. Tell me where Lime is.
There you are miss your receipt for the letters.
Where?
Im afraid Ive never heard of you. Whats your name again?
Did you ever hear of The Lone Rider of Santa Fe?
...to him.
Listen Callaghan.
What the devil?
Tactful too arent we Callaghan?
This is where he vanished.
A girl of spirit.
Didnt I?
I never knew there were snake charmers in Texas...
What time is it?
Get me Major Callaghan on the phone.
Welcome?
They wouldnt know me.
I was going to stay with him but he died Thursday.
Oh Mr. Martins good evening.
Whats that?
Well yes. I suppose that is what I meant to say.
Striptease sir.
Very popular sir.
Listen...
Listen Harry  I didnt believe that...
Part? You can have any part you want so long as you dont interfere...I have never cut you out of anything yet.
...you.
Not necessarily. Shed probably want to help.
Dr. Winkel?
Could he have been at all conscious?
Did you know Mr. Lime well?
...Popescu...
Happened...Yes happened right down there.
The Roumanian?
I thought there was something funny about the whole thing.
Look Im sorry to bother you but I was wondering if you could help me out.
Yeah just ten or fifteen dollars maybe.
Why not? Thai girls best in the world. Thai food best in the world. Thai dope best in the world.
Richard its secret. Thats the whole point.
We think in miles not kilometers.
A shark fin?
Big?
Well what the fuck do you expect me to do about it.
Well to be honest Etienne I would rather have not known about it.
What about Moliere?
Bonsoir.
Hi.
That is just the kind of pretentious bullshit that Englishmen and Americans always say to French girls so that they can sleep with them.
Too far?
But Danny if HaShem is everything and we are nothing how are we to judge His actions?
No one follows that midrash.
And you if you had come out of Egypt you would have been destroyed in the desert with those who worshipped the Golden Calf.
Whereas Avis a Zionist Nazi.
Read the early Zionists on European Jewry they sound like Goebbels.
...So she takes the pants in back  where they try them on? And I think fuck it....
Bring your friends.... Were not his friends.
Where did you read this? Robert Faurisson?
Its called the flame alphabet. Its supposed to be the word of God written in fire.
Fuck you. I hate the Jews at least as much as you do.
You write that?  Come work for me. Youve got a lot to learn I can teach it to you.
No they dont. Not the smart ones.  Look Ill give you five grand if you can document your taxexempt status.... But when you fall off this horse come see me. I can show you how to make a lot of money.
Have you read Toynbee? Spengler?
Too difficult?
Which is what?
Why no silencer?
Youre not like the others are you?... Your friends.
Too many good players down here. Im with one right now.
Bigger and better.
Whered you get this?
How come theres no punctuation?
Do you know it like that? By heart.
But you can read it the Hebrew.... Right?
Vayomer adonai el Avram lech lecha mayartzcha oomimohladtcha oombayt avaycha el haertez asher arecha...
I want to learn to read it.
Put something on. Youre not supposed to be naked in front of it.
The sex is better.
Payn tashchiton vashiytem...
Christianitys silly but at least theres something to believe in. Or not believe. Judaism theres nothing.
No I think you shouldnt.
What...? You think Im Jewish?
Believe me Adolf Hitler couldnt possibly have hated the Jews as much as I do. Not in a billion years. You know why?
He commands it whether He exists or not...  Look we can fight him and be crushed. Or we can submit.
Miriam called looking for you. She said you might come so I...
I didnt realize you cared.
Whos Eichmann?
Yes of course. But that only plays in this room with people who arent embarrassed to call themselves Nazis. If you want a modern fascism you dont mention Jews.
We want to build bridges to certain positions in the political mainstream works like iThe Bell Curvei iSociobiologyi antiZionism anti immigration the communitarian issue.... Well hold conferences invite liberals blacks Jews. Chomsky Cockburn Stanley Crouch Shahack....
Let me give you an example.... Sexuality.
Real men  white Christian men  we fuck a woman. We make her come with our cocks. But the Jew doesnt like to penetrate and thrust  he cant assert himself that directly  so he resorts to perversions. Oral sex is technically a perversion you know that dont you?  After a woman has been with a Jewish man she never wants a normal partner again. A normal man.
Who? How would I know him?
You believe that? And you call yourself a reporter?
Thats what Im trying to find out Danny. Who am I fucking with here?
But if the Jews are strengthened by hate wouldnt this destruction you speak of  by love or by any other means  in fact make them more powerful than they are already?
Did you kill Ilio Manzetti?
Its too late.... If I didnt somebody else would.  Yom Kippur starts at sundown. Will you go to synagogue?
I always won.
Which iTimesi guy?
Youre telling me you killed him? You? Killed him? Bullshit. What kind of gun did you use?
Danny Im trying to  save you.
Balint?
What part of Germany are you people from?
Without blood  a willingness to spill it  theres no real power no authority.
How have things been going?
This will be a different kind of device.
Thats all weve got left.
When do you want it to go off?
You remember Miriam....
Shes at Yale Law  interning with the district attorney...  Were getting married next spring. In Israel.
Whod you kill?
SO THEY SHOT HIM SO HE WAS DEAD. SO WHAT. HES WORSE THAN DEAD NOW. HES A PIECE OF SHIT...
Whos this?
Leary?
Adam Sandler.
After your mother died thats when you stopped going to shul. Doing your homework. Everything.
Oh fuck you...
The papers are going to report tomorrow that your colleague Curtis Zampf has been a federal informant for the past two years. Do you believe that?
Hes shy not like Enzo.
I was thinking of something kinda stupid last night.  You know those women in the greek mythology that made love with the Gods.  Take Leda for example sleeping with Jupiter who came to earth as a swan... Well can you imagine Leda announcing to her swan Youre going to be a father my little chickadee?
Johana am I boring you?
Did the driver really freeze?
My God  Im glad I didnt go.
Good afternoon.
He seems to have won it.
I tell you shes mine
Where did you two meet?
Is it a poem?
Because youd laugh.
A little... You think its the same for Jacques?
He can learn.  He is learning.
Is he alright?  What happened?
What about the shoes?
And where did you say you were from?
Whats with the voice?
I remember.  Hi Roberto
... So after all these years you must have lots of questions to ask.  Am I right?
No.
So not married.  Well good for you.  You play the field like me. A girl in every port huh?
Why?  Are they whats most important?
Youd rather think about it and make yourself miserable?
... How long was I asleep?
You were right.
No no.  Youll like it.  Its superb.
Thanks for helping with the bag.  It looks great
Yes... Maybe... I dont know.  I dont like competitions... It ruins the fun.  Dont you think?
Can I come watch you dive tomorrow?
Jacques you set a world record.
Because one shouldnt fall in love with creatures from the sea.
So have I.  ... Hello?
Well then talk to me some more.
What?
Jacques...?
... When you dive... with that machine... What does it feel like?
Why?
Assassin
What kind of name is that?  To be named after a city?
Good.  That way Ill see more of you... Where are you going to stay?
How is old Chief Bloomenbergensteinenthal? Is he still shtooping every girl he can get his hands on?
Your mother? Oh. Whoops.
Any sign of Santa?
What are we going to do? Were at least an hour from the front.
Oh my god. Shes become my pimp. And shes whoring her bitchson out to the highest bidder.
Mom I have a real job. I do good things for this community. I help people.
I dont want to argue with you. Lets just eat in peace.
Lets let your tuchus breathe.
Well I have news for you mom. It is good enough...Im good enough and I wont leave here until I hear you tell me...
Its gonna be tough but the back entrance looks like our best bet.
Man thats far out Hey the Jets won
What are you doing?
How do we bypass it?
What are you doing?
Hammer you alright?
Sorry folks I dont do couples.
Is someone with you  can I get you a drink?
Is he in love with you?
Well Charlie just why do you think your cat didnt kill the Contreras girl?
Cant make a buck without my leopard. I tell you Mr. Manning you gotta find that cat for me  or pay up.
What did they say before the bad card came up?
You and your cards. Meet a rich man I look for them with money. What rich man hasnt money. And for what was I born if it wasnt for money? Youre not telling me anything.
Well  did he give you a lot of money?
He will be waiting...
Pedro is waiting for me too.
It may sound like music to her  I can do better with my teeth in a cold Shower.  Click  click  click.
Why not? Hes a good press agent and a good friend. Besides weve shared a lot of headaches 
Oh Mr. Galbraith Im so glad youre here.
It doesnt jibe with this  you told me the leopard would go out into the country  it wouldnt stay in the city 
But it doesnt eat what it kills.
It could be a man.
Come on Charlie. Lets go find another and better suspect.
It was you.
Tell me.
What do you do now?
Well Im next. You wont hear anything like that Mr. Galbraith.  Im not a popular favorite since I let the leopard loose.
Wait 
Thats why it just mauls and tears at them.
Ive been trying to tell him Sheriff. He wont listen to me.
Get it out of here
Thats easy. Me.
Well does everybody love us now? Youve been gone long enough to softsoap twenty editors
I can use them.
That was nice of Mr. Galbraith.
And she waited here for him?
Im glad you care about us Kicks. Sometimes that gets kind of lost in the racket 
Confession. Im a complete softie. Ive been consciencestricken and worried sick ever since that leopard got away 
You already know the answer to that. I want this town to be safe and happy again 
Oh by the way  Im out of cash 
As a matter of fact Im out of cash myself.
Jerry I want you to be soft. You are soft  inside  where it matters. I wanted it that day too but didnt dare tell you.
Nobody? Huh... How come?
Haha... Yeah...  What about that road back there though? It says closed to the public doesnt it?
That might depend on where youre going.
Im afraid they are out at the moment sir.
You wouldnt recall if the brothersinlaw left together would you?
Mrs De Moraes must have taken it hard eh?  Her brothers death.
You seem surprised. Could it be you dont think that badly of him after all?  You neednt worry. It seems his motives were pure. From what I can make out he bought the boy to rescue him from further abuse.
No. The question now is how long its going to take you to get out of here Mr Lombard.
Huh Who do you think we are Mr Lombard?
You drive a hard bargain Mr Lombard.
Mr Lombard?
When did you get back?
Why did you send me after Friedman? To atone for your sins?
One just doesnt... Tell me what does one speak about huh?
A fright?... Five years of cowardice led to your brother being murdered and you wanted to give his murderer a fright?
What was the idea? Husband is filled with fear when he learns his child suppliers being tailed?
Well I hope you enjoyed yourself.
You know something? Ive just seen so much ugliness I dont think Id mind four walls and dinner served every night at a regular time.  Id hoped to have a private word with Adonis but if thats the way you want it.
They found his body yesterday. In the pool at our house in Sao Paulo. He drowned. Drank too much went for a swim and drowned.
I... We have to bury Leon tommorrow...
Theres nothing wrong with the line sir. Are you sure you have the right number? 770 471 is the number of a call box.
Good morning sir. How can I help you?
Im sorry sir. Could you try that again?
Youre sure you wont sit down Miss Stewart?
Have you never heard of collect calls Mr...
Right... Well Ill get your money first thing in the morning okay?  Okay. Goodnight then.
Look you dont tell me about some Godforsaken place where stuff so bad even I couldnt imagine it goes down and expect me to go quietly to sleep What happened? Whos the guy? The Austrian?
Friedmans dead... They killed him...
Some Italian I picked up back there. Hes in the boot of the Mustang.
Call from the motel and tell him if he moves fast enough there might be something left of a body dissolving in acid.  Can I have the keys to your house?
Look at him Whitney. Come all the way from England to clean up California. Huh
Shit Fuck Whats fucking wrong with people  Im going to bed. And sweet dreams to you to 
Why?
What sort of puppy are you looking for?
So what are you looking for?
How much of a hurry are you in?
Who are you?
I dont know. Hes gone  Hes gone. I dont fucking know where I swear... Hes gone. On holiday...
Whos the money man?
And who does Friedman work for?
Whats the Ambassador?
Im sorry but Mr Gluck is not answering sir.  Would you like to leave a message?
The Hyatt. Good afternoon. May I help you?
You sure you passed on my message?
Have you heard of a French film called La Collectionoose?
I dont know. How many famous French film directors can there be?
I came to feed your fish. I didnt know...
Id appreciate it if you could do this for me. If you cant dont worry about it. Ill call in about an hour anyway. Sorry but Im in a hurry. 
May I...?
What if it is?
So he could have decided to go on a trip...
The rooms yours for 24 hours. Its sound proofed stocked up with food drink and other things you might find useful. You can do anything you like.
Clients come and go.
Where is Friedman?
What is it?
The person who put us in touch seems to think so.
What are you going to do now? Call the police?  Take him away? I must warn you hes terrified of men so...
We didnt quite make it as lovers... Leon is a good man though...
Theyre German Jews. Came here before the war. They both lost all their families in extermination camps but they themselves never went near one. The idea that his family wealth was started with money he believes should have gone to camp survivors has been haunting Leon. Its not guilt more of a curse...  And then theres something about his parents being involved with Nazi hunters... But I think thats just one of Leons dark delusions...
Who else knows about the boy?
Is she on the phone?
Jai bien peur quil te faudra attendre.  Pas avant la matine.
Gluck.
Five seconds. Then you die.
So why didnt he?
When they realise Im missing...
Mossad?
Here... to help pay Jeannes ransom. All the Captains gave what they could as well as the citizens of Orleans and the other towns she saved...
Jean... me dear loyal Jean... why do you want to oppose the will of God?  Jeanne wanted to go to Compiegne  we let her  she got caught.  Then on my personal orders Regnault proposed 30000 crowns for her ransom and once again the answer was no.  And now you say she tried to escape and the answer is still no.  Jean open your eyes  cant you see the hand of God in all this?
I shall also be needing a war horse  mine is too slow  and armor  and a good sword  and an artist to make me a banner.
Jeanne stop it
He didnt tell you to cut all your hair off...
Not so... easily.  Why arent you... fighting...?  go on... were almost there...
Its been weeks since they spoke to me.  Since the coronation... no signs... nothing...
Thats not what I asked... Why do you want to marry me?
No but...
Did you come back to marry me or to insult me?
Jeanne... I believe in you  but can you believe in me for once? Dont go... even if you dont want to marry me.
Will you at least let me stay with you?
We must sound the retreat
Do as I say
But I promised Jeanne wed fight on
And?
No I... I held it up to...
Yes maybe... I dont remember...
Whos running this trial you or her?  I cant believe it  This wretched girl  how dare she speak to us like that?
But we cant do that unless she admits to blasphemy...
You wont be able to drag anything from her that way.  You also must realize that many of my colleagues are... well scared...
Quick  hide in here...
Oh thank you Lord  Im so glad to see you  I need to confess... I havent been confessed since Easter... or been to Mass... Will you hear me now?
The English??
Show us a little more cooperation first.  Where were you born?
Recite the Lords Prayer.
Jeanne listen to me very carefully. We are all men of faith and we shall earnestly strive for the salvation of both your soul and body as though it were our own.  We do so in the name of our Holy Mother Church who never closes her arms to those who would return to her.  But we cannot help you unless you submit to our learned judgment and authority.  Take heed of this charitable admonition for if you persist in refusing our help then we shall have no choice but to abandon you to the secular powers and I think you know well enough the punishment that would await you.  So now... will you please recite Our Lords Prayer?
What did it tell you?
I ask only one thing... to hear me in confession...
Not so well I regret to say.  This business with the Maiden... its caused him endless grief and torment.  Thats why hes entrusted me with the task of... shall we say...
Mmmm.  Yes.  I know for example the sickness that plagues your heart.  I know how painful it is for you... to have loved a father... without ever knowing if he really was yours.
Peace will only be got from the English at the end of a lance
Is it long and hanging down?
It is all his majesty can afford. He has even donated his very own personal savings.  His majesty will greatly appreciate a gesture of good will in this delicate negotiation between our two families.
May I without offending you inquire how generous?
8000.  We cant raise more... We can only place ourselves at the mercy of your generosity.
Its coming  I rode on ahead.  I have to speak with the Captain of the English army... his names Talbot...
Wait wait...
You know I feel a great sorrow for you because youre laughing now but by tomorrow night some of you will be dead and having to repeat your jokes in front of God.
Jeanne what are you doing with that... youve got it back to front...
Stand by with the batteringrams...
My lord Dunois... I have wonderful news  finally  hes sending her to us  thanks be to God  were saved  its wonderful
But... dont you think we should at least... go and... welcome her?
I do love her when her fire gets well and truly stoked
And... what does Jeanne think?
We return to Orleans... across the bridge at the Tourelles.
Jeanne... let him do it.  One more dead bodys not going to make any difference so who cares?
Bravo  What about all the other hundreds of prisoners?  Do we let them go too?
Jeanne... were not enough...
Right behind us  Dunois with another then thousand men
He never sent them... Dont you understand?  He doesnt want this war anymore... he has his crown now thats all he ever wanted...
Did your voice tell you to jump?
So when you jumped you wanted to kill yourself?
How can you deny it when you just said Id rather die than fall into the hands of the English...?
Do you not know that suicide is a very grievous sin?  No one is allowed to destroy the life that God created
You mean it was not of your own free will that you were on the ledge?
So who gave the order to bring me to this side of the river??
Jesus Christ... the goddamn English will pay for this
Physicians are a waste of time. Youll have more luck with this charm of mine... it saved my life at Agincourt
You call this... glory...?  All this... this blood... this smell of...
Jeanne... the man hasnt been paid for six months  thats his only reward.  Let him take a few teeth...
What have you done to me?
My... visions...
Yes... thats what I pray for...
What signs?
Stop stop... I cant remember  The battles were all so confusing... there was so much smoke dust noise... I was being attacked on all sides so... maybe... perhaps I fought back but it was only to defend myself...
No but... why didnt he stop it? Or did he get pleasure watching us killing each other in his name?
Let all who love me follow me... Where does God get mentioned?  Come on Jeanne be honest.  You fought for yourself in your name.
I dont agree.  Why do you have to keep changing your mind all the time?
Because... because I dont know what else to do to please him.
Theres nothing for me to do here anymore... I dont belong here I want to be with Him now...
Yes I am.
But you already confessed this morning...
Is that bad?
And what about your other friends... you dont like playing with them?
So... everything sounds... wonderful?
A beauty. Who is she?
This is my husband. Wladyslaw Szpilman. Marek Gebczynski sent him.
I nagged Jurek for weeks and weeks. And at last he gave in and said All right come with me tomorrow and so I came and they bombed the station.
Oh Mr Szpilman youre quite... quite wonderful.

Which mountains are those dear?
One day when my mother and father were singing together in the forest a great storm blew up out of nowhere. But so passionate was their singing that they did not notice nor did they stop as the rain began to fall and when their voices rose for the final bars of the duet a great bolt of lightening came out of the sky and struck my father so that he lit up like a torch... And at the same moment my father was struck dead my mother was struck dumb She neverspokeanotherword.
Well that is a strong opinion.
I got the good wife for you Peini. She pray good. Clean. Read Bible. You sleep her Peini. She chief daughter.

Cause the stoolies are used to street dicks jumpin him.  If word gets around that Feds are in on it too Gondorffll fold up the whole thing.
Hes gonna set up Gondorff for us.
Have the police got any idea where Wynant is?
Whats your next step Nick?
Why not?
Then just say he was sixty years old.
I didnt know you invented that Smelting Process.
Well
Mind if I look around?
Darling dont cry.  Please.  I know its terrible.  But isnt it really better this way?
Then what are you hiding?
Did he tell you where he was going?
Thats it...  Herbert Macaulay.
How do you do?  Im sorry we have to rush.
There. 
I dont know.
Dead?
Mothers set her heart on a big church wedding.
Yes.  And I dont want anybody to steal it from me.
I know  I know 
Like all the rest of us.  Has this fellow...  ...has he seen the whole family?
But it isnt bad weather now.
You can take that out to the car.
Did they find any clues...  a gun or fingerprints or anything?
Why not? You had a perfectly good motive.
I saw him too... he was wearing a green suit with a white tie...
Howd you people happen to pop in?
Nothing.
Ask him.  I dont know.
Have you got a pistol permit?
Whos is it?
You oughtnt to play this trick on me.  Running out when I was giving you time to rest up before I asked you those questions.
Well whatd you think?
Could this be him?
I wasnt in.  My secretary took the message.  He left word for me to meet him at the Plaza.
There are a few things we want to check up on.
You say you were in the room with the body from the time you discovered it til we came?
Are you sure you didnt leave the room...  that one of the bellhops or maids might not have been in there alone?
Thats ridiculous.
Do you think that Wynant did it?
I think we may as well sit down.
She drives me nuts.  Shes been ragging me all day.
Whos that man?
No.  I just came back for a second. I wanted to get those bonds.
Now see here Julia.  Youre counting a little too much on my being absentminded.  Youve been taking a little here and there for some time and I havent said anything about it.  But this is fifty thousand dollars
Thats my business.
Oh hello.  Come on in.
Oh please Nick.
One hundred...  two hundred... three...
Settle it yourself.  What have I got a lawyer for?
Dorothy told me you were here.  I was going to telephone but....
She usually is.  Trying one way or another to get money out of Wynant. I wanted to find out if you were er  er   sleuthing for her.
I have no right to answer that.
Oh Nick... Nick
Nick you will help me find Clyde  wont you?
But he knows you.  All you have to do is get in touch with him and tell him that Mimi says everything is all right... but that Ive got to see him.
Dorothy  Is she here?
Wheres Gilbert?
This is all very pleasant but why are here?
Oh did he?  What did he say?
Perfectly absurd.
It isnt a story  its true.  I did see Wynant.  Hes not dead.
Im lot going to stay here to be insulted  
Ive never heard about you.
Why tell me?
Whats that?
You might have mentioned me first.
Pretty girl.
Who is she?
By the way how is your fathers side?
What hit me?
Isnt that my drink?
That poor girl is in a tough spot.
Theres one coming.
On it  Im in it ... They think I did it
Finished with these?
Arent you hot in that?
Is that another Christmas present?
Nick listen.  From Clyde Wynant  Will you take charge of investigation on Julia Wolf murder. Communicate with Herbert Macaulay.
He wouldnt ask you to handle it if he were guilty.
But Wynant  ?
Whats that?  What are you up to?  Nickie  what is this?
You mean he might be hiding there?
Go on  go on  see if I care. But its a dirty trick bringing me all the way to New York just to make me a widow.
You bet I wouldnt.
I want you to stay and find Wynant.
Nick
Wynants body?
What makes you so sure its Wynants body?
What things made you so sure?
Now Nick whats that got to do with it?
Serve the nuts  I mean serve the guests the nuts.
I hope youre well.
How did you get in here?
You his wife?
Im sorry...  but...
I just wanted to tell you...
Who fired you?
Think were going to do it?  Think were going to war?
What are we going to do?
They stopped.
What if its a Valloro 69?  Just going to bounce right up out of the ground explode in the air kill him and us.
All weve got to do is make it to the top.
Not much of a pass.
The US Army  Always an adventure.
Youre the one with all the ideas.
Maybe youve got ideas of your own for the gold.  Maybe youve already got things worked out.
What happened?
Im the ones got the big stick.
Wes
Thanks for taking care of this for me.
Give it to me
Atatatatat.
Dont get pissed at me just cause I want to be ready when this war starts.
And you know what that area is?  Its Iraq.  IRAQ  Were doing a little thing with them right now Desert Storm.  Maybe youve read about it.
Now this is war.
Invest it.
Take the binoculars.
And you missed this?  How are you going to miss something like this?
You didnt step on any mine.
Howm I gonna relax standing on a mine?
Where you going?
Youre moving away because its going to blow up isnt it?  Its going to blow up
Youre going to be fine.
You dont know that.  It could be a trick.
Theyre doing more than slapping.
Not enough.  Were out numbered and out gunned.  Theyd cut us to shreds.
X marks the spot.
Where is it?  Whered it go?
What are we going to do?  What the hell are we going to do?
A whole lot of nothing.
What are you doing?
Hes not going to leave us.
Why do I have to stay down here?
We should head Northeast.
What are we going to do?  How are we going to find our way back?
Im sorry about that Epps.
Im glad I didnt have to kill you.  Im glad it didnt come to that.
Wonder how the wars going?
Getting cold.
Epps...Epps  Im gonna stop for a second.
Even if they are Iraqis probably all theyll do is take us prisoner for awhile.  Got to figure were still kicking their asses in the war.  They dont want any trouble.
What do we do?
What do you make of them?
Its always been like that.  When you left me down in the crevice to send the gold up I figured Id better...take precautions.  I rigged it to blow if anyone opened the pack.  Just in case somebody thought they could do better on their own.
Im thinking about taking a trip.
Epps I dont think hes slowing down.
Could you stop please.  Youre giving me a headache.
You get it yet?
Theyre cancelling all leaves all passes.  No more drills.  We stand at full ready starting
Jaeger?
You ever think about dying?
Epps youre smarter than this.  Jaeger I understand but youre smarter.
Were going to get court martialed you know that.
Epps is that a sand dune.
So you just let us drive on knowing we were losing fuel?  Knowing we were going to run low in the middle of nowhere?
Really?  What is that an order uprivateu?
Epps...
How long we going to keep this up.
Havent found a mine for half a mile or more.
Think we can make it?
Maybe theyre as scared of us as we are of them.
Its got a bottom.
With what?  He doesnt have a weapon.
Stress category.
4000 degrees is usually the point of....?
Im not hungry.
You know I dont feel well.
When?
Then why did you bring it up?
Look food
Now...now Im sorry...dont  dont....please.  Its just... I was happy.  Why get me involved? You told SEN that you werent satisfied with me.
Three  Im going to be late for my shift.
I cant go on like this.  I cant....  I dont just sit around and watch people.  If I make a mistake its all over.  You see it every day.  Do you want to see me taken away in pieces?
I couldnt turn you in not now. I....I know I wouldnt
THX
You always manage to avoid the issue  Whats wrong with our present condition?  Were COMFORTABLE and we have plenty of food...I feel absolutely no threat because there is no threat. Why incite trouble?  You should examine your emotions.  It is senseless...
Who?  Whos leaving?
Hes coming back for the rest of us.  He cant make it alone.
Thats the most ridiculous thing Ive ever heard.
Im sure its warmer in her than outside though.  I havent been out yet but it usually is...the control is fouled... 
Whats going on?
Im leaving.
How do you know?
Lost SEN  Hell never find us.

Yes.
Yes.
....Im taking SP5 but it doesnt seem strong enough.  I have a hard time concentrating.  Please forgive me I slipped on....

Put your arms around my neck. Lock your legs around my waist.
Here. You shoot. Ill drive.
And when might that be?
...Youre turning into quite the politician 007.
... And what do you call these?
I know my rights. These are international waters. The British Navy abandoned that boat and Im claiming it. Under international law I have the right to salvage whats on that wreck.
A dead head.  Water logged timber. Floats straight up. You sometimes see them on the east side of the channel  from the logging camps on Sumatra  but they dont usually float this far west.  Muncy Engines to half
The drill is in the water approaching the intake tunnel.
Please Sidney. Id like to remember you fondly.
Bore through.  ...They used to say living well was the best revenge Mr. Bond.  Theyre wrong.  Revenge is the best revenge.
... And theres no truth that 10 of that money will go into your Swiss bank account?
Who is that?? Whats in the box??
Your mother asked me not to mention it but your mothers birthday was last week.
When are you going to find time to help me fix the roof?
You want me to mortgage my house to invest in a scheme of yours? You know the last time we went into something together Daddy had to go in his savings to keep us from ending on the street.
Coffee is bad for anybody especially for a child.
We could borrow on that land and put the money to work.
Who is it?
Im going back home with Harry.
Im busy.
Son would you do me a favor and see if you could turn off that tap in the bathroom. My hand is too weak. And would you do me another favor? I dont like asking this but would you clean the tub for me? I have trouble bending over.
Not anymore not in the city.
He aint nothing like me. How come a man has to have sons that are day and night apart? You ought to stop protecting him.
Youre always taking his side.
Well its up to Suzie.
Do you want your coat? Its cold out here.
Since this morning.
Hes going to check out heaven first. He gets a round trip ticket to heaven. He gets in heaven and finds it just like back home. People dripping with sweat working in the fields hardly surviving. He asked a man who was getting a drink of water I thought the streets were paved with gold. They are but you wont see them he said. Boy you got to work day and night cause idleness is sinfulness. So he takes the other half of his ticket and takes the express to hell. He sees people stretched out on their backs kicking back picking their teeth. Man this is a dream. He asked Whats youll doing? They all hollered back Sinning. The devil was shaking hands with everyone and came up to him and said Please to meet you. He asked I thought youll was supposed to be burning in fire. Someone said Man aint no fire down here except under that pot of chitlins. The man was going go ask the preacher back on earth...
This is my grandson Sunny. He is my youngest sons child.
Its the boy next door throwing at his birds. Im just waiting on him to hit a pane in the window
Next time when I feel a little better perhaps.
How often is your wife called to help delivery?
My daddy called me boy up to the time he died. I was always boy to him.
Good evening. It must be all the different time zones I crossed that makes me feel this weary.
How is everybody?
Can you watch Gideon for a while? One of the girls is going into labor. Junior is going to drive me over.
I dont make no bones about where Im going to spend eternity. I have always been wild and you know that. If you are made to feel half a man what do you think the other half is?
Good God Almighty bless your bones.  But the problem grows.
Harry thats not nice. Im in church now.
I was quoting from the Bible. If the shoe fits wear it.
He should be caring. That is not too much to ask.
I cant accuse him just dry long 80.
When did you talk to Harry?
You shouldnt talk about the boys father in front of him. This is family business and we have to pull together.
Wow  Cool
Yeah
Come on down guys.  Its time for games  Weve got prizes
Can I bring some toys?
Mom  Do you know where Buzz is?
Andy  Im heading out the door.
Can I help pump the gas?
I looked everywhere honey but all I could find was your hat.
Which one can I open first?
Well lets see weve got double As 
I tell you I could fly around this room with my eyes closed
Why thank you.  Thank you all. Thank you.
Oh no no no...  Buzz look  An alien
Whats going on?
Oh.  Oh thats good.
Whats gotten into you Sheriff?  I was 
Ive set my laser from stun to kill.
Woody we dont know whats out there
Its not working.  I recharged it before I left.  It should be good for hours 
Get away  Hoocha  Hoocha
I think youve had enough tea for today.  Lets get you out of here Buzz.
Buzz  What are you doing?  I thought you were 
Woody  Its the moving van.
Nice work fellahs.  Good job. Comin out of the ground  what a touch  That was a stroke of genius.
Woody?  What are you doing?
Ahhh This is the part where we blow up
Me?  No no no no...  Are you?
Oh impressive wingspan.  Very good
Hey watch it
No no not the ear.  Gimme the nose.  Cmon
I dont know
What?
Sid give her back  Give her back now  Im telling
Huh?  Huh?  I told you he was guilty.
Im sorry.  Its just that I get so nervous before I travel.
Wait a minute.  You  you dont think I meant to knock Buzz out the window do you Potato Head?
Did you all take stupid pills this morning?  Have you forgotten what he did to Buzz?  And now you want to let him back over here?
If I send out the troops will you all calm down?
Ha ha.  Thats very funny Buzz.  This is serious
Theyre getting bigger.
What the heck is up there?
Sargent.  Establish a recon post downstairs.  Code red.  You know what to do.
Okay were on the last present now...
Oh no...its a Combat Carl.
Reach for the sky
Just gather everyone up for a staff meeting and be happy
I can manage.
Dont fret. Its only his dream. Dreams arent catching not like measles.
I want to go home.
What was ithati in aid of?
Thats your beach. This is the story. Leda walks by the shore gathering shells.  Night comes on. She hears the beating of great wings and sees the approach of the swan. She runs away but it bears down and casts her to the ground. Curtain.
Would you mind holding me in your arms for a little while?
Nothing ... You shouldnt have given Victoria that Guinness.
I already lost everything once.
But then I had a brother and a sister left.
I... I dont really know.
Anna.  Whats wrong?  What do you want?
Why does he need money?
If Manolo hadnt gone and told them what he did then Salazar and Madrigal would never have been brought to justice.  He did a great thing for Tijuana.  He did a great thing for Mexico.
Good.  From now on I want you to expect that every word you utter will be taperecorded that the movement of your lips is being read. Got it?
I dont know but under no circumstances would I talk about it here.  I want you to go home and relax the best you can.  Continue your life as if nothing has happened. That is very important.
Its the same stuff?  From the rainy day stash?
And you didnt feel like you could trust my wife with this news?
Well ground her clip her wings a bit.  School and scheduled activities and thats it until further notice. This has to be handled delicately. Dan Kelly in the District Attorneys office will probably help us out quietly.  Christ this could be embarrassing.
How long have you known?
I think we may have found our Mexican Drug Czar.  Its this General Salazar.  At least Ill have somebody on the other side I can talk to.
Because Im at the edge of my capabilities Robert.
Did you tell Dad?
You all right?
Helena 
Well get through this I promise. Ill make it up to you 
As it happens the President of the United States my new boss the leader of the free world has me penciled in for some face time.
Live with your parents?
Private?
Inhale the smoke and hold it.
No telltales.  Nothing to read. Not touching my face.  Not even blinking.  No giveaways.  Howre you feeling?
Theyre whispering.  I cant hear them but I know it.  I smell conspiracy.  I feel the lie vibrating out of the home.
Are you getting this on tape?
Remember when we sat on that mob guy that chef for like six months?
David 
Yes.
I dont know.  Eduardo Ruiz is the only real witness against Carl.  The security is very tight.  There may not be a way.
So its worth the wait right? What can I do?  Rent a Huey?  Have an airlift?  Its not like you can put it in a condom up some mules asshole right?  How many peasants would that take?  A line stretching from here to Mexico City 
Listen you motherfucker you tried to kill me with a fucking cannon.
He hired you.  That was a mistake.
Take this back with you.  Deliver it safely to Tigrillo in San Diego and we have a deal.
Relax.  If they were going to kill us they would have done it in the desert.
If you want her to stay out of it then stop telling her everything. You should learn how to keep a secret.
Please.  Filing a report will not help you find your car.
This is fucking crazy.  Instead of killing us he sends us on a suicide mission.  Do you know who Frankie Flowers is?  Hes a psychocokehead hitman.  A faggot.  Hes killed fucking who knows how many people. Youd need half the force to get close to him.  And you cant get their help because he lives in fucking San Diego.
Madrigals alive.
Whats your name?
That would probably mean the Tijuana Cartel is gaining power?
The busiest land border crossing in the world.  Over fortyone thousand vehicles per day twentytwo thousand pedestrians on foot.  I think we do a pretty good job but we know a lot of drugs are still getting through.
Who the fuck do you think you are? Where the fuck do you think you are? Why the fuck do you think I shouldnt just put you in a dumpster?
I got money.
Oh man 
I dont give a fuck about your parents 
Hey man Im sorry.  Im just trying to help.
Let me ask you a related question. Weve talked about the supply side but what about demand?  What is your policy for treating addiction?
Who are these guys?
Who do we interface with on their side?
What do we do?  Okay.  Fuckedup Bowmans turning blue.  Doctor.  We need a doctor.
Did you tell him?
Im sorry.
Well why didnt you bring them?
No I dont mean like that  I mean something nice like thats all 
Hey Im wanting a bet put on.
Two thousand one hundred and thirty three pounds.
Buy yourself that island in the sun?
Wheres that?
Do you find that this approach usually works or let me guess youve never tried it before. In fact you dont normally approach girls am I right? The truth is that youre a quite sensitive type but if Im prepared to take a chance I might just get to know the inner you witty adventurous passionate loving loyal a little bit crazy a little bit bad but hey dont us girls just love that?
Sorry.
Come on.
I dont see why not.
Calm down. Youre not going to jail.
What do you want?
Youre too young.
Its so simple. We buy it at four grand we punt it at twenty to this guy that Sick Boy knows and he punts it at sixty. Everyones happy everyones in profit. I put up two. I come away with six.
So whats he like?
Actually its a nightmare. Ive been desperate for a shag but watching him suffer was just too much fun. You should try it with Tommy.
What do you mean its gone? Where has it gone Tommy?
One of Edinburghs finest schools.
Im an old boy myself you know?
Strive hope believe and conquer.
Only to get my foot in the door. Showing initiative right?
Theres no need.
Thanks Mark.
Exactly.
Director?
Who wrote it?
Yeah.
Oh fuck. Sick Boy reaches out to Allison.
God youre sick.
I know a couple of addicts. Stupid wee lassies. I feed them what they need. A little bit of skag to keep them happy while the punters line up at a fiver a skull. Its easy money for me. Not exactly a fortune but Im thinking I should be coining it here.  Less whores more skag. Swanneys right. Get clean get into dealing thats where the future lies. Set up some contacts get a good load of skag punt it profit. What do you think?
Why would I want to sell my passport?
What?
What was your price?
Yeah. No more. Im finished with that shite.
Hes always been lacking in moral fibre.
No I dont think so.
Whats on the menu this evening?
And would sir care to settle his bill in advance?
No thank you. Ill proceed directly to the intravenous injection of hard drugs please.
Sounds great Swanney.
If Im giving up a whole day and the price of a ticket Im just saying it had better be good. Theres plenty of other things I could be doing.
Six weeks and no sex?
A walk.
Homeless people?
Qual se tu?
We sought only your infinite wisdom.
He has his doubts...
Dont tell them youre lost. Youll never live it down.
You are a master of understatement. They are likely to destroy the planet.
Can we have it quiet?
The Klingon the Romulan the Federation consuls. Now I know Enterprise is not exactly up to specs...
Where did you get this power?
I feel as if a weight has been lifted from my heart. How can I repay you for this miracle?
What is it you seek?
You told me you could have the ship operational  in two weeks. I gave you three. What Happened?
Mr. Scott apologizes for having to send the shuttlecraft. The transporter beam is nonoperational. Captain weve received important orders from Starlet Command.
Captain Starfleet transmission on line.
Captain were receiving the hostage information you requested.
Standard orbit Mr. Sulu.
Bird of Prey bearing one zero five mark two.
Goodnight Spock.
Spock what is it? Do you know this Vulcan?
I do not often think of the past.
When he encouraged others to follow him he was banished from Vulcan never to return.
Spock.
Damnit Spock. God damnit
Forgive you? I ought to knock you on your goddamn ass
You stay out of this  Why Spock? Why? I.. All you had to do was pull the trigger.
You did too. Sybok couldnt possibly be your brother because I happen to know for a fact that you dont have a brother.
There you see? See?
How do you know?
New word. b.. a... um...
...mark two.
What is this?
We must change our course at once.
What you fear is the unknown. The people of your planet once believed their world was flat. Columbus proved it was round. They said the sound barrier could never be broken. It was broken. They said warp speed could not be achieved. The Great Barrier is the ultimate expression of this universal fear. Its an extension of personal fear.  Captain Kirk I so much want your understanding. I want your respect. Are you afraid to hear me out?
No... I didnt.
You are mad



Borgus Frat.
I know youll whip her into shape Scotty. You always do.
Spock youve developed a sense of humor after all.
I know you better than that.
Sybok we must find a way...
I dont get it.
Oh my. Meanwhile kids are putting eight million quarters a week in Space Paranoids machines and Im not seeing one dime.
Dillinger?
Not if my Tron program was running. That would seal the system off. If your files in there...
Shouldnt you wait till your lawsuits settled?
Flynn had Group 7 access.
I want to go to his place.
I dont think Im cleared for this.
Ever since he got that Master Control Program set up systems got more bugs than a bait store.
Come on in...
Well I dont know...I just tried to run this program Ive been working on and I was denied access all of a sudden. I thought maybe Id been laid off and nobody told me.
You said it.
It shouldnt be any harder than General Motors was. But now...this is what I get for using humans.
That was uncalledfor.
Yes?
Dumont... my User has information that could  could make this a free system again.
Flynn
Hey... you guys OK?
Hey Ram ... what were you ... you know before?
He was disoriented in transport Tron.
Hey Good to see you guys Nothing classes up the place like a cleancut young couple.
A User?
Well I  its just  I dont know a User I mean... Users wrote us. A User even wrote you...
Butwhat if I cant...?
Yes and now youve got two renegade programs running all the hell over the system in a stolen simulation.
You think we can make it there?
Do you know what hes talking about?
Yori... hey...
What is it?
Are you kidding?  Harry had to go out of town.
Can you cover me for an hour?
Where are you going?
You seem fine now.
Dana are you listening to me?
How was school today?
Dad how come you know the words?
And this is a little above market rate for the horizontal bop even for a total biscuit like her.
Uh huh.  Right here in river city.
And the second you left there we started getting calls to the ghost numbers.  They were checking out the Renquist front.
Copy that.
Abu Kaleem Malik.
Look uh... Ive got to talk to Helen about this thing with Dana. Im just going to run in and see if she can get away for lunch.
Just hang a minute.
Nobody believes it can happen to them.
Same thing happened to me with wife two.  I had no idea until I came home and the house was empty.  I mean empty.  She even took the icecube trays from the fridge.  What kind of person would think of that?
Is this national security stuff boring you?
Whatre you talking about?  We have that.
Yeah and we do it twenty times a day.  Dont give me that crap. Just put on the taps.  Now.
Now what?
I thought this look like your work.
you tell the son of bitch this is  Bright Boy Alert.  Repeat a Bright Boy Alert.  And I need a patch of the White House ASAP. Thats right
Hes got it.
My husband is a good man.
God  You have no idea how much that turns me on.  Ive never had the courage to say this before but... I love you Janice.
So your clients want something for the lobby of their new corporate headquarters?
Lets see... that you can read ancient Sanskrit without having to sound out the words.  And that other dealers and archeologists dont like you much.
Howd it go at the trade show? You make all the other salesmen jealous?
What did you tell him?
I need you to talk to Dana.  The vice principle called and she cut class again this afternoon.
Look I know youre upset.  Im really sorry honey.  I raced home as quick
Come on to bed you dont have to brush your teeth.
Not because you were attracted to him?
Tell me about your husband Mrs Tasker.
This Simon.  Did you sleep with him?
My husband cant know about this.
I can do it
So last night was pretty exciting huh?
What did he give you?
I dont take those assignments.
Tell me something before this stuff wears off and you start lying again.
As much as you used to?
Oh shit.
Its killer.  Look at me Im not that much to look at.  No really.  I can be honest.  But I got em lining up and not just skanks either.  Some are.
Exactly.  The trick is you gotta pick your target.  They have to be nice little housewife types. Schoolteachers.  But Im telling you you get their pilot lit these babes they can suck start a leafblower.
What does she do?
See.  You and this car were meant for each other.  Why fight it? Sure I have a couple other buyers lined up but I like your style.  Whattya say?  Should we start on the paperwork?
Yeeaoowww
Boris and Doris?
Look Harrys not part of this. Hes just a sales rep.
Whats going on Harry?
Now just keep your knees together and youll be fine.
Right of course.  I was worried when I didnt hear from you that night.
You can call me Simon.  Youre very brave to do this...  You opened it.
What do you want me to do?
Gotten your mail yet?
Youre gonna be on T.J. Hooker?
The letter I sent.
Has he looked through it yet?
Oh look what happened. Oh god Im so sorry. Are you OK?

When he was alive. I wouldnt fuck him now.
I grow it on my windowsill. The lights really great there and Im up high enough so you cant see it from the street.
Duh. What else would I be talking about? Now stop askin stupid doorknob questions. Well a year and a half ago this friend of mine got access to the evidence room for an hour. He snagged this coke. But hes a good cop with a wife and a kid so he sat on it for a year and a half until he found a guy he could trust.
We were in Four H together. Weve known each other since childhood. So Im handling the sales part. Hes my silent partner and he knows if I get fucked up I wont drop dime on him. I didnt tell you nothin and you didnt hear nothin.
Elliot.
No. Not yet.
It tried to pin down what the attraction is after all these years. It covers the whole spectrum of fans the people who love his music the people who grew up with him the artists he inspired  Bob Dylan Bruce Springsteen and the fanatics like these guys. I dont know about you but they give me the creeps.
But the bottom line is Im not Paramount. I have a select group of distributers I deal with. I buy their little movies. Accomplish what I wanna accomplish end of story. Easy businesslike very little risk.
You like a little coffee with your cream and sugar?

Gangster. Drug Dealer. Somebody you dont want on your ass. Look Clarence the more I hear about this Drexl fucker the more I think you did the right thing. That guy wasnt just some wild flake.
Thanks a lot Daddy. You really came through for me.
Could I have one of those Chesterfields now?
Yeah and the restaurants on my route. And you know I stuck my nose in for the company to try to put a stop to some of these breakins. Now while I have no proof the name Drexl Spivey kept comin up Whos case is it?

Well?
We want tough minded people.  Strong mentally.  Weve had some...misfortunes with unstable types.
Were very close  Because of you
I told you that fuckhead Mason would get us into something like this.
Wow a guy in a Chevy is chasing her and some other guy I cant see.
Lets consider again our current information  if the symptoms were first detected in Philadelphia on June 28 1995 that makes us know that...?
To find out where the virus is so a qualified scientist can travel back into the past and study the original virus.
Mr. Cole?  My name is Doctor Railly. Im a psychiatrist.  I work for the County  I dont work for the police. My only concern is your well being  do you understand that?
July.
What year do you think it is?
It was some lady.  She didnt know anything.
Its just a shot to calm you.
Did something terrible happen to you when you were a child?  Something so bad...?
You were in my dream just now.  Your hair was different but Im sure it was you.
About an airport...before everything happened.  Its the same dream I always have  the only one.  Im a little kid in it.
What do you mean  when you were a kid?
Mason???
All I see are dead people.  Everywhere. Whats three more?
What made you think that?
I want to be here.  In this time.  With you.  I want to become...become a whole person.  I want this to be the present. I want the future to be unknown.
You... you couldnt have heard me.
I have seen it but I dont remember this part.  Funny its like whats happening to us like the past.  The movie never changes  it cant change  but everytime you see it it seems to be different because youre different  you notice different things.
Does this bother you Mr. Cole?
Who would you call Mr. Cole who would straighten everything out?
Why dont I escape thats what you were going to ask me right?  Cause Id be crazy to escape  Im all taken care of see?  Ive sent out word.
Never saw him before in my life.  Go ahead and shoot him or torture him or whatever it is you do.
Me?  Are you kiddin?  Youre the one You were a hero man.  They gave you a pardon  And whadda you do?  You come back and fuck with your teeth  Wow
The phone call man.  The phone call.
What virus are we talking about Dad?

Whatd you think I was doing out here with these glasses on?  Sunnin myself?
I think youd better give your pooch a sip.  He looks sick.
You sure seen a lot for a blind man.
Maybe I do.
I think Ive heard that before.
The day wasnt so bad.  We all got through it all right.
Ill take a piece of that bet. I say it doesnt come up five times each side.
Hundred and eight aint a hundred and thirteen.
A coins got two sides.  When you flip it theres a fiftyfifty chance itll be heads or tails.  Boyd thinks if you flip a coin ten times half the time itll come up each side.
But in particular?
We have a bus to Mexico.  Arrives in two hours.  Have to make a couple of connections but it will get you across the border.
One way or round trip?
I bought a beer.  That was two fifty.  I bought a beer otherwise I would have thirty.
You want somethin?
Then why do you call it Harlins?
Thatll make five in a row.  Never seen it so hot.  Sometimes I dont even want to get out of bed.  Id rather just lay there and try to catch a breeze.  I was in Mexico this one time
Its your radiator hose.  Its busted.
Well you know so much why dont you just fix it yourself?
What time is it now?
Nothing.
Thats a Ford not a Ferrari.  You going to tell me no one else in this shit hole drives a Ford?
It might as well be fifteenhundred dollars because I dont have the money.
You think bad and bad is what you get.
No
Goddamn you  You son of a bitch
Were closed.  Come back in the morning.
I dont want no dirty money.  I run an honest business.
What was that all about?
You never said anything.  About the drapes.
Can I give you a hand beautiful?
Jesus.
Good luck it didnt happen a few miles back.  Maybe they never would have found you.  Day like today youd be dead for sure.
Youve been around.
You just travel around no direction no steady work.  You must like taking chances.
What do you do anyway?
I think I can find my own way back to into town.
Did you ever?
He doesnt give it to us.  We take it.
Lied?  What do you mean?
Its not a combination lock.  It takes a key.  He keeps it on him all the time.  I mean all the time.  It scratches up against me when we do it.
Shit
Why?  Am I making you hot or does the truth scare you?
Wheres the safe?
John?  What the hells the matter with you?
I got the money all packed.  I put the jeep in the garage.  Figure that way people will think maybe me and Jake went away.  Might buy us some time.
Had push it in.  Funny thing it wouldnt start.
John . . .?
He was going to take the money.
The police dont know that.  And its going to be hard to explain it to them with a noose around your neck.  Ill take you as far as California.  If we can even make that.  After that Im cutting you loose.
Why?  So when the cops catch up with us you can try and sell me out again?  You take your hald of the money and run.  You might want to try Mexico.  With all that dough youll live like a queen.
John
Its . . . its locked.
John if you dont throw me the keys then Ill just walk away. Walk away and leave you here.
Who the hell are you?
Youve got to be
Live there?
Im not a murderer Mr. McKenna.
Good Lord.  What happened to you?
Another accident?  Youve really got to be more careful.  Can I get you a drink?
Hungry?
Now what can I do for you?
Youre the one who brought it up. This morning.  In your car.
Lets say I do want her dead.  What is it you want?  This morning you werent a killer.
And for that youd kill Grace?
You drive a hard bargain but I had a feeling you were my boy when I met you.
This is what you do  Go to the house to see her.
You know what I mean.
Shut up.
You think thats a lot of money?
Thats not the reason Im here.  I swear it.
I came for Grace.
I came to kill her.
Then maybe this afternoon.  When I sent you to kill my wife you ended up sexing her instead.

Toby Tyler it dont matter to me if you beat him all up and knock out all his teeth and hes just drooling and bleeding all over hisself cause we love each other and we gonna run off and Im gonna have his love child.
Youre fucked.
Theyre not very imaginative?
I wasnt hitting on your girl
Thats right Mister.  You better be afraid.  I told you it wasnt over but you didnt listen.  Now I find you sneakin around with my girl behind my back.

Whatd you think I was doing out here with these glasses on?  Sunnin myself?
Change?  You want my change?  I fought the war and lost my eyes just so I could give you my change?
Oh Jesus.

I thought you said you lost your eyes in the war?
Afraid of it?  Boy I live in the dark. All cause of a woman who made me this way. People are afraid of what they cant see. I cant see nuthin so its all the same to me.  Kiss from a beautiful woman kissy kissy kiss a lick from a dog slurp slurp the kiss of death . Its all the same to me.

You cant just walk in here and walk out you sonufabitch Im gonna tear you a new asshole
Im a solid man.
Hey
She does at that.  I knew when I married her she was a free spirit.  A woman with her looks and a man my age what was I to expect?  But you see a woman like that in a town like this and you dont think you do. So I married her.  What are you to do eh? Women.
Ive done a few things but Im not a murderer Mr. McKenna.
You said youd cut that up with the man who did her in.
Dont play simple with me Jake. Youre a betting man. You want me to spell it out for you? Ill kill Grace if you cut me in on the money.
Well then I guess that qualifies me for citizenship in this town. Youre the one brought it up. This morning. In your car.
Bullshit.  You wanted me to kill her.
You meant it.
Because youre a slimy bastard who would have his wife killed just to get his hands on some money.
How the hell should I know?  Ive never had a wife killed before. Jesus Christ uYouu want this job you dont know how to do this? I guess I should have hired a professional.
Next time youll do just fine.
You have a lot of talk in you whole lot of talk.
How the hell did you know where the bedrooms at?
Twohundred dollars?
You aint from Oz.  Oz is in that movie.
If I could do you think Id be standing here wasting my time.  Can you fix it or do I have to go somewhere else?
Okay Im stuck.  You happy?  Now can you fix it or not?
Accident.
Im very interested in this but is there someplace...
Nothing.
Just banged my head.  It was an accident.
A goddamn radiator hose in a sixtyfourandahalf Mustang.  You know how long it took me to find that hose?
Hey there.  I was beginnin to think you wasnt comin back...  You dont look so good.
Hell Ive had days I would gladly trade with a whippin dog.  Aint much you can do when you feel like that cept tough it out.
Its going to cost you twohundred dollars.
The goddamn sign on the wall. I cant do unauthorized work?  What am I suppose to do? Just let you ride out of here with a bad gasket.  Then you get in an accident and get killed.  Or worse.  Who they gonna blame then?  They gonna blame me and there goes my reputation.
Got any cold soda?
Its very nice of you to help me.  That package is kind of heavy and its so hot.
Wasnt nothing.
Where you headed?
So what is it you do Mister...?
I guess.  Ive got an ego same as any man.
Whered you learn to do that?
You flirt with me then you run cold.  You lead me on then slap me down.  I dont go for being jerked around.
You love him?
Did you ever?
Im guessing no.
I take it things didnt much work out the way you planned.
I dont know how.
It takes a key.  He keeps it on himself all the time.  I mean uall the timeu.  It scratches up against me when we do it.
Grace ... Grace?

Dont you want to know...? I bet its burning a hole in your brain just now?
Hope is a fourletter word.
Morning officer.

A boy came across a body on the beach this morning. Thrown clear when the boat burned. Shot once in the head. Two guys from the F.B.I. just identified him.                     
Not dope. Something else. Some what?.. He doesnt knob what they were buying. But not dope... people.
Dont give up on me now Dean.

He wont go into the interrogation room.
No no no no no.
Thats crazy Dave and it doesnt matter. He has total immunity and his story checks out. He doesnt know what you want to know.
Verbal I know you know something. I know youre not telling us everything.
Sure. Fifteen years ago but he was a good thief Anyway the cops wouldnt let him go legit.
He wasnt behind anything. It was the lawyer.
You tell me Agent Kujan. If I told you the Loch Ness Monster hired me to hit the harbor what would you say?
That was how I ended up in a barber shop quartet in Skokie Illinois.
Youre stalling Verbal.
Then what?
What call?
I WAS AFRAID OKAY? Somehow I was sure it was Keyser Soze at that point. I couldnt bring myself to raise my gun to him.
I dont buy that reform story for a minute. And even if I did I certainly dont believe he would send you to protect her. So why?
NO NO NO NO NO.
My client offers his full cooperation in these proceedings. In exchange his testimony is to be sealed and all matters incriminating to himself are to be rendered inadmissible.
Counselor I will prosecute your client.
What did he find?
He was accused of jury tampering.
... heres your mail call Mrs. Doneghy ...
You know what that would mean?  To get somebody from a Boston hospital to say hell testify?
Say it.
You were the anesthesiologist at her delivery May twelfth nineteen seventy...
Its a common medical expression its a crash program to restore the heartbeat.  Dr. Marx cut an airway in her trachea to get her oxygen her and the baby...Ms.Nevins...
Engaged to render an opinion.  For a price.  Is that correct?  Youre being paid to be here today?
Yes weve heard that.  Doctor you testify quite a bit against other physicians?  Isnt that right? You youre available for that? When youre paid to be there?
Mr. Concannon...?
No further questions.
Thank you your Honor.  We object to the copy of the admissions form as incompetemt and essentially hearsay evidence and cite McGee versus State of Indiana U.S. 131 point 2 and 216 through 25 of the Uniform Code  The admission of a duplicate document in preference to an existing original must presuppose the possibility of alteration and so must be disallowed.  And your Honor having given the Plaintiff the leeway we would like your ruling on this issue now  we object to the admission of the Xerox form.
The document is disallowed the jury will be advised not to consider the testimony of Kathy Costello regarding the Xerox form.    Its unsubstantiated and we  cant accept a copy in preference to the original...
Then please which is correct? Youve sworn today the patient ate one hour ago.  Four years ago you swore she ate nine hours ago? Which is the lie.  When were you lying?
Thats not my handwriting.
And why please tell us would you think that?
You said youre gonna call me up. You didnt call me up.  Who do you think you are?    Who do you think you are...?
I am on the staff of...
I...given the limits of your question thats correct.
Im going to take you to the home to see the girl...
Dr. Thompson.  From your review of the hospital records of May twelfth nineteen seventysix.  In your opinion what happened to Deborah Ann Kaye?
Now Dr. Towlers testified that they restored the heartbeat within three or four minutes.  In your opinion is his estimate correct?
And you wrote that...
Yes.
Yes.
Uh ... in the well in the interests of her family ... you Dr. Gruber you know you can never tell what a jury is going to do. St. Catherines a very well thought of institution.  Her doctors ...
We have to ... we ... we have to keep you under wraps.  Please dont dont discuss ...
Who are you protecting then?
Yessir.  Im sorry.
...thats true.  Sometimes they change sometimes they dont. Now I remember back to when you were disbarred...
I had a witness disappear on me.
I could subpoena him if I had a week.
Do we have time this morning to... All right.  Mr. Galvin you want to continue now or we can resume with Dr. Thompson this afternoon.
Sustained.  Yes.  The witness will confine his testimony to review of the hospital records.
Yes Mr. Galvin?
Listen to me fella...
Mr. Galvins...
Pardon?
Really.  How wonderful for you.
Jimmy  Thats why the court exists.  The court doesnt exist to give them justice eh?  But to give them a chance at justice.
Why dont you get some rest?
You want me to tell you its your fault?  It probably is.  What are you going to do about it?   I thought its not over till the jury comes in.
Maybe Ill tell you later.
Not if you dont grow up...
No no no.  I have to talk to him.  If I can only call him..
I have to talk to you.
Admittance form is wrong.
Ive got my Dr. Gruber says her heart condition means they gave her the wrong anaesthetic anyway plus she came in complaining of stomach pains...
Mary Rooney fortynine.  Lives in Arlington still working at the hospital.  Can you get out tomorrow?  How come she isnt speaking up.
Okay now.  Cases  Smith versus State of Michigan.
So what?
What Im saying theyre getting some help.
Thats right.
Who?  Theyre all testifying. Everybody who was in the O.R.s going to take the stand.
...four years ago...
... Im sure you do ...
... I understand ...
What does it mean?    I...I mean we you have other tactics...
I just saw her.
Thank you.
Who told you that?
Kathy Price...
You were the Admitting Nurse at St. Catherine Laboure Hospital on May twelfth nineteen seventysix the night Deborah Ann Kaye was admitted...

The floor was wet. She slipped

If Im the king of Israel I say to myself King I say to myself King... Take a good look around. What do I see?
I say to myself look at the map. Look whats all around you. People who wish bad bad things for you and your people. For thousands of years the Jews are fighting everybody. It used to be theyd throw rocks then the iron revolution and they would attack with spears. Then the gunpowder revolution. Now theyre shooting fire power back and forth all day bullets flying babies getting shot.
Now if Im the King of Israel and all these sand niggers are armed to the gills and you know its just a matter of time ...right? Am I right?

Mike Brenn. Yes. Yes. 14.3 at 7.5 for 6. At 29.83 at 9.  Im amazed the windows dont blow out of their fucking sockets with all the repressed asspuckering rage in these soulless lizards.

The way she looked at me Ramona She hates me now. I think Ive made a great mistake. Shes going away shes going away and nothing will stop her.
Dont lie. You dont believe me either.
It wont take but a minute. Its a votive offering for a lady who was cured just when she was dying of fever. Our Lady of the Helpless granted her a favor.
Not in that way youre always looking for company.
So Ramona

Hey the door was open.
Sell?
I told you not to go into that racket. You couldve been a doctor or a lawyer
you coulda stayed at Bluestar and been a supervisor in instead of going customer relations by now stead of going off and bein a salesman.
You get on the phone and ask strangers for their money right? Youre a salesman.
Its yourself youve got to be proud of Huckleberry how much ya need?

Dad you know Duncan Wilmore pilots union and Toni Carpenter flight attendants...
Dad Im going to jail and you know it.
What if he asks where I got the money?
Didnt he tell you?  Thats so like Gordon. Get dressed were going out.
Fox Bud D. is this deja vu or has it really been a year. Youre not hitting me up for NYU are you?
Within 45 seconds a microprocessor computes your systolic and diastolic pressure. Has an LCD readout and its cost effective  less than one visit to the doctor.
So what firm you with pal?
...A cosmetics company by any chance? What are you the 12th man on the deal team? The last to know?
...dont like airlines lousy unions...
My home numbers on the back...
See this? Can you believe it? Two inch screen...
Mr. Gekko  thank you for the chance. You wont regret this youre with a winner.
I guess your fathers not a union representative on that company.
Know the name?
Revenge is a dish best served cold... well its payback time sport.  ... see that building? I bought into it ten years ago. It was my first real estate deal. I sold it a couple of years later and made an 800000 dollar profit. It was better than sex. At that time I thought that was all tne money in the world...  Now its a days pay ... I had a mole in Wildmans employ. Gave me half the picture then he got fired...
Ill be right there fix them a drink.
The break up value is higher. Its worth 80.
Gordon what I wantand I never asked you for anythingis to be your copilot on this. I want to take this airline turn it around and make it work. Its gonna make us a fortune
I can talk to these people Gordon they trust me...and my father can be a big help in getting cuts.
What the hell do you want?
Hello Bud.
Sure you could in Wildwood New Jersey. If you sold this  you could have a pretty nice penthouse on Fifth. But you wouldnt have much left over for decoration.
Not really. Id say that Gordon is one of the most astute collectors around. He has a great eye and he only buys the best. Like this rug for instance a silk Tabriz the finest of its kind. The day after he bought it in London a dealer representing the Saudi Royal Family offered him twice what he paid. It absolutely makes the room. See how this little bit of celadon in the border is picked up in the cushions oh the sofa... although...  I dont know if I would have used that tea dipped linen for the upholstery  too dingy. And its a sacrilege having that PreColumbian pot in the center of the coffee table. Some dope might use it as an ashtray.
You have modest wants. I like that in a man.
I love you baby. Did I tell you that sometime in the last 24 hours?
How you doing Buddy?
Bud Where you been the last two days?
Mr. Mannheim got a sure thing.  Anacott Steel.
Sorry to hear that. I thought the kid had staying power.
I want to ask you a big favor Gordon. Please drop the Bluestar deal.
Yeah Billy whos your buyer?... No not interested.  Ollie start calling a the institutions start with Marx at Janson Mutual then Reardon. Get me that California retirement money baby And were on our way
Listen you clowns theres somebody else out there trying to buy your airline if you want to be Pacmanned and gobbled by Atilla the Hun be my guest
He still likes you
He did?
Whats that?
Anybody want another drink?
Us is over.  You had your chance you blew it.
Your books Master Loftmore
She went to a waxwork party
Wooo.  Jealously rearing its ugly head.

Something was there.  You saw it.

Jody she tried to kill him.

You did a great job.  Shes a good kid.
Tired?
Maybe we should just...
Why?
...when tonight theyll probably be keeping us awake.
What are you doing here?
Think I may have cracked it.
And he says...youll fucking love this he says Doctor Spencer I am a great admirer of your work...
He killed her.
He did.  Shes in the picture.  I went over to look and shes gone.  The table was set for one.
When?
What are you doing?
I never said...
Who did?
Sabotage?
Maybe youre right.  Maybe Im losing my mind...
You dropped a glass.
You shoved me away and ran out to the patio.  I took you home.
I thought it was Mrs. Feur but its not...
I dont like this this...
I think shes starting to suspect something.
I never asked you to quit
She was damaged and unstable.  The more I tried to distance myself the more desperate she became.  Finally she showed up at the new house...
Look for antiques...
Adamant.
Would you stop it
Youve always said you felt goodness in them  that the witches brought you and Rowan together.  Isnt that right...?  Theyre reaching out to you Rowan

But my mother...  Ellie said she died 
You can see well in the dark Rowan.
Lasher touched you and you loved it.

But I could understand. I want to understand
You mustnt hurt him. Mustnt  mustnt hurt..
Only you...

No
Aaron was in the dream.  A dream tilled with spirits.   you killed him didnt you...?
Rowan and I will be together now. My time has come.  Your time is gone.

HARDER
Oh. The Green underwater Ghosts...  The Man With The Eyes In His Hands...
Im serious.  You dont 
Rowan...?
Everyone  this is Michael curry.
Either do I.    I love you Ro.  You know that. Youre a total mystery to me  but I love YOU. 
Smoking is bad for your heart Michael.
Dovetails.  Gotta be a hundred years old.

This must be one of the old keys 
Oh  Tell me ELLEN I can call you ELLEN?
Oh anywhere  whenever I needed to  Do you know how easy it is to take them? You just pick up a hiker or someone off the streets  they believe so easily you know Look I have something to show you I would say  and that would be it. One girl I think her name is Debbie  she had broken down on the motorway and I offered to take her to a service station to call for a tow truck  She just got in and I drove away. When I pulled into the layby and took out my knife  she just froze and said  what do you want?  I said You know what I want.  But she didnt. Getting rid of the bodies is just as easy  the first I cut up put in bags with bricks in and tossed them off Eldridge Bridge in broad daylight.  The real problem with my work is the blood  there is so much of it  and it all spurts out so fast  like a fountain. It made such a mess of
What did you do with her?
How long have you been watching me?
then why did you marry her 
You are the first person I have ever told any of this to. We are birds of a feather ELLEN...were in the same league
You think I killed my MOTHER dont you?
No...I didnt do it...I wish I had but I didnt. I was beaten to it. STEPHANIE became my mother.
What?
Yes...
But ELLEN I told you I have stopped...
ELLEN would you like a cup  theres plenty in the pot
Its not that  I just dont want any sugar
Whats wrong with you?
You dont own him you know  you cant tell me not to see him
Is LESLIE here?
As it happens I was at home alone  maybe we could solve each others problems?
Thats good
Think about it...Long tunnel bright lights its full of vaginal symbolism.
This is the life baby. We get ourselves some tail and were talking SPRING BREAK
You kiss your mother with that mouth?
A couple of boys fighting over a pair of red silk panties is nothing compared to what hes seen.
Youll never believe whos in there.
Holy stinkers what were you thinking?
Naked girls wild sex video games. No wonder its called Heaven.
Never say never.
If it isnt straight by now son you probably should see a doctor.
Not bad for a hack. He has a future in yellow journalism.
Wouldnt it be awesome if we were about to say the exact same thing?
Well. The proms coming up.
And I was wondering.
Teddy? Would you please please please take me to the prom?
Oh Ted DUH.  I smile at everyone since I got my braces off.
You really dont get it do you? I am genetically programmed to desire a big buff manly man who can defend and provide for me and my yet to be conceived offspring Its like a caveman thing
I thought Id be nervous but you sure know how to make a girl feel relaxed Teddy Bear.
I was always too shy to admit how much I liked you.
God you are so hot.
We have a truckload of strawberries arriving on Tuesday morning.
Were not ashamed of you Teddy. We dont approve of the magazine or the models or the socalled flesh parties you attend. But we can get past all that.
I remember spring break of my senior year.  Seems like a lifetime ago.
Grandpa was so strong back then. Working from the crack of dawn. So proud of his peaches.
Son.
Think of it as a rite of passage to manhood.
Whatever helps you cope.
Ted its your dad.  I have a question for you.  I dont know how to put it tactfully. You know Im lousy with words.
But those are our dreams son. We have to make them come true.
Hey Ted. Wanna go shopping?
Dont worry.  He found the chocolate room.
Or do you have a taste for the good life Ted? Its in your blood.
After graduation...maybe we could go away together?
Ted Do something
Theyre not my parents Helen. My parents are back in Xenia and I hurt them very much.
And the girl I love she hates Heaven. If I keep it shell never respect me.
Matter of fact Jay my uncle and I are planning to rethink the magazine. To expand the traditional western notions of beauty.
Sheryl Petersen is what nine years old what does she know?
Mom and Dad said its yours. They seem to think youre coming home.
Youre a peach.
But just for the record my Mom is a kickass schoolteacher and my Dad is the best damn auto mechanic this side of the Himalayas. You seem to have forgotten they opened Nelsons FAMILY Market so they could build something permanent a legacy for us. Their kids.
Great.
I tried to warn you William Randolph. Shes got stiletto heels hidden in those Keds.
What is it William Randolph? Your balls need scratching?
In what sense?
Im still better than you. Nothing changed except the decimal point in your savings account.
I dont get the distinction.
I felt limited. I felt confined. I felt like I was suffocating.
She said peanuts you cretin.
Funny you should say peachy.
Considering this is your first time on a private jet on which you are interviewing the worlds most eligible bachelor  you are extremely cavalier.
Why cant you be nice to me?
Wow...you clean up nice.
I feel like Im being drawn and quartered. Like every part of me is being pushed and pulled and tugged in a different direction.
Even when you infuriate me I still want to kiss you.
A good journalist can take lemons and make lemonade. Im honing my craft.
That has more to do with your proximity to me.
Shoes if you want to know the truth. Shoes are my thing.
My fantasy is a totally naked woman wearing nothing but a Timex and suede clogs.
A Portuguese boyfriend. Sounds very Cosmo.
I mean your pictorial. It bothers me profoundly.
Im all right Mom. Im not in Siberia you know.
Well? Surprised?
Oh good lord. Are those Neptunes?
Everything I am is because of you. Can you ever forgive me?
I need your help.  Im really in deep shit.
Ill be blunt. I know you can take it.
Thats a good start yes. A very good start.
Come on its our only senior prom.
Im warning you.
You do like girls dont you?
A lot? I mean a whole lot?
Ah in other words this is the apresorgy salon?
Truth is Im a little nervous.
All those people out there. Its a lot of pressure.
I do?
Youre the Sultan of Semen. The Monarch of Masturbation. The Merchant Prince of Lust. You. Ted. Are the King of Coitus.
Well...for one thing...I think its despicable that we exclude so many women that only fit our western notion of classic beauty.
The world is a big beautiful place.  We can open new markets in Africa and Asia.  Imagine the Dali Lhama reading our magazine.
So far so good. Some of them have real Angel potential.
Such enthusiasm. Have I told you lately how proud I am of you?
Yes?
Thanks for teaching me an important lesson. What makes a family is love not blood.
Youve got the wrong guy. The closest my parents have been to the Amazon is the Brazilian pavilion at Epcot.
How quaint.
All I can tell you Sam is hang in there.  They clear you of this mess you get reinstated with back pay...
Is that Sandra Van Ryans kid?
Shes going to wash your Jeep?
Ray.  Stop calling.  I told you the dental records will take time...
Wasnt enough Van Ryan had to destroy the people who invested here.  He got to be old he and his rich cronies would come down here hunt and whore act like assholes.  One trip he showed up with this young girl hed picked up somewhere gotten her pregnant then dumped her in the swamp.  That came with her.
They were in me.  Both places... you know.
Then what?
How long?
Maybe she used another name.
Ive got that two oclock in town.
Its our job Gloria.
You can go up to one of those trees and peel the bark.  You know what you get? More bark.  And more bark.  Theres no core.  Trees not good tar anything but sucking up water.  And now they cant get rid of them.  Theyve tried poisons. Nothing works.  They dont die.
You remember that little girl walked out of our talk at Blue Bay?
Think back before the suit was filed before the trial.  Lombardo had an affair with Sandra right?  So why not tell us about the affair?  I mean it could be a hell of a motive for Kelly to fabricate her charge in the first place.
Which she might have saved if she hadnt set out to destroy the mans life.
Its starting Gloria.  This is how it begins...
Im gonna take you back to the office. Will you put out a call on Suzies car for me?
If you want company...
Two kids couldve gotten into a fight lost a couple of teeth.
Poor dumb Suzie she never had a chance.
Im tired Ray.  Im going home.
About a year ago.
No.
I want a fullscale investigation.
Or maybe she thought that was what she wanted and she got a little more than she bargained for...
Ray.  The conversation on this tape is totally unintelligible.  What we have here is you on the Van Ryan property without a proper warrant shooting a porn flick...
I told her I was coming with her.  She nodded like she understood.  We stood up together.
He pushed into me... I couldnt stop him... it hurt.
Ms. Toller?
Come on.  Beats study hall doesnt it?
Way I hear it he was pretty tight with the kids one of the guys...
Will you calm down.  Duquettes gonna come to you just like he did to me. Youre gonna have to be ready for him.
Anybody ever tell you that stuff will rot your brain?
Is that Sam Lombardo?
Which one of your bodyguards is that?
Kelly.  What is it?
Dont bother.  Im taking a trip.
All right.  Ill have to look for it.
Shit.  I was afraid of that.  She left this garbled message on my machine.  Can you calm her down?
Im running away.
Yeah theyre bad for your health.  Im tryin to look out for you...
Well youre half right.  Best thing you could do for yourself right now would be to talk to me.
Every triangle Ive ever seen never lasts.  Somebodys got to go.
You Kelly Sam.
You... I shouldve killed you myself. should never have left it up to him...
Yes.
But you do admit to touching her to putting your arm around her.  Isnt that against the rules?
Yeah well you fixed that.  What the hell happened anyway?
You mean this thing?
But I..
Yeah right.
But then you knew what he was like all along... Maybe his killing Kelly was a thing you had counted on...
Why dont you come in have a drink?
Sorry Sandy.  Ive got plans.
Grab a clue Sam.  Youre a hired hand around here.  Enjoy it while it lasts.
Attractive buttons yes?  But yank one off toss it and poof  It emits a cloud of sleeping gas.
Good Lord man.  The world is changing.  And mark me it is always the criminal mind that is the first to exploit modern invention.  We as defenders of the right must keep pace
Yes aha.  A brass screw.
Doyle once around the park.  I need a moment to prepare.
Doctor V. L. Pemberton.  I knew it.  Hes a scientist all right. Inventor of the Pemberton Condensed Steam Engine.  Im telling you Artemus Loveless is our man.
All that jumping and kicking.
Damn it this is ridiculous.
Jim are you all right?
Well... that too.
So... what happened?
You might have mentioned you had that.
Strange... youd think hed have this place better guarded.
No record of him.
Whats this?
So the idea is if a guy punches me he really hurts his hand?
When we find him he is mine.
Artemus you ready for this?  His next target is Albuquerque.
I know  I know
Weve got to stop him right here now  With that armored steam engine of his itll be a slaughter.
It was in your book.
Are those just button buttons or...?
Artemus  Look at that.  Brand spanking new.  Shes a beauty huh?  Lets get rolling.
Time for you to get off Maam.
You know maam you remind me of a pearlhandled pistol I once owned. A beautiful thing to look at but too hot to handle.
Oh dont worry.  Ive already overlooked the fact your names not actually on our guest list.
Have you taken a wrong turn Mr. Tyler?
Youve... done... this... before.
You know I really hate being toyed with before someone shoots me.
Look Im Captain James West...
Why surely Mr. President there must be some mistake.  I mean...
Mr. President good to see you again sir.  Sorry about all that.
... well of course you can.  Mr. President what a surprise.  What brings you here?
Why dont we just cut this routine short?  Whatever you do to us were not going to talk.
... And do give me some room Voltaire.  Youre breathing on my head  I hate it when you breath on my head
These lands were taken by force from Mexico in the illegal War of American Aggression.
A Southern gentlemen.  I dont recall his name.  I suppose its unkind of me to say it but he had the most disconcerting glass eye.
This is something.
I beg your pardon?
Well?
Well come on thats half a dozen armed men...
Were going into battle little one.  Find a woman to take care of it.
You mean you know who this baby belongs to?

I cant.
I do what Im told.
Because its true.
Please?  Im dyin of thirst in here.
Thanks for your help Peck.

Whatcha thinkin about Willow?
You gotta promise to feed her.
And give her a bath everyday and dont let her get cold.  And keep her diaper changed.
You
Because shes sick.
Shes in love.
Watch it
I have an idea.  Back in my village we catch a lot of hedgehogs.

Dada whats a daikini?

Your will  Your will  What else could it be?
Get down  The ritual chant Quick  Protect yourself

Im getting her out of there
Hey careful there
Obviously.
Eat up Book. Whats the matter with your appetite?
Your hole is healed then?
Everything is all right John.
You ever handle a pistol like this Samuel?
Thats Luke. He doesnt like strangers.
Hey Sam...
Dont let them hurt you.
What have you got?
Thats the problem. We need results. The press is driving us crazy over this P2P thing. Calling us the speed capitol of the country. You know the sort of thing. Its getting political. The Commissioners getting very uneasy.
Whatshername moved to Buffalo.
Whats your first move?
Who else knows?
Youre going to have to do it right here Schaeffer.
You have no right to keep us here.
What was that?
Now whats the problem?
Oh? Anything else?
Who are they?
Listen thank you. Thanks for everything. But Ive got to go.
John Book I would appreciate it if during the time you are with us you would have as little to do with Samuel as possible.
Enjoying your reading?
What else can you do?
Sure.
Youre so sure of that?
There is always a way But you are such a... a Glotzkopp you cannot see Youd rather go back to that city To nothing No woman No children No land
I want you to take this... to remember by.
Anybody know about this?
Nothing. Im not going to be around for a while. Ill call you when I can.

You admit youre lying?
Either youre a member of the club or you arent Elton.  Tell me what you know...
Whats so funny?
Eh? Nothing? Rachel you bring this man to our house. With his gun of the hand. You bring fear to this house. Fear of English with guns coming after. You bring blood and whispers of more blood. Now English music... and you are dancing to English music And you call this nothing?

Frightened?  You are talking to a man who has laughed in the face of death  sneered at doom and chuckled at catastrophe.  I was petrified.  Then suddenly the wind changed and the balloon floated down into the heart of this noble city where I was instantly acclaimed Oz the First Wizard de Luxe
Now look heres something that really has a heart. This is the best invention I ever invented.
Who did it? Now wait a minute.
What are you going to do with my dog?  Give him back to me

I thought you said she was dead.
Pooh  what a smell of sulphur  Im afraid youve made rather a bad enemy of the Wicked Witch of the West.  The sooner you get out of Oz altogether the safer youll sleep my dear.
No  thats true. The only person who might know would be the great and wonderful Wizard of Oz himself
Oh now?
And think to yourself  Theres no place like home theres no place like home theres no place like home.
Oh

Dislocated collar bone.  If any more tendons snap...  It wont just be two weeks out of action.
He survived?
Now Robert is dead. He got his revenge.
Get out to the pipeline. Find the insider who switched the pin. If your instincts are right Renard will be back. He hasnt completed the job. The pipeline is still going forward and we have Elektra to thank for that.
Your last chance. Take the money.

Mother of God.
In the good old days the KGB had three or four spots where our submarines could surface without anyone knowing. But Yevgeny is supposed to be loading cargo.
Now you know how it feels.  To be locked away to wonder if theyre coming for you if anyone will ever come for you.
Everythings under control up here.  Are you ready?
Weve been pawns in someones game. They tricked us into bringing the money to King. Not just elaborate.  Cocksure.
Do we have the range of Renards plane?

Two things I hate.  Street mimes . . . users of recreational drugs.
