God youre just like him Just keep me locked away in the dark so I cant experience anything for myself
Its just you.
Youre not going unless your sister goes.  End of story.
Didnt have you pegged for a Gigglepuss fan.  Arent they a little too preteen bellybutton ring for you?
So they tell me...
Thirtytwo.
Yeah but these guys have never seen a horse.  They just jack off to Clint Eastwood.
Joey Dorsey?  Permashitgrin.  I wish I could say hes a moron but hes number twelve in the class.  And a model.  Mostly regional stuff but hes rumored to have a big tube sock ad coming out.
He seems like he thrives on danger
Like we had a choice?  Besides  when you let the enemy think hes orchestrating the battle youre in a position of power. We let him pretend hes calling the shots and while hes busy setting up the plan you have time to woo Bianca.
In that case well need to make it a schoolwide blow out.
Its her favorite band.
Best case scenario youre back on the payroll for awhile.
I don  t know.  I decided not to nail her when she was too drunk to remember it.
She just needs time to cool off Ill give it a day.

Are you lost?
Were not.
Patrick Verona   Random skid.
Does it matter?

Something like that
Its Scurvys.  His date got convicted. Whered you get the dress?
Oh huh
Because youre making decisions for me.
So what I want doesnt matter?
Whats the matter?  Upset that I rubbed off on her?
Expressing my opinion is not a terrorist action.

Yeah.  I guess.
No  Ive got a sweetpayin job that Im about to lose.
Touch of the flu.
Whats to discuss?
Well you know  theres the prestige of the job title... and the benefits package is pretty good...

Id love to argue with you sometimes.  But youre never here
I find that hard to believe.
They tried... but I didnt let them.
I am busy inside.
He asks when he can come to visit you.  He left his address.
Im not bargaining
... for a commoner?
Look out of that window.
What is it?  A tribe?  An island?
Tell the Chief we thank him.
He understands.
To open a new route to Asia.  At the moment there are only two ways of reaching it...
Ignorance  I believe the Indies are no more than 750 leagues west of the Canary Islands.
Ive been contradicted all my life... Eternity
Damn God
Father I have betrayed my family. I betrayed my men.  And I betrayed you.
If I tell them they wont follow me.  You know that I am right Father.  You trust me...
Give me absolution.
Oh?  So you are a new man?
No more than the woman who said she would take Granada from the Moors.
What did they say about Granada before today?
Surely you can do anything you want.
They come and go as naked as the day God created them...
My horse doesnt work.
Never Your Majesty.  Although...
Yes.  It would be a pity wouldnt it?  Call him back
Is this true Brother Buyl?
Where are we going?

Divorced.
So...the station is empty?
Yes I considered it.
Ill get my clothes.
...Do you really want me to forget about you?
Cmon start at the beginning.  You know these people?
Youre a cop  youll never believe me.
It was my decision not his.
Cause we got more important things to do like finding out who did it.
What was I supposed to do?  The guy tried to mug me.  I was gonna send a cop back  I just forgot.
But Chief?  Over this??
Vodka tonic.
Its okay.
Yeah.
Police.  Wed like to ask you a few questions.
He had a videocamera?  Where is she? Quickly
No we dont mind.  You mind Leon?
Nah why should you?
Pretty.
Maybe you dont care about that either.  Prettiest suspect Ive had in awhile.
Eastern Europe.  Like what?  Romania? Hungary?
Im on my way with Eddie.  Ludwigs. 63rd and Madison.  The suspects might be there already.
Of course.
Something back home?
Youre her Savior?  Is she the kid youre gonna save from the burning building?
Well you shoulda because nobodys gonna believe you didnt...including me.
What do you want?
Whats your accomplishment.
If you kill me and film it youre putting a noose around your neck.
I really cant give out any information right now at this point.
Yeah.  Nows not a good time.
Im not.
Youre ruthless.
See you later.  Good luck.
Dont be late.
Jesus Christ.
Im not moody.
Keep them out of my way.
No.  Are you proposing?
What?  It doesnt work that way.
Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.

Two weeks holiday.
Is there a problem?
Million?  The killer gets one million dollars for a television interview?
Okay.
Whatever we do  we fuck her right?
Cut
Did you hurt her?
Milos.  Get my money
You want the tape?  There it is
Of course hes moody.  He thinks hes in love.
Paulie youve got kids right?
This footage will work in your favor. When the jury sees this  no matter what Cutler tries theyll convict him.
Yes were in New York now.  But where are you planning to stay in New York?
Excuse me?
Look I dont have time for you get out of my way
A dog pissed on me  Im gonna sue you for this  You violated my civil rights
Hey by the way Im really sorry about your wife leavin you.
Capra?  Thats not Czech or Russian. Who said he sounded Russian?
Well how nice to see you again Elena. Youre looking wonderful.
Im sorry Dr. Smyslov but Im really not at liberty to discuss this.
Okay come on down.
I guess it isnt.
Yes I dont know what to make of it.
Well... Hals reported the AOunit about to fail again.
I understand Hal. Well take care of it. Please let me have the hard copy.
Yes I know that. But I can assure you that they were about to fail.
Yes it is Hal.
It doesnt have to be Hal. Its more dangerous to be out of touch with Earth. Let me have manual control please.
Hal switch to manual hibernation control.
I know that youve had that on your mind for some time now Dave but it would be a crying shame since I am so much more capable of carrying out this mission than you are and I have such enthusiasm and confi dence in the mission.
Yes I remember you mentioning it. I got mine about the same time.
Did they have any explanation for this?
In three days darling I hope.
Shes in the bathroom.
How many days until you come home?
Thank you Daddy.
I suppose it was bound to happen sooner or later.
Thank you. Its been a great pleasure to meet all of you... Dr. Smyslov.
Yes very pleasant.
I suppose you saw the work on our new section while you were docking.
Are you quite sure?
Are you by any chance going up to your base at Clavius?
You mean you havent been able to get anyone at the base for ten days?
Yes... Well I hope the crew got back safely.
Certainly.
Dr. Smyslov... Im not permitted to discuss this.
How can you tell it was deliberately buried?
I dont think it has but Id like to check that. Simpson whats the log on that?
Well... the crew is confined to the ship when we land at Clavius. We have to stay inside for the time it take to refit  about twentyfour hours. And then were going to back empty.
There is no other purpose for this mission than to carry out a continuation of the space program and to further our general knowledge of the planets. Is that true?
Hammond.
Great just great.
Try obeyin the law once in awhile and I wont have to hassle you...
Yeah dummy.  Money.
Just do what I say okay? Well pay for the girls and have a good time... Dont you trust me?
And I need one more for my pal. Yeah. Make her an Indian. No not a turban you know a squaw.
Excuse me baby but if i dont get some action tonight Im gonna bust.  You interested?
Here you go sweetheart throw it my way.
Heres hoping baby...
I just struck it rich... I think we can do a little business.  As a matter of fact I think we can have a party.
What are you talking about? We didnt kill her ...
Listen it may be a little out of date. You know I got a reputation for lookingreal sharp with the ladies...
You got a girl... shit... the generosityof women never ceases to amaze me.
You just dont get it do your Reggie?  There isnt any deal. I own your ass.
Then whatre you complainin about? At least nobodys calling you shithead....

Do you know how close I was to getting some trim.  And you fucked it up.
Its a long shot but...Billy used to tend bar here a few years back. I heard him talk about it.
I dont know what youre talking about. I just wanna see Ganz nailed.
Must be billys girl.
I wasnt sure the money was still there until we saw Luther. You almost got your ass shot off for nothing once not twice Jack.
Not really.  I figured Ganz was put down for a long time.  And I knew Luther would never job me on his own.  Hes too chickenshit.
Im not in this cause its fun. Im not into hitting guys cause it makes me feel good either... I do it cause it works...
Class isnt somethin you buy punk. Look at you five hundred dollar suit and youre still a lowlife.
Ill be there in a minute. You dont move your ass right?
What about Ganz?
You missed ... Luther took a taxi to the hotel across the street. Made a phone call.
You sure thats the reason?
I can just take her right across the street to Luthers hotel.  All I need is some money for the room.
I had it impounded.  Come on well use it for haulin you back to the slam.
Whatever play I maker just back me up.
Partnership?
Spare met Jack. Im into legit investments from here on in.
Anthing botherin you besides losin your gun?
Jack?

I didnt have the time.
Im taking my prisoner back to jail.
Are you gonna tell me about police procedure?  Do me a favor dont give me a bunch of crap.
Im heading out. How about you?
This is a .44 Magnum the most powerful handgun in the world. You gotta ask yourself just one question. Are you feelin lucky?
Youre hopeless.
I guess he got the message...
I think you forgot this. Hands him his wallet and badge...
I didnt get burned two cops did. Listen Ill tell you about personnel responsibility.  I like to get the job done right.  And if I dont get my job done right... Im for shit.

...Why on earth do the stones interest you?
Even it I did know where the stones were I would never tell somebody like you.
So you do know her.
Shes an exception..
I might call to check up on her you know... to see if shes better?
Is that the usual way priests go on vacation?

We do.
Well thats all I can do.  Sorry.
Eddie.
I know what you did.
I know what you did.
Nobody saw you bring her in?
Stop talking.
Show me where you buried her.
Dont think I wont.
I had three jerkoffs trying to return your tapes last month.  Do you know how bad a skin flick has to be for some jackass to come back into my place with a fucking receipt and try to fucking return it?
None of this would be happening if you would have left it alone.  If you werent digging up a girl who died six years ago.  A girl no one even remembers.
Shut your mouth and drive
Fuck you.
Go ahead shoot me.  Then try driving to Brooklyn with my brains all over the windshield.
Yeah... guess so.
Catchy title.  What are you really reading?  Hard to believe that books got any parts worth highlighting.
Might get drummed out of the pornographers union and then where would I be?
Three four years.
Max.
From Pennsylvania.  P.I. from PA. What are you doing out here?
Tomorrow night I get off at eight.
Wake up pops.  Your education begins tonight.

I see a ring on your finger.  You have any kids?
A weirdo making SM films?  Whod have thought it?
Where does he sell it?
Who is this in the mask?  Who is he?
Devil frightened me as much as it excited me but Id be hard pressed to choose a favorite.
Nope.
I try to be.
Ill do whatever I can to help.
Mostly.  Thats where he started his empire building.  He was a good man.  Notorious as an eccentric but that was something he cultivated.  He wanted to be legendary.
We were married fortyfive years. Hard even for me to imagine.  We had our troubles.  There were plenty of places for him to be other than here but he was always loyal to me and I to him.  I loved him deeply.
I know what Im asking.  Your compensation will be appropriate to the risk.  Youll need cash to buy information and Ill provide it.  I feel responsible Mr. Welles.  You saw what he did to her.
Youre joking.
Im here.
Yes but...
Neil... Neil Cole.
No.
They hired you.  Youre like a private detective?
We were divorced by then.  Things fell apart... he was living with a friend...
What?
Its been six years.
Mrs. Mathews?  Its Thomas.  Do you remember I was there a few weeks ago... asking about your daughter...
Im trying to find out.  She was a runaway.  Im looking into it for her parents.
Hes an imbecile.  I tried to warn my daughter but what can you do?
Excellent.  we accept MasterCard and American Express.
What?
Figure it out??  Ill be insane before I figure it out.  The only thing Im sure of is that I cant go to sleep.  Not while hes using me.
Maybe you shouldnt be working here so much.  You dont want to get stuck waiting tables for the rest of your life.
Who?
Hey youre not alone.  We have to stop him Im with you.
Give her time.  Beauty is skin deep.
It was Freddy.
She told us the story of Freddy.  Its a town legend.  He was a child killer who was freed on a technicality.
Well Mom Ill tell ya when two of your friends die the same day you let me know what it does to your appetite.
Oh God  He killed them

When Dan died you werent even asleep. You said so.  End of story.
Thats the only reason youre alive...
Yeah...So thats him.  And youre not crazy.
If they actually bothered to bury her.
So did Dan.
Well we gotta do something
It wasnt her mother.  The only reason were still here is that none of us has slept since the grad party.
Thats their problem.
Thats what the newspapers thought.  She spent the rest of her life in the asylum. After Kruegers trial she flipped out and hung herself so they thought.
Two hours a day six days a week.
Stick around please?
He invited me to his house last night.
It was supposed to be.  Dad had a heart attack two days ago.
Your father can be in Nome Alaska tomorrow.  We have two choices Ask them to send him out in a copter and take you off or the Shark can put back into Nome...

Let me by Elaine.
Not now Elaine

Kurtz youre drunk.  Whos in command of this ship?
We were in love but Im not sure I know what love is anymore.
Well to tell the truth they really didnt fill me in on many of the details. Just told me to pick up Captain Kramer.

I cant tell.
Im not sure. I havent seen anything like this since the Lina Wertmuller Film Festival.
Yes. Yes of course.
I have been patient and Ive tried to help but you wouldnt even let me do that.
But if youll just give me...
Sluggish. Like a wet sponge.
Yes Captain?
Runway niner. Its the longest and directly into the wind.
Watch your altitude Striker. Its too erratic. You cant come straight in. Youve got enough fuel left for two hours flying. Youve got to stay up there til we get a break in the weather.
I thought maybe youd like to hear a song.
Oh yes I saw. Poor child.
Thank you.
No. No thank you.
The cockpit? What is it?
Would you go up please?

The girl out front mentioned Straders assistant somebody named Watson.  Maybe he knows.
Your voice is saying no but your body is saying yes.
Jesus Sykes  its been less than ten hours.  Me and Alterez are on it okay?
No Sergeant  not history...  Eternity...
This is becoming a serious breach of security.
The murder at the minimart is not our case.  The Captain said
So the Slag theyre cutting into upstairs worked at a refinery just like Hubley worked at a refinery.  Id say that possible connection between the two cases just got a hell of a lot more possible.  Okay next step  I gotta go talk to the wife of the Slag store owner blown away last night.
Todd Watson.  The assistant manager.
Ta sstrakyona...
Yeah go home.  Get some sleep.  You do sleep dont you?
George shes not gonna divorce you. You mate for life remember?
To the... to the beach?
Like your cocaine I suppose.  The high lasts several hours.  We would receive small amounts of it... as a reward for our labor.
Your people dont know about this part of out past.  And they cant know  It would threaten our entire existence here.
You understand that.  But how many others will?
You look very good.
The human?
Yeah Ill bet.
You mean the Blob?  Theyre finishing up now.
Hey look  weve known Kristin since... since she was conceived in that cabin up in Big Bear. Remember?  You and Edie banged the wall so hard me and Carol were picking plaster out of our hair for a week...
Whatever gave you that idea?
Awright  I want a nice clean dispersal this time.
Vasquez take point.  Lets move.
Lets go.  Pull em out.
Hard to say.  It may have been blind instinct...attraction to the heat of whatever...but she did choose to incubate her eggs in the one spot where we couldnt destroy her without destroying ourselves.  Thats if she exists of course.
How long until it blows?
What?
Cancer.  Hmmmm.  They still havent licked that one.  Cremated.  Interred Parkside Repository Little Chute Wisconsin.  No children.
Look I believe you but there are going to be some heavyweights in there.  You got Feds you got interstellar commerce commission you got colonial administration insurance company guys...

Well it didnt occur to me.  Its been policy for years to have a synthetic on board.
Uhhunh.  One of thirty or so all over the planet.  Theyre completely automated.  We manufacture them by the way.
Dont make me pull rank Ripley.
But they will know about it Burke. From me.  Just like theyll know how you were responsible for the deaths of one hundred and fiftyseven colonists here 
Were trained to deal with these kinds of situations.

PDTS.  PersonalData Transmitters. Every adult colonist had one surgically implanted.
Gorman  Give it a rest would you.

Why do I have to be humiliated in front of my guests by one of my own servants?

Hey
Ahha
Well there it is. Now to business. Young man we are going to commission an opera from you. What do you say?
And the result satisfies.
Of course not.
It is not a question of liking Your Majesty. Your own law decrees it Im afraid.
Really? Oh grazie Signore Sono commosso E un onore per mo eccezionale. Compositore brilliante e famossissimo
Of course I do. Its very good. Of course now and then  just now and then  it gets a touch elaborate.

Composition doesnt pay. You know that.
I want you to come back with me to Salzburg my son.
No one calls you that.
Good morning sir.
Yes thank you sir.
Bene.
My name is Lorl sir. Im a maidservant. I was asked to come here and offer my services to you.

Do you mean that?
Im too young to be so sick.
Yes.
I think so.
Im not leaving you.

In the sight of God that is a sin.

Im surprised you dont know. It was a very popular tune in its day. I wrote it. How about this?
Ah  youve heard that?
I poisoned his life.
Yes?
Italian?
Yes.
Incredible.
Yes in the third act.
Show her in. Then go to bed.
Well hes sleeping now. Better not.
Oh yes. Hes just exhausted. He became dizzy thats all. We should let him rest.
Has his friend appeared to him again?
David has suffered a severe trauma. I myself witnessed some form of mass neurosis in East Proctor. If all the villagers believe that Jack Goodman was killed by a werewolf why shouldnt David? And then it follows that if he survived an attack by a werewolf wouldnt he himself become a werewolf the next full moon?
Have you read the papers today? Have you listened to the radio or television?
No a cab will be faster.
I dream of death mostly.
Will you come with me?
There is only one bed.
Of course.
I was awake and he was in my room.
I wasnt hallucinating.
A doper werewolf.
See you later.
I dont know why I feel so good. I havent felt this good in a long time.
No.
No.
Yes I should think. He called out just now.
Hey you asshole I want you to arrest me
Queen Elizabeth is a man Prince Charles is a faggot Winston Churchill was full of shit
Youre going to have to stop this disturbance or I shall arrest you.
This isnt Mr. Goodmans idea. He is your good friend whereas I am a victim of your carnivorous lunar activities.
Oh come on tell us.
Alex?
Do you have bad dreams too?
London? Wheres Jack? I had a strange dream.
The guy I was with. Is he all right? How did I get to London?
So they said.
Did you see Jack?
Oh I dont know. I mean look around. Isnt this a fun place?
I think Debbie Klein is a mediocre person with a good body.
Weve known Debbie what since the eighth grade? How many years of foreplay is that?
Its a fivepointed star.
I dont know. Lets see if theres an inn or something up the road.
I see and they were too embarrassed to talk about it because they felt so silly.
Are you going to help me up?
Im a grisly sight its true but I love you and thats why Im here. Youve got to know.
The wolfs bloodline must be severed. The last remaining werewolf must be destroyed.
What?
Nurse
Nurse Oh God Alex
Dont be an asshole David. Come here.
Yes.
How shall I do it?
Oh thats been there for two hundred years. We were going to paint it out but its traditional so we left it.
But I can heat some up for you if youd like.
That is precisely my point. David as far as we are concerned the matter is closed. We wont trouble you any further. Good day.
No kidding. When I saw it you coulda knocked me over with a pin.
Matt?
The detectives got Matt up there in Sampsons office.
It was more than that last week.
Heres twentyfive thousand.
Ten bucks? Say if I had ten bucks Id quit.
Where do you think Ive been?  I took the baby for a stroll in the park.
Say dont annoy me. I got troubles of my own.
Yes sir.
What good will that do?  Why it will take control away from him. Well put somebody else in charge call in all doubtful loans and be on safe ground again. Thats what good it will do
Of course yes. Just what would you like to know Inspector?
Oh yes of course. There was someone with me. A lady.
Somebody must be in good humor. He was humming Mother Machree.
Dont forget theres a dead watchman downstairs.
I know I know Dude. Oh I must have been crazy I lost my head completely
I havent got it.
All you gotta do is fix a few things for us  and well do the rest see?
You? No youll be all right so long as you establish an alibi for tonight.
Well you can. You always could.
Dont you know?
Im not afraid of you. You havent got a moustache
Im listening.
Yes.
You can take some of the girls. You can take Mildred  or Gwynn
In Cluetts apartment? Well dear you see I . . . I . . .
I havent got any new stories for them this morning either.
Where is he now?
Yes sir.
No sir.
Why wouldnt you tell me where you were last night?
Good.  Youve got nothing to worry about. Soon as the report comes in youll be released.  And listen dont talk so loud. Take it easy. Coast a little.
Im afraid hes been stalling.
Mine too?
Whatll we do?
I hate to do this but Ive got to have time to dig up some help. I think I know where I can get some real cash. Snap into it Sampson. We will lick this thing yet.
Is that busy husband of mine busy?
With what?
Oh you think Im lying?
Come here.  You know a few minutes ago I was in Cluetts office and Mrs. Dickson was there.
I tell you I saw them
Yes right in his office the rat. Id like to take a crack at that guy.
Who? Cluett? No not yet. But Id like to take a crack at that stiff necked horse dollar.6
Ive been trailing the cashier like you told me. Youre right about that guy chief. Theres something screwy somewhere.
Yes sir.
It couldnt have been earlier?
Then where were you?
Dammit this stopped being fun about two years ago
Anywhere nobodys shooting at me is pretty.
What?
WHAT HAVE YOU DONE?
Hey
Yes. I am obviously not standing out in peoples minds at the robberies.
Youre not scared are you?
After all you did on our farm?  You miss it dont you Jesse?
So what do we do General Lee?
Sorry.
Just because he reads all those books and knows all those big words doesnt make him smart.
If youd read about it first youd have no problems.
I got us through the War all right.
Pass me some whisky.
Whos next? You? Me? Bob?
Pff. All we been through the thought never crossed my mind.
You pay me to find you Bluecoats. There they are.
Must be a garrison in town. Were in occupied territory boys.
Which one right or left?
Sadie was not a man
Strategically.
They gonna rush us?
Where is Jesse James?
The District Marshall
Youre right sir.
Id appreciate that.
I think hes already feeling better.
No Jesse your problem is youre always doing stuff before Im finished figuring it out.
We better go to Docs see whats going on here.
You can shut up now.
Make a thousand of em. Still wont be enough by the time Im through.
Fine. Howd it go out here?
Bobs upset.
I know. But thats how it should have ended. Your Dad and Mom riding off into a new life growing old together happy.
Sounds like he was a hell of a man.
Theyre making him a hero now.
Boys?
What you do to me is unfair. The teasing I mean.
Unfair. You are completely unfair.
Is this one of Franks Shakespeare poems youre trying to quote?

Thanks.
I hope Im not being too forward.
Lyla Devereux.
They had to be dealt with
NO It is NOT my pleasure to have to leave my board room to come to this godforsaken piece of dirt to discover why in the name of all that is holy you cannot seem to evict a few simple farmers from their PATHETIC LITTLE MUDHOLES so that I may build the GREATEST railroad that this country has ever seen
Yes sir.
A further impediment is that the Army garrison has been ordered to move on from Liberty. We will no longer have that particular stick with which to threaten the farmers.
Sir?
What sir?
Oh that. Ill let Jenkins explain.
Im losing millions of dollars and months of time while you play chess with these farmers
I cant believe this.
Pumpkin?

If hes really a bully he wont cop to it anyway.
But hes not quite the same guy anymore. Dont get your hopes too high?
I think thats great Milo. I do.
Dont bring that up. Like a different girlfriend woulddve let you die?
Teddy was killed last night.
I dont know I just know it was Teddys code. All these ideas flying in from everywhere. You know how he says Any kid working in his garage can put us out of business? Its like they know what every kids doing.
Like this? Its Gary youre talking about.
Milo you told me those DOJ Agents are all over the place. How could they hope to hide a surveillance post?  And how can you get in there anyway? With the cameras and the swipe cards 
...Whaddo I do?
...Different?
Yeah. Hi. Thank you for seeing me.
You cant preempt Yoga thats our biggest show.
Whatd they ever do for you?
Wanna be a part of history?
Is it your dish?
Outpost was his baby sure. On the other hand we just learned Gary Boyd owns the Skywire satellites. Personally.
We tried
He just likes to write code. Hes bummed theres so much secrecy and competition everybody trying to own everything.
It needs a more objectoriented language. This doesnt scale does it?
Whatre you implying.
Im sure.
It helps. Alice said it would help. To focus on something.  Dont know what Id do without her.
Im not much good at handwriting. Or parties.
You see whats hanging on the wall?
Startup not 50 miles from here. Kids on Prozac.
Nothing does. Still. I want him to like me.
Gary dont worry we 
Lets go.
You are naive. Look at your employment contract you cant work anywhere else in this field for at least few years.  Not that I dont miss you.
Got out of my other commitment.
Unlikely. All 14 cameras are frozen. Do we call Randy and Phil? Tell em there may have been a breakin?
Keep looking.
Lets get him in here.
They know. Just they dont trust me with it. So well get the evidence first ask questions later.
Where we going?
I launched Skywire. Just pray the last set of coordinates Milo sent me connected us to Garys satellite.
I wouldnt worry about it. Youve gotta figure most people around here were their teachers pets.
...Something like that. Yeah.
Graphical interfaces. For Skywire? Im sposed to coordinate with you.
Then and now.  But not right now.
She saved my life.
Hmm?
But still you cant say CBS wouldnt love to break something like 
But theyd still get the idea right?
Before they kill somebody else too.
You mean  break in?
And what if the broadcast dishes on top of 21 arent hot yet? You said the place isnt finished.
Yeah thats old in a tree.
Milo? What if Shrot notices somebody entered the Day Care at four A.M.? And tells them about it?
Perfect.  How am I gonna get away from the party long enough to 
At this point the worst thing I could do is anything out of the ordinary.
Lets try 2.
And your phone messages. You wanna do what you do its not a crime.
Uh. Not exactly.
What?
What dyou mean?
I could get it out of him.
Mmmm... I feel extreme relaxation.
Thats very clever. Do you know any other poems?
Thank you thats beautiful. To your health.
If you can become famous everyone will have their fifteen minutes of fame man.

Yes Basil?
Hey Mick
Well you cant always get what you want.

Well as long as people are still having promiscuous sex with many anonymous partners without protection while at the same time experimenting with mindexpanding drugs in a consequencefree environment Ill be sound as a pound.
If its a lie goddamn her. It its the truth goddamn me.  God I hope thats witty. Hows your mum?
I went to Oxford and excelled in several subjects but I ended up specializing in foreign languages. I wanted to travel  see the world. In my last year I was accepted into the M.O.D. in the Cultural Studies sector. I thought I was off on an exciting career but my job was to read everything printed in every country. Its very boring. My whole day is spent reading wedding announcements in Farsi. If I do well with this case I finally get promoted to field operative...
We dont use the term Negro anymore. Its considered offensive.
Sure.
Im sure.
Do you want to talk to him?
Why?
Indeed.
Shut up.
Likewise.
Thats not mine.
I dont even know what this is. This sort of thing aint my bag baby.
Hey wait a minute
In many ways Bobs Big Boy never left sir. Hes always offered the same high quality meals at competitive prices.
Should we scramble TacHQ for an intercept?
Yes.
These are the latest word in android replicant technology.  Lethal efficient brutal. And no man can resist their charms. Send in the soldiers
Dr. Evil?
Theyre mutated sea bass.
Arent you going to watch them? Theyll get away
I have a gun in my room. Give me five seconds Ill come back and blow their brains out.
I dont want to.
Gentlemen I have a plan. Its called blackmail. The Royal Family of Britain are the wealthiest landowners in the world. Either the Royal Family pays us an exorbitant amount of money or we make it look like Prince Charles the heir to the throne has had an affair outside of marriage and therefore they would have to divorce.
Oh God no I made him sleep on the couch.

Too many cooks 
And you must be Steed. Please dont get up.
So what was all this  some sort of test?
And now that weve settled the matter of honorifics will you kindly explain why you wished me to meet you?
Were not here to talk about the weather surely.
Do you really think so?
An eccentric recluse?
June July ... August?
Small talk.  Try the weather.
Did he say who?
Very good Steed ...
Is there anything that isnt?
Filling in mother natures blind spots ... ?
But if someone miniaturized the process...
Sounds as if someones hijacked your research.
... And by you Mrs. Peel ...
Mrs. Peel ... ?
I expect thats for you to know and me to find out ...
I could be convinced if ... I knew who poisoned me in the maze. That kiss ...
Arent we all Mrs. Peel?
Winning isnt everything.
After you  Mrs. Peel ...
... Or grownups who still like to be children.
... in a beautiful pea green boat...
Im no spy  where do I fit in?
Mobile HQ. In a blue funk.  Cant take chances. Im looking after things while hes hiding out ...
Decontamination  ?

Peters brother?  But 
Let me guess  Wonderland Weather.

Anyone particular in mind?

Nuthin I cant handle.

I cant lie to him.  If he asks me something I tell him what I think.
Light?
The first and only time.  A big mistake.  Im gonna have to ask you not to see Mantan anymore.
I perfectly understand where youre coming from.  As a minority I can relate to your struggle also.  But I think you should give us all a chance.  We want this pilot to be successful just as much as you. Please dont be so quick to judge us based only on our whiteness.
Pressure?  DeLa you dont know what the hell real pressure is. SHEEETT  This is lightstuff. Now when you scramblin out on the street in da January winter and the hawk is talkin to you with NO money and NO prospects of money anytime soon now that there is some pressure.
Now Im privileged?  Why?  Because I didnt grow up on food stamps and welfare?  Because I didnt call home a cardboard box?  No I never ever went to bed hungry and Im proud of it too.  Whoever told you that living in poverty earns you somekind of badge of honor flat out lied to you.
I feel fine.
It looks delicious.
Cmon Mommy dont start with that Im an ungrateful son stuff.
Cant beat it with a hammer.  Well since you asked it looks like I may have a new show a pilot being shot.
If at first its not what you want just work that much harder Peerless.
Its gonna be hard for me to get away with the show taking off.
Whats a Negro.
Did you just ask me whats a Negro? IM A NEGRO
The best defense is offense.
This show was created conceived by you a nonthreatening African American male.  Voila.  End of argument.  It cant be racist because youre black.
A little.  I just graduated from NYU film school.  Cinema studies.
I think that would probably make you the happiest.  When Im hoofing I mean really doing my thing hitting it nothing compares to that feeling in the world.
Im more comfortable around my people.
Money makes the world go round.  It aint no joke being poor.  I know whatImtalkinbout. YknowwhatImsayin?  Ive lived on the street.  Ive been homeless. Ive learned how to play the game work the game be in the game.
I dont know what a retort is but its simple.  Mantan  The New Millennium Minstrel Show is UNIVERSAL.  Its not just for Negroes in Compton or 125th in Harlem.  This is America.  Our ancestors helped build this country we got a right just like everybody else.  Im not gonna box myself in. This show makes people think and theyre laughing at the same time.
Tell em what you mean Mistuh Mantan.
You tellin the truth.
The one with da big...
Sleep N Eat one of dem slinky sexy little foxy...
...to big.  The inbetween one not too tight not too lose.
...dats too much money.  I cant ford it.  I needs me a dress that cost no mo than...
No.  Thats her second cousin. Whos married to Lil Bit.
...too early...
...too late maybe around...
...like grits and butter...
You expect the unexpected in circumstances of that peculiarity.
How be dat?
Mantan dat sho is a whopper.
A song a comin I feel.
Are you trying to rap to me?
Just a little something somethin.
No before my time.
I just dont want you and Cheeba to get hurt.
Yknow what?
You look beautiful like that.
And what?
Why dont you answer?
Not at all sir.  I have a pair of good pistols that have already done execution and are ready to do it again.
I never was more in earnest.
It was my joke.  I was tired and did not care to go farther.  Theres not prettier woman here than that. If she wont suit your fancy my friend then you must wait awhile.
How do you do sir?
Your loyalty to me and your service to the regiment has pleased me very well  and now there is another occasion on which you may make yourself useful to us if you succeed depend on it your reward will be your discharge from the army and a bounty of 100 guineas.
Only a very little as soldiers do.
The man that marries Dorothy Dugan must first kill me  do you mind that?
I am Harry James son and will act as becomes my name and quality.
I had news of you in Dublin.  Faith youve begun early like your fathers son but I think you could not do better than as you have done. But why did you not write home to your poor mother?  She has sent halfadozen letters to you in Dublin.
I am only sorry that I was unable to prevent the villain from carrying off all her ladyships money and pearls.
Sirrah  Sirrah I am as good a gentleman as any in Ireland
I deny your Graces accusations and beg you to say how you have been cheated?
I will let down the steps for your honor.
You are going to drive to the frontier.
I have orders to gag your honor if you cry out and to give you this purse containing ten thousand frederics if you do not.
Your honor must lower his voice.
The gentleman has nothing contraband.
Yes sir.  Here is my letter.
No one sir.  Before that I served in the army but had to leave due to weakness of the loins.
Id give five years of my life to see the old country again the greenfields and the river and the old round tower and the burying place.
Make your mind easy you shall not be left behind I warrant you.  Do take a last look at your barracks make your mind easy say a farewell to your friends in Berlin.  The dear souls how they will weep when they hear you are out of the country and out of it you shall go.
Then ordering fresh horses the Chevalier set off on his journey for that capital.  I need not tell you that I was the Chevalier.
Certain?
But for a time... a passing fancy?
To love you until death.  To subscribe to all your commands.
Then you must get it.
I had not been in the room five minutes before I was engaged for every single set.
Well then Ill tell you what Id do.  Id jump Daisy into the river and swim you both across where no enemy could follow us.
Indeed Miss Dorothy I intend to have his blood as sure as my names Roderick.
Do you happen to know Gustavus Adolphus the thirteenth Earl of Crabs?
Yes
What is to be done?
You must be very cautious with regard to the company you should meet in Dublin where rogues and adventurers of all countries abound. I hope you will do me the honor of accepting lodgings in my own house where Captain OReilly will welcome with delight my gallant young preserver.
Yes of course.
I see.
Well well just have to wait and see wont we?
What the devil?  What kind of fools do we have here?  Pottle who told the lad this story?
Brooksy was better than you papa he used not to swear so and he taught me many good things while you were away.
The milkmaids daughter?
Is it not a pleasure gentlemen for me as I am drawing near the goal to find my home such a happy one my wife so fond of me that she is even now thinking of appointing a successor?  Isnt it a comfort to see her like a prudent housewife getting everything ready for her husbands departure?
And he doesnt care about me?
Tender Hegenheim.
Its ten thirty in the morning.
Yeah and I couldve used the sleep. Im supposed to meet people here tonight try and get some work going.
What do we do?
We found him like this...
Tell me about them.
Im serious 
They would have killed us both. You want me to write a confession Ill write a confession.
And the bodies?
Washout rejects guys he said were dumbfucks too stupid to know they dead...
Mueller was alone in the cabin?
Dont know on a map. West told us it was there we just found it. Maybe the hurricane took it away.
Sir Dunbar sir
Oh bullshit hes a fucking convict. You know how much he hated West 
Why?
We just want to check your pack 
Yeah...
Oh come on 
Enough to go to prison? Childs PX scam Mueller was in on it 
You saw West right? How was he killed?
From up close or far away?
What dont you know?
Senator Daddy must be thrilled.
You said you wanted to know what happened  Im telling you the truth.
Right in front of us. Mueller went after him but we held him back.
I honestly dont know. Maybe to have someone to cover for him. And I wish I could but theres no doubt in my mind he killed those men.
My heart weeps.
No. I said Dunbar.
Then well leave it up to the courts  His word against mine. What does his father do again? Steelworker?  Doesnt matter Im sure justice will be served. In any case my father will definitely want to talk to you about all these questions these accusations on his son. Hes quite protective.
Im assuming thats what made him the dead one?
He can wait. Kendalls out of surgery.
There was a hurricane Bill the wind probably moved it.
From Dunbar? I hate to break this to you but I dont think hes gonna be all that psyched to put himself in for the death penalty.
The Senator...
I thought you said that wasnt a compliment.
Thats preposterous 
You want to get into a finger pointing contest about character? The army kicked you out for drugs the cops fired you for taking bribes from a mobster and you think you can stand there and lecture me on codes of conduct? Theres only one criminal standing in this room and its you.
You knew Sergeant West?
That is the most unprofessional 
Imagine what it must have been like for them out there. What do you think of Dunbar?
Got it.
I dont think that has anything to do with 
You knew what he was capable of and you just stood by. It was just a matter of time till somebody fragged his ass and you know what? He deserved it. Theres your confession.
Watch me.
You did more than try. You cracked Dunbar in less than three minutes as an investigator youre phenomenal 
Oh spare me the reverse psychology bullshit This isnt my great second chance Osborne. Everyone thinks Im a piece of shit cop who took money and nothing is going to change that. Nobody will ever know what happens here 
Because its my job. Because people are dead. Because of the whole honor and duty thing make a difference in the world crap like that.  We can do this Hardy.
What?
What Kendall said  the type of guys you dont feel comfortable going to sleep around. Thats what Dunbar said about Childs to the letter.
See I just take your gun to the morgue and fire it into one of their skulls then I call every newspaper in the country with the story about how Senator Kendalls gay son went nuts on a training mission 
You couldnt have known 
Thats gonna stay my secret.
Maybe... Maybe we were nowhere near. Sometimes mysteries stay mysteries.  I havent by any chance grown on you have I?
Isnt this how your story goes?
Seven.
This is the perfect time. You know what makes a good detective? The number of confessions they get. Youre a good detective Osborne. So now you get mine.
Yeah. I can wait till youre off the base and do it myself.
Leaving without saying goodbye. What are you gonna do?
In case you need me to testify about the shooting. Theyll clear you.
Poor fucker my ass...
What The Truth? Please. There are degrees of truth officer always degrees. Things are not what they seem.
Youre gonna die tonight faggot. Clear as day.
Because hed shot Mueller.
You cant threaten me 
I scared Dunbar into silence. Hes been trying to cover for me the whole time. We got here you came to see me... I didnt know if I could trust him with that kind of secret 
 failure to comply with this arrest is a court martialable offense in and of itself 
Yeah.
Maam Ray Dunbars black.
Hes former Army and the best Ive ever seen in a room. Besides he knows the territory we did Basic together here.  Youve had three hours with Dunbar and havent gotten a peep we need to take a different tack.
He tried to burn Dunbar to us. You dont do that if youre not involved.
It was on that night Karl met his destiny. And I met mine. Almost.
I just saw the woman Im going to marry I know it. But then I lost her.
Yes
I dont expect to.
Was she nekkid?
I suspect it will hurt a lot.
Apparently Ive overlooked this one piece of it and Id like to remedy that. You see in order for the town to be preserved the trust must own it in its entirety.
Please. Go. Just go.
Go.
Stop.
Well we were all set to but there was a complication.
Whats your name Giant?
I love every square inch of it. But I can feel the edges closing in on me. A mans life can only grow to a certain size in a place like this.  So what do you say? Join me?
Okay.
Beats me.
Did you do any of that?
You think Im up for it?
Really.
What did he say?
I will.
Its rude to talk about religion. You never know who youre going to offend.
Oh so you know.
What?
What youre seeing down to my nose? My chin?
It would kill you huh?
The river?
How what happens?
Somehow youre better. Different. Youre getting ready to go. And I say...

Youre asking for my documents?

Somebody must be suffering somewhere youre being so nice.

If anything happens to her while Im here 
I dont think there is another human being in this whole world who would have helped us.
Oh?
Can the maker repair what he makes?
What about E.M.S. recombination?
Put it this way.  Rolls Royces are made to last  as least they were. But Im afraid youre a Ferrari. A high strung racing car  built to win not to last.
Of course not.
I dont know much about biomechanics Roy.  I wish I did but youre out of my league.
His company made us.
Be better if I could talk to him in person.  But hes not an easy man to get to.
Not if everybody is doing their job here at home.  How are things at home?
Five.  Three nights ago one of them managed to break into the Tyrell Corporation.  Killed two guards and got as far as the Genetic Sector before he got fried going through an electro field.
Were using Esper  a 231  that picked up Holdens alarm.  Its guess is that all five are in the city.
Yeah.
Your customer eh?
Soon as I finish the job.
This is Esper and Im ready.  Go ahead please.
The five in question are third generation Nexus Sixes constructed of skinflesh culture selected enogenic transfer conversion capable of selfperpetuating thought paraphysical abilities and developed for emigration program.  Are you with me?
Unlike a five they can sustain massive traumas to several parts of the body without debilitating another.  Sever a leg and it will perform quicker on the remaining leg than the fastest man can run
And what in your estimation works?
Nexus designated Pris  incept data December 13 2017 competitive programmed to provide pleasure for long term spacers.
Ill but you one.  Whatll you have?

You have a little boy.  He shows you his butterfly collection plus the killing jar.
Is this testing whether Im an android or a lesbian?
Me and my dad.

Andies only simulate suffering  if theyre programmed for it.

Whats that supposed to mean?
Well thats blunt
No.
Hes from Alaska.
Eve?
Right here?  Well youre being so bossy I wasnt sure
Yes you do
You know I asked him about that. And he said that good manners are a way we have of showing other people that we respect them. See youd eat like a slob if you were alone but since another human being is present you show that person respect by going to the trouble of having proper manners. I didnt know that. I thought it was a way of appearing superior.  Know what else he told me?
Well find him.
I dont know.  Everythings so neat. Its all just so...goddamn dear.  Damn
Have him committed.
You bet Mom Coming up
Sometimes it helps to talk things over. For instance many marriages are saved by.
Fine Frank. Fine. How are you?

EXCUSE US por favor Hey. Let Tits see her kid.
I understand. Im just real curious like you said.
Yes?
I wont let the bastards get me up against the wall. Its an act of defiance.
Its blue. Blue velvet.
I have no hard proof of any of this. Her address is also on the photos. I think these people are involved with drugs and murder. I think Frank is killing drug dealers and...  ...and somehow Frank is getting all their drugs. I had to tell you I got slightly more involved in this than you wanted me to but its over now for sure. I had to tell you about these things in case it could help.
I cant tell you the whole story. I. I took it upon myself. I cant say more.

Does Dorothy know her husband is dead?
Nope its new stuff. No smell.

Oh he forced you huh?
He became obsessed with her. She hated him. He had to have her. He kidnapped them to control her. To make her do things. Then she wanted to commit suicide so he started cutting off ears as a warning to her to stay alive. Im not kidding. Frank loved blue blue velvet. He had to have Dorothy cause her whole life was blue.
What?
Be right down.

Alright.
Yeah lets get outta here. What happened?
Well its Friday night and youre a beautiful girl. I guess you would have a date that does that.
No way. Im about to blow up.
I dont see how I can and I cant prove any of this. I got all this information illegally. Also it could get you in trouble.
Actually. Ive been in twice.
I will. Ill pick you up on the same corner at three thirtyfive okay?
Okay Sandy.
Number two. I saw the Yellow Man come out. This time with a well dressed man with an alligator briefcase. They drove down this factory building and stood on a staircase looking at something in the distance. Number three. Now get this. In the distance was a murder. A drug dealer shot to death and a woman with her legs broken.
Yeah.
Yes. Is that so surprising? Yeah I worry a lot. I got you into this.
Yeah. I think so. I just had to tell him some of what I knew. Is Friday still on?

Yeah. I was only twelve or thirteen when you guys used to talk about him like he was a ghost or something.
What?
Wheres your gun?
Lets do him right here.
Fuck it Im doing it. I deserve it. Ive been working for those fat bastards since I was in high school and look at this place.
He probably knew youd end up nailing the fat guy maybe one or two more but he had to know you werent walking out of there. Figure it out. Shooters dead on the scene. No indepth investigation. Itd slide right off his back. Cause as much as I love ya youre not exactly Don Corleone. What would he be losing? A thirty five year old delivery boy?
Fuck man I may as well have posted flyers. Right out in public man.
This guy is very sharp. If he hasnt figured us out yet he will.
You wont do it Connor you wont. You love me man.
Connor is that you?
Is that worthless brother of your there? I want you both ta hear this.
Well you know how it is with him. Always complainin hes never turnin a profit on St. Pattys. Whole damn family goes down there with no money cause we know he cant bear ta charge us.
Come on ma. Out with it. Who came out first?

Yes we are.
Yes.
Holy shit. Who? How many?
Im strangely comfortable with it.
Afuckinmen
We do not ask for your poor or your hungry.
With every breath we shall hunt them down.
Oh come on now Rozengurtle. I was just tryin ta get a rise outta ya.
Thats just fucking weird. I have no idea.
These guys were pros. I think they were coming for one target the fag man he was the...
What?
Crime of passion. He just went nuts. He would have shot everyone in here. He just ran out of bullets.
Twist of lemon
Shit Shit
Yeah fuck it. If you think about it its all you can do really. You cant tell him it was us. Go in braggin and shit.
Hey Murph.
So?
Well Id say that makes him a lia fuckinbility.
We have to go now.  Were on the lamb.
Youll make it outta here. You cant ever stop not ever.
You have entered the house of the Lord of your own free will speaking of beliefs and feelings. Is it so much to believe that God has brought you here?
Yes.
Open it
Fuck you Vincenzo.
I caught your show down at the velvet room at the Holiday Inn loved it when you busted into Viva Las Vegas.
Black hair. Paul Michael Glaser.
Right. The blond guy.
He says. This is he.
Kind of. Except weve already got the keys.
Nothing. Go ahead.
Youre out Im not working with either one of you
Unlock that door.  Check the aisles.
Oh shit. That was scary. In the middle of the robbery. The manager looks at me. Right in the eye. And goes Im going to remember you.
Bob?
Then youre going to have to dye it Anthony. Weve got to hide our identities. Especially after Bob crashed the car.
Hi.
What. Whats the matter?
No kidding.
No no. Look. OK. Lets stay here until we find out whats going on.
Dont worry about it Bob.
This was in fourth grade.
After that my parents never let me go to Dignans again.
Where was it parked?
Maybe he just went to the store.
We said 48 hours.
Bob went to help his brother. I understand that and I cant help it if you dont.
I dont really feel like talking about it. The only thing I feel like is getting the fuck out of this place.
What?
I dont think we can do that.
I dont know Dignan. I just 
Youre so spoiled. What is not good to you? Only a few hundred 
I know.
Get out of the way.
Easy Dignan. Its OK.
Look youre going to do fine. Its OK to be scared.
He was all right.
Stand by Bird Dog.
It was Bob. His walkie talkies busted.
I dont know.
Ill see you there.
I dont think so.
Oh Id say about 
Behind Bobs house.
What can I say? Its jail. You dont sleep when you want to. You dont eat when you want to.
Nice to meet you.
Thanks.
So do I.
Me?
Yeah.
See you Bob.
He looked too shakenup.
And if Future Man doesnt get let out of jail in 48 hours then we go back. All right?
No I dont mind.
Sixty days?
Why were you drawing the Holy Mary?
Jesus Christ No.
Sure.
No.
Whos got the car keys?
Temporarily.
Is that Buckethead?
True.
I dont know about that.
Not even for emergencies?
As much as I want. When these plants bud Ill probably have about six thousand dollars worth of weed.
Good question.
Youre paranoid Bob.
I warned you Dignan.
Well dont blame me. I told you.
God DAMMIT.
Dont count it.
No. All hell remember is a guy with a piece of tape on his nose.
Thats true. That would give me nightmares.
I told you they were there.
Its registered in my mothers name.
See you in a little while.
Well the marijuana crop is a good start.
They also found my two beam scale in the garage.
I was just going to use it to see how much I had.
Well obviously we got to go back.
Dont threaten me Bob.
Lets go.
I didnt have any choice.
I know it man. Hang on.
Id appreciate it if you didnt go around telling people lies about me.
This is Anthony Adams Mr. Henry.
Cant get it. It wont... 
Will it track back to us?
And the Landy woman?
Never heard of it.
What are you after Pam? You want to fry me? You want my desk? Is that it?
...this is Conklins computer.
I wasnt sleeping.  You OK?
Thanks.
What?
Then what?
Youre a liar.
YOURE A LIAR
Sorry. Old habits.
I like it here.  Last time I saw you was Greece. You had a good spot.
Shot dead in Paris. Dead the night you walked out.
Two years were scribbling in a notebook 
 its always bad and its never anything but bits and pieces anyway  You ever think that maybe its just making it worse? You dont wonder that?
I do remember something good. All the time. I remember you.
I dont mean that. I worry when you try to ignore it.
The Telegraph office.
We pushed it. We got lazy.
Back there  at the corner  Hyundai  silver 
 where? 
What if its not who you think it is?
There must be another way
Tell me later.
IS SHE RUNNING TREADSTONE?
They know  They know you were here. They know you killed these two guys. They know you and Conklin had something on the side. They dont know what it is but they know
It was Pamela Landys op. The guy was going to sellout a mole or something. I havent been debriefed on exactly what it was.
What do you mean?
You never worked Berlin...
Im working on it.
And the Germans cant match it?
Then get a number they need to know who theyre dealing with.
 the hotel  how far? 
I want to look at the room.  Check it out.
What?
 no  not me  no other people 
Thats where we came out.
For a thief. A mole. I vetted the source Marty. Hes real. If it does nothing more than narrow the list of suspects its a bargain at ten times the price.
I think that Bourne and Conklin were in business. That Bourne is still involved. And that whatever information I was going to buy in Berlin it was big enough to make Bourne come out from wherever hes been hiding to kill again.  Hows that scan?
Before this? Before Bourne? No.
Look what do you want me to say? I was there. I believed him.
I believed Jason Bourne had suffered a severe traumatic breakdown.
You mean did I want a date?
What do you want from me? I was reassigned. Im out.
And why is that?
Yeah thatll work...What the hell was he doing here?
Are we hacking or asking?
My brother and nephew perished two days ago when their hay cart turned over.
It was in Latin sir.
Youve all sworn to Longshanks.
So let the council swear publicly.
He has already agreed to come.
You are surprised he would lie? Balliol was murdered in a church yesterday. You are Longshanks new designate. You will be king.
I hear. This Wallace is a bandit nothing more.
I have ordered conscriptions...
Yes. I had thought that... I was loathsome to you. Perhaps I am. If I may be excused Mlord.
Wallaces followers.
Mornay has come. So will the Bruce.
Were here to stay. We dont care to live if we cant fight beside ya.
No. One of us is enough.
I wanna have supper waitin.
A common thief.
We dont split up
Confess and you may receive a quick death. Deny and you must be purified by pain. Do you confess? ...DO YOU CONFESS?
How do you know this?
He shouldnt be telling secrets in bed.
A magistrate wished to capture him and found he had a secret lover so he cut the girls throat to tempt Wallace to fight  and fight he did.
Its battle I want not talk.
A Lordship. And gold. That I should become Judas.
It will numb my wits and I must have them all. If Im senseless or if I wail then Longshanks will have broken me.
We all end up dead. Its only a question of how. And why.
No English lord would trust an Irishman
Come on I doubt the answers that simple.
How soon?...
I get the point kiddo. But Im not so bad am I?
Youll be fine. Dr. Redfield just wants to give you some tests. Youll like him.
Great. Ill see you soon.
Something mustve happened What set him off?
Dont try to use your blackouts to get out of this one
Please. He got straight As without ever touching a book. That was the one area where his memory never failed him.
No its just weird with him being such a brain and all I just wondered if he was ever able to remember stuff hed forgotten.
What? What could he do?
Hows Kayleigh doing? She all right?
Damn it Mom. I told you I need them all
Can you protect me?
Straight up.
Shit. I knew you were crazy.
No protecting her.
Photos?
Sorry dude. Just figured itd be okay with you bein sick and all.
Hes been acting real strange lately. He wont even look me in the eyes anymore.
Youll see.
I know Ive been actin strange lately. Its just that... I dont want anything to happen to us.
No. Just that you need to hurt me with it. Ive been where youve been.
You wouldnt believe me. I mean people always say You wouldnt believe me but in this case its not even worth trying.
Different? How?
I couldnt give a shit if you believe me or not and frankly Im too tired to prove it to you.
Then forget that. How about... you prefer the smell of a skunk to flowers you hate cilantro because for reasons unknown to you it reminds you of your stepsister.
Know what?
Sure Evan why not? You were the first person I really ever cared about.
When my folks split they gave me and Tommy a choice who we wanted to live with. I couldnt stand my dad but I knew if I moved to my moms Id never see you again.
...yes.
Been there done that.
Bullshit. Ill send you a postcard when Ive made everything perfect again.
Id say blow me. Get the pledges to do it.
I wont let you down Professor Carter.
Yeah. Ive been keeping journals since I was seven.
Deal. Now read me something.
Sure. I was gonna make a new one anyway.
Yeah good what else do you remember?
Forget it. Whats the point of Psych now? Tomorrow I could wake up as some dirt farmer in Bangladesh.
Fat little baby crying for mommy.
It wasnt enough that the whole world loves you but you had to take away the last person on earth who didnt think I was a piece of shit.
Right Evan. I believe you just said sick fuck.
Sorry Mrs. T. Hes been out of sorts lately.
I think Ill go check out the chapel.
Huh?
Where the hell are you taking us anyway? Just blow something up already.
Aw hey now that was a compliment.
Yeah you do that Lenny.
 Now just a minute. Who told you to ask me that?
Oh yes.
And he never knew and the girl kept this bad thing locked in her heart? That would be all right wouldnt it?
Oh yes please.
Thank you but I hardly think 
Goodnight Monsieur Rick.
 Tonight he forgot.
Er my check please.
Its not for sale at any price.
No hurry. Ill have it sent over. Have a drink with me.
Well youre in good company. Renault and Strasser probably think so too.
Its certainly not good enough. But since Im in a hurry itll have to do.
I shall remember to pay it... to myself.
Well good luck. But be careful.  You know youre being shadowed?
He is a difficult customer that Rick. One never knows what hell do or why. But it is worth a chance.
Good day.
And the other alternative?
How nice. You remembered. But of course that was the day the Germans marched into Paris.
He hasnt played it in a long time.
Looking for a job.
Its funny about your voice how it hasnt changed. I can still hear it. Richard dear Ill go with you any place. Well get on a train together and never stop.
Well I did. Every one of them. Mostly I remember the last one. A wow finish. A guy standing on a station platform in the rain with a comical look on his face because his insides had been kicked out.
You can believe that if you want to.
No Rick. No you see Victor Laszlo is my husband... and was even when I knew you in Paris.
I know how you feel about me but Im asking you to put your feelings aside for something more important.
It was your cause too. In your own way you were fighting for the same thing.
No.
 Youve got to listen to me. Do you have any idea what youd have to look forward to if you stayed here? Nine chances out of ten wed both wind up in a concentration camp. Isnt that true Louis?
I dont know. I aint seen him all night.
Victor Im afraid for you.
Please Ilsa dont be hasty.
I meant to but something always held me up. I love you very much Ilsa.
But no intention of selling them. One would think if sentiment wouldnt persuade him money would.
Yes. He said Ask your wife. I dont know why he said that.
 Yes?
I love you very much my dear.
Good evening. You see here we are again.
There is. I suggest that you ask your wife.
I said ask your wife.
We might as well question why we breathe. If we stop breathing well die. If we stop fighting our enemies the world will die.
Oh never mind about that. You wont have any trouble in Lisbon will you?
No. Please Monsieur it is a little game we play. They put it on the bill I tear the bill up. It is very convenient.
No. Two champagne cocktails please.
I was in a German concentration camp for a year. Thats honor enough for a lifetime.
Are you quite finished with us?
Then we shall state another time and another place. Tomorrow at ten in the Prefects office with Mademoiselle.
Whether or not you succeed is of course problematical.
Good day.
If Rick has the letters hes much too smart to let you find them there.
I have no conviction if thats what you mean. I blow with the wind and the prevailing wind happens to be from Vichy.
A leader like Laszlo?
But everybodys having such a good time.
Huh
Itll be interesting to see how he manages.
 Thanks. I will.
That was some goingover your men gave my place this afternoon. We just barely got cleaned up in time to open.
Well it looks like youre a little late.
Put it down as a gesture to love.
I am shocked shocked to find that gambling is going on in here
What friend?
Oh he wont be followed here.
Tell me when we searched the place where were they?
Just the same you call the airport and let me hear you tell them. And remember this guns pointed right at your heart.
You think of everything dont you?
Maybe but it seemed like a good time to start.
Our expenses?
Louis I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship.
I never make plans that far ahead.
 Sacha call a cab.
Take your hands off me
You will forgive my curiosity Mr. Blaine. The point is an enemy of the Reich has come to Casablanca and we are checking up on anybody who can be of any help to us.
They got a lucky break. Yesterday they were just two German clerks. Today theyre the Honored Dead.
For a price Ugarte for a price.
I dont mind a parasite. I object to a cutrate one.
Who did you bribe for your visa? Renault or yourself?
I like it fine here.
Yeah but I aint got time to spend the money I make here.
Then dont have a drink.
No I dont.
You said it  Heres looking at you kid.
Worse than Warsaw.
Take it.
Fix raft first.
Why do they have to die for me?
You quitter you quitter you quitter.
If I dont have a sea anchor Ill capsize.
Thank you for fucking up my life.
Nothing out there but ocean.
No.
Okay.  Sure.
Just sit here Ill get us some lunch.
You smell like formaldehyde.
Chuck forget the Xerox.  So Russia didnt turn out well?
I figure if we could take care of a puppy we could you know take care of 
A ring.  I wanted a ring.
Its our dog.  It belongs to us.
A week max.  Okay?  Okay?
The regular flight is scheduled for oh three hundred tomorrow.
Dehydration.  Vitamin deficiency. Protein deficiency.  Any or all of the above.
You bet I do.  High tide comes right up to this road.
Yeah.
Lets eat.
Come on down to the plant.  Its state of the art.  Were doing for chickens what FedEx did for the delivery business.

Theres settled folks and theres nomads.  Youre just not a settled folk. You never belonged here.
Roger got me on.  I wasnt doing anything and  but youre back youre really back.  I would have come to Memphis but 
Were on.
Im most definitely not dead.  And as I recall youre the sick fucker.
I never thought it would end.  Then it did.  It was so great to be saved I couldnt stop laughing.
Hallelujah.
Would you do us the honor of joining us? Were just sitting down at mess.  Pork chops and gravy cranberries baked potatoes with all the trimmings fresh baked bread apple pie...
Its because hes too tired to sleep. He has to.
She died of secrecy she died of ignorance...
Ill tell them Fuzzy was adopted.
I was lookin for Wallys letter. I was gonna show it to Homer...  They made him a captain already Captain Worthington
Good night Daddy.
Two.
I cant have a baby alone. I dont even know if hes coming back
It should taper off tomorrow but it can come back again. You have cramps?  Theyll ease up almost entirely. As long as the bleeding isnt heavy its normal.
Yes. But its closed all the time now because of the blackout.
King Kong. Its really good.
I did like it. All I said was Its not King Kong.
Well she was in a weakened condition...  I dont know What about King Kong? Is that medically possible?
Yes... and no. When you come here you dont really care about the movie.
Nobody will swim here until next summer. By then the water will have rubbed the glass smooth against the sandthere wont be any sharp edges.
It will be okay.
Im just waiting and seeing. Like you said.
No dontthats something. Nothing is nothing.  Dont even look at me. I want...
You got up You did something If you keep this up you might be in danger of making a decision
Please... thats enough. I loved you tooyou know I did.
You say that as though its some awful thing  I never stopped loving Wally
I dont need no more clothes thank you.
No. It aint Muddy. Muddys just...
Well this is an orphanage.
I know what youve been doing.
Homer liked it  Didnt you?
Homer was born here in what was it 1922?
Cirrhosisits a disease of the liver.
Why cant we have pumpkins for Christmas too? We dont get any good presents at Christmas anyway.
I dont remember.
Maybe I was kissing someone and he bit me.
I must have been dreaming of kissing someone.
A B24 Liberator.
Sure Be glad to Uh... a ride where?
Were heading back to Cape Kenneth.
The only jobs are picking jobs. Picking apples is truly boring.
Uh... actually picking apples is as much excitement as I want for a while. Im grateful for the job.
Okay. Then you can be of use.
Yes for both.
In other words scurvy.
Its your splice You blame me for everything
I wasnt intending to leave here in order to be entirely uselessI expect Ill find some ways to be of use.
Of course.
Its your heartyou ought to take it with you.
You know everything I know plus what youve taught yourselfyoure a better doctor then I am and you know it

I aint your business no more Daddy. Please let me go.
Oh god. Im overbearing and rude. Lily. Lily Finn.
Maybe you can help us understand whats so hard about getting a corporate loan.
They scare people off because most people lack vision. Vision and balls. Present company excluded of course.
We know exactly how were going to make the money back. There in lies the Catch22
The standard ten.
Gordo plays the inside. Youre the Shill.
Suits used to say that in any con sooner or later someones going to start asking the right questions. Usually it takes a little longer.
Cue the fucking violins. Come on... Its getting cold.
Youre pissed we didnt get credit?
I gotta work off some of this adrenaline. I got a line on this Pawn Shop guy over in Brooklyn. Anybody want in?
And what about Big Al?
We get fifty percent. And we get clear of the King.
So then Miles walks straight into the Creative Directors office and says The codes fine the programs for shit and throws down like a thousand pages of code on the guys desk
And all you need to do for your ten percent is put some paperwork through and push a button tomorrow.
Eight A.M. flight.
Id like this cashed please.
Jake. You can call me Jake. Here and there.
You know back in the day grafting was considered a gentlemans racket. Good suits good food... The Underworld of the Underworld. A grifter had to survive on his wits his instincts... I like that. I like the idea of that. These days things being what they are guys like me gotta stay low. Its all take take take. You cant just be fucking witty about it.
Of course your line of works only as good as the people you find.
Tip was fine Jake. We were a little more curious about the Fed.
Something stupid.
Jake. Jake Pearson. I go to lawschool with your daughter. Carolyn. We met once or twice.
Yyyou fucking shot him Thats what happened
You interested in a little work?
Take a deep breath and count to ten. Its not that kind of work. Youre Lily right?
Youre working Daffys block. He was going to break your kneecaps. Pick pockets can be so bitchy sometimes. I told him you were with us so thats two you owe me.
Gee thanks. Now I dont have to find that bridge to jump off.
Heres my deal  Dont waste my time. What do you want me for anyway? You dont even know me.
Hey I got it Take some mental notes. You just might learn something here.
What?
Youre just going to have to trust me.
Then show me how.
Honey this is Mr. Lewis. Carolyn Lewiss father. Mr. Lewis this is my wife Lily.
Its what I do. Its my job.
Good quality porn has its place in the world.
Then he grabbed me and threw me down on the floor that really cold linoleum tiled hospital floor and started ripping my uniform off.  He said he was going to fuck some sense into me.
You know why I told you that Jake?  Because I trust you too.
There are three people I trust  him him and a guy who got killed. I dont know who you are Youre like some stray dog that wandered into the house. So Im telling you to cut loose of this. No ones looking for you Not the King not Moonan and not Gillette. Just go wherever it is you would go. Its over.
What about what?
You sure were clear?
Just an idea but lets just fucking split. Well meet up anywhere. Akron or Austin or Atlanta. Anywhere...
How do you know the Kings going to let you walk?
Michelle Strigo. Loan officer.
There is no scam Ive got a fucking sign on my back I cant leave town now and come back with a suitcase full of money. You get it? Its over. We walk.
And we got rid of the red head.
Dont worry Ill settle up with your boss. We havent skipped town yet.
My fucking heart bleeds.
Let me ask you something... You really think Im going to come this close this fucking close and let my guard down? Ill get square with your boss. Ill get square with whoever did Al. Ill get square with everybody. Then Im going going to cash in my chips and be on my way to a new and better me far away from here.
Maybe hes got it right. Maybe were all just looking for a safe place to shit.
Eee Oott Auught
I saw you go up from the Knecker working that Grind learning the Barnards Law and I thought the kids a prodigy. But I know that if youre using these goods... So then I figure whats worth that? Youre either looking for a little history or a retirement fund. Whos the Mark?
I want to get out from under all this for good. And I want to fuck them all doing it.
A Fed? Is he close?
Look Im not a confrontational person by nature.
What do you get out of it?
To who?
All men are cheats.
Whats the Blue Book price?
Im not a mathematician. Im in business.
Get what?  Are you accusing me of cheating?
You want me drunk?
Its not just inner beauty is it?
Youve got such beautiful hands.
Its only hair. I havent changed.
Ill see you in my dreams.
Do you have to swear all the time?
Marion stop this.
Marion. Its a book.
Now wait a minute. Whats so hopeful about your job? Spending the day catching poor people stealing. You said yourself the organised gangs get away with it. At least in the casino everybody gets caught. Rich or poor the odds are the same. Its all relative.
You were talking in your sleep.
Then what?
Dont let yourself down.
Absolutely not.
I dont gamble.
Thats fine.
You choose.
What kind of trouble?
Was that why you did the two grand? I couldnt help you.
Forget it Jani. Itll never work.
Robberys not criminal?
Youre serious.
Wait a minute...
No thank you.
Jack Its Jani.
Sun City. Ive been meaning to call you for months.
Who did it? Tell me
Too much. Eighteen hundred.
Over the river.
Nice car.
Youve done pretty well.
Some other time.
I dont cheat Jack. Youve got it wrong.
That bitch? No.
Ill tell you later.
Wait a minute. You got yourself barred.
Has he?
Its the procedure here. Now sort the chips.
Any exceptions?
Five.
Five.
I said good call.
We had the same rule at Sun City but it was impossible to check.
Does know? Or does report? What would happen if I knew something like that and didnt report it?
How?
A pleasure. Pity about Bella.
I read that with a quantum increase of seven.
What flickering light?
Key? Key? What is the key?
Boiler were alive. My heart.
Time to start talking.
Not much. Nothing at all in this sector.
Well I show a 95 probability of sentient life in the Horsehead Nebula...
All right then...
Energy shielding positive function.
No.
I read you Lieutenant Doolittle but I am programmed to detonate in fourteen minutes. Detonation will occur at the programmed time.
But how do you know you exist?
Why that would mean... I really dont know what the outside universe is like at all for certain.
Yes well...
I recall distinctly the detonation order. My memory is good on matters like these.
Hmmm...
...nine seconds...
Yes Doolittle.
Doolittle...
I need a computer reading on a fail safe mark.
Any planets?
What?
Who cares. Dont bother me.
Out where?
Oh Ah yes Doolittle. What is it?
I dont like to go below since Commander Powell died. I feel enclosed down there. If it were big enough Id sleep up here...
They are a body of asteroids that make a complete circuit of the universe once every 12.3 trillion years. The Phoenix Asteroids... From what Ive heard Doolittle they glow... glow with all the colors of the rainbow. Nobody knows why. They just glow as they drift around the universe. Imagine all the sights theyve seen in the time theyve been travelling  the birth and death of stars things well never see. The universe is alive Doolittle. I thought it was all empty but it isnt. In between the stars its seething with light and gasses and dust. There are little pebbles drifting around planets no one on Earth has ever seen... No one but the Phoenix Asteroids...
Bomb must have gone off inside the ship. Nothing we can do about it now. Hey it looks like... the skipper. He made it. Commander Powell made it
Yeah?
Tell me Doolittle how are the Dodgers doing?
What was that Doolittle?
Sorry.
Oh yes Doolittle Im thinking.
No?
Im on a break.
Yeah sure I understand.
But the boss knows I always been loyal.
You didnt tell me you lived with her.
Where?
Dont look down.
Theo rode for this place a long time man.
I aint mad at you...
Just thought maybe hed like a little coffee with his saliva.
They took my daughter.
Like I said This isnt my regular line of work so Im making it up as I go.
Hello...
I dont want to move away.
Are we in some kind of trouble?
When?
No because its the Egyptian goddess Bast.
Now you know who I am where I live.  I figured I better find out who Im dealing with in case you were looking to hurt me.
Too early to tell.
Something.
You need to get out more.
How well do you remember the lab?
So you know the lengths hell go to keep her from going public... Im turning Lauren over to Canadian law enforcement tomorrow.  Theyll put her in witness protection but if youre with her the risk of her safety goes way down.
Somebodys got to.
I dont know what to say.
She may be easy on the eyes but shes trouble trust me.  Hot run to twoohtwo Sansomme.
Oh?
How sweet.  Standing by your man even after what he did.  Youre a very understanding person.
Youre also a fool.
Now heres how its gonna be Lydia. Youre gonna take your threats and your acrylic nails and youre gonna go home and figure out your marriage instead of trying to make other people feel as miserable as you do understand?
I understand.
They dont exactly have a search engine for finding a bunch of kids with bar codes on their necks which is something Im not even going to ask about
No but I broke a nail giving him a cranium crack and that just sort of wrecks your day know what Im saying?
Besides think of the drama Im sparing Natalie.
But of course theres nothing self serving in that scenario.
Ill bet you can.  Sit.
Quite a mouth on a girl so young...  ...but my guess is talking is not what it does best.
I told her its just business to you that all you want is a reasonable solution to this.  You give her daughter back she agrees to leave the country.  I play the guarantor drive her down to Mexico tonight and put her on a train to Brazil or wherever.
Shes gonna need to know that her little girls alright.
Feel like the dogs dinner.
What if hes on the level?
But theres another side
Im the victim here.
Who either doesnt care or could have me killed.  Either way Natalies still gonna find out.
Or I dissolve into an angry hysterical wreck who never wants to see your lying ass again which is probably what would really happen.
You dont.
Easy Sketchy.
Lydia may not have been one of humanitys finer specimens but
None of this wouldve happened if you had exercised even a smidgen of good judgement or selfrestraint which you didnt.
You were trying to have it both ways and you were being completely selfish.  And if I ever find out youre going out the back door on Natalie again youre the one whos gonna be hanging by your ankles three stories up.  Understand?
Shutup...
I was on call. 
Hes sick.
How bout you dont break my sneakers on this.  The guy is seriously not well.

I dont remember.
Well maybe I am a little headstrong...  But you know its awfully hard to forget what he called me. 
Oh your Excellency you take me off my feet.
Why  why  of course.
Dont bother me  Im thinking  What was that?
THIS IS TREASON  What a fool I was to listen to your siren song and fall a helpless victim under the insidious spell of your irresistible charms 
Well no  not exactly  but 
I didnt come here to be insulted.
This is terrible
My dear niece  I must ask you not to interfere.  War is not a womans problem.
She has the face of an angel... She was an angel. She was so kind... so kind to me. Its not her fault for in the fourth month of her maternal condition she was knocked down by an elephant. Im sure I must have been a great disappointment to her.
No I think a whiskey.
I dont know. I cant explain it. If this is an intelligent man trapped in the body of a monster then Im under a moral obligation to help free that mind free that spirit as best I can to help him live as full and content a life as possible. But If hes an imbecile whos body I cant treat and whos mind I cant touch well then my obligation is discharged. They can put him where they will he wont be bothered I wont be bothered and everyones conscience can remain free and untroubled. And that is my dilemma... what is in his mind?
Hes sick Bytes. Hes going to die.
I intend to.
Right... Right.
No sir hes got bronchitis and hes been badly beaten.
He neednt. I have no desire to cause him any discomfort. Did you make those inquiries we spoke about?
Do you think theyll go along with us?
Of course. How long did you and Mr. Treves prepare for this interview?
Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies Thou anointest my head with oil...
Oh nothing... nothing of any great importance.
Youll know presently. At the meeting of the society. But until then I beg of you Fox keep it to yourself.
Hes imbecile no doubt from birth. He speaks but... its all gibberish. No the mans a homeless idiot...  I pray God hes an idiot.
Oui dat de tongues of de mans is be full of deceits.
Ive brought you some things. I hope youll like Mr. Merrick. I hope you dont think it too forward.
Well you must go. It is one of the most beautiful places on earth. Of course Im rather partial.
I fear not Mrs. Kendal. Even in the short time he was gone the size of his head has increased rapidly... as is his pain.
Yes. There is nothing more frustrating nothing that makes a physician feel more useless than standing by watching his patient deteriorate. And when that patient is a friend no... no theres absolutely nothing I can do.
Yes.
Good morning.
Yes.
...I learned a long time ago.
Thats much better. I could understand that yes.
Very good Oh yes Now listen. Im going to say some things to you and I want you to repeat them... um... I want you to say them back to me. Do you understand? Im going to say some things to you and I want you to say them back to me. Do you understand?
Excellent Now say... Hello
John Merrick.
Say Mmmerrick.
Hello my name is John Merrick.
Very good very good. Now when your visitor comes today I want you to say it exactly the way you said it just now. I will introduce him to you and you will say the words youve learned. If you have any trouble with any of the words Ill help you. Im sure youll be just fine. If you do as well for him as youve done for me these last two days then Im sure our visitor will be very pleased. Now lets go through the whole thing again shall we? I will say May I introduce you to Mr. Carr Gomm. And you will say...
Good evening. Very well thank you. And you?
I promise you. You will never see the inside of that horrible place again. You will never ever go back to the workhouse... or that man. Its a splendid room dont you think?
How is your tea John?
Of course.
Your mother?
Good morning.
Yes John.
Mr. Treves tell me... tell me truly. Is it alright did I make any mistakes that you can see?
Yes The workhouse
Not quite yet Mrs. Mothershead. There seems to be some difficulty this morning.
Yes. John wants it.
John thinks its very dashing. Something no gentleman should be without. Im inclined to agree.
YOURE NOT LISTENING TO ME I aint done nothing wrong. People pay to see your monster Mr. Treves. I just take the money.
I dont think so. No sir were closed.
Never mind. Im the owner.
But one day Ill catch you... Like I caught her...
Well my dear I think youll find its all a question of what you want to believe in.... I have slightly more experience of these matters than you...
These? What are THESE? Theyre swords.
What... you mean got into bed with them?
The fifth one this week
Ill bring it back.
Goodbye Aud...
But Aud... I... I came to find someone...
The sun is up beyond the clouds  where it always is.
And youre not just saying it because you think we want you to?
Yes?
Theyll be more than hurt if Halfdan the Black lands Ow
Dont talk nonsense.

Yes Mum.
Yes Mother. Goodbye Dad.
Shes punishing me for being honest. I should just go to her house.
Say hi to Naomi.
I did. You said things were fine.
I told you that later.
Why?
No I mean I dont know. I cant really think of much to say probably.
Well Im there. I hide in the back as much as is humanly possible. You have a cell phone? I need to quit right this minute. Ill call in dead.
Ill go on the dole. Like my daddy before me.
Ah the hair.  Blue right? Its called Blue Ruin. The color. Snappy name huh?
I think. Anyway Ive tried all their colors. More than once. Im getting too old for this. But it keeps me from having to develop an actual personality. I apply my personality in a paste. You?
Well you dont know me so... you dont know do you?
Im Joel.
Im not nuts.
Oh. I dont know. I was just... I dont know. I was... You seemed nice so 
Very much.
No stay. Just for a little while.  Refill?
I do have a tendency to use that word too much.
Yeah. I think so. Its hard to 
Yes.
Tonight. Just to test out the phone lines and all.
Fuck you Joel. Faggot.
I want to have a baby.
I dont want to talk about this here.
Its you Its you who cant commit to anything You have no idea how lucky you are Im interested in you I dont even know why I am I should just end it right here Joel. Leave you in the zoo. Maybe you could find a nice sloth to hang out with
No. Thanks.
No.
What do you mean?
Hide me somewhere deeper? Somewhere buried?
You had the whole human race pegged.
I still thought you were going to save me. Even after that.
Yeah I know. Im fishing.
And you picked it out of my plate before I could answer and it felt so intimate like we were already lovers.
Yeah like that.
I dont think Ive slept in a year.
I think shes great.
Yeah yeah. It goes Perhaps there is someone in this world to whom I could send all these lines?
I walked out the door. Theres no more memory.
I love you.
Tomorrow?
Make love?
Oh um...
Hey Joel 
Says you would sometimes disappear all night then brag to me about your sexual conquests.
What old mill? Is that somewhere we 
I just walked in.
Im like a joke to them.
Clementine. I should just maybe talk to her.
I couldnt believe you did that. I was paralyzed with fear.
I didnt want to go. I was too nervous. I thought maybe you were a nut. But you were exciting. You called from upstairs.
Im trapped in my head and everything I love is being erased Stop it now
I think maybe were both so used to operating at this level that  How can one person be unhappy? If one person is unhappy both have to be... by definition.
You didnt miss much. Rob and Carrie say hello.
I hope you get your work done.
Its been a pretty lonely couple of years.
Oh Great. Thats great
Well speak soon.
Hi Mary. Hows it going?
Hi.
Sorry. I just 
Then why did you ask me?
They have a right to know. Howard is a thief. He steals the truth.  I cant remember my baby I cant remember my baby. It existed and I cant even remember. Do you understand that?
Yes?
Is that Nietzsche?
Its no big deal.
Okay. Good. Great. Thanks.  I like you Howard... an awful lot. Is that terrible?
Ive got a wife Mary. Kids. You know that.
We... have a history. Im sorry. You wanted the procedure. You wanted it done... to get past. I have to finish in there. Its almost morning. Well talk later.
The guy were doing? Hes disappeared from the map. I cant find him anywhere.
I was away from the monitor for a second. I had it on automatic. I had to go pee.
December 15th 2004. I met someone tonight. Oh Christ I dont know what to do. Her name is Clementine and shes amazing. So alive and spontaneous and passionate and sensitive. Things with Naomi and I have been stagnant for so long.
Yeah probably a good idea.
Maybe after the holidays then.
Not a dump then but kind of plain. Uninspired. And theres a stale smell. Sort of stuffy. I dont know. Stuffy.
You can if you want.
Jesus Patrick
Maybe if you stopped stealing their panties.
Its a quote book.
Patrick were in the middle of 
Clockworks.
The Clock People?
Ha ha ho ho and hee hee.
How am I going to be the progenitor of a tribe when Im living on an isolated ridgetop with Delores?
Im staying with the Countess.
Drugged is a stupid word.
What guy?
I have to go Julian.
Tired...
A born freak can only go uphill.
Does that mean you might have an assignment for me?
Shit O dear thats enough to make me asthmatic. The nerve of those twits. What do they know about female odor? Dont interrupt. Heres my concept. My ranch out West? Its a beauty ranch. Oh its got a few head of cattle for atmosphere and tax purposes. But its a beauty ranch a place where unhappy women  divorcees and widows mainly  can go to lose weight remove wrinkles change their hair styles and pretty themselves up for the next disappointment. My ranch is named the Rubber Rose after the Rubber Rose douche bag my own invention and bless its little red bladder the most popular douche bag in the world. So get this. Its on the migratory flight path of the whooping cranes. The last flock of wild whooping cranes left in existence. Well these cranes stop off at my little pond  Siwash Lake its called  twice a year autumn and spring and spend a few days each time resting up eating doing whatever whooping cranes do. Ive never seen them understand but I hear theyre magnificent. Very big specimens  I mean huge mothers  and white as snow to coin a phrase except for black tips on their wings and tail feathers and bright red heads. Now whooping cranes in case you didnt know it are noted for their mating dance. Its just the wildest show in nature. Its probably the reason why birdwatching used to be so popular with old maids and deacons. Picture these rare beautiful gigantic birds in full dance  leaping six feet off the mud arching their backs flapping their wings strutting low to the ground. Dears its overwhelming. And picture the birds doing their sex dance on TV. Right there on the home screen creations most elaborate sex ritual  yet clean and pure enough to suit the Pope. With lovely Sissy Hankshaw in the foreground. In a white gown red hood attached and big feathery sleeves trimmed in black. In a very subdued imitation of the female whooping crane she dancewalks over to a large nest in which there sits a can of Yoni Yum. And a can of Dew. Offcamera a string quartet is playing Debussy. A sensuous voice is reading a few poetic lines about courtship and love. Are you starting to get it? Doesnt it make the hair on your neck stand up and applaud? My very goodness gracious Grandiose lyrical erotic and Girl Scout oriented you cant top it. Ive hired a crew of experts from Walt Disney Studios the best wildlife cinematographers around. Youre my eternal favorite. Princess Grace herself couldnt be better not even if she had your personality which she doesnt Anyway dear Im out of photography now and into water colors. Ah how circuitous conversation is Were back at the beginning. The exact man Ive wanted you to meet is my artist the watercolorist.
What makes you think this watercolorist and I would develop a romantic relationship?
So if the ship didnt blow up what happened?
Uh yeah Coop Im still here.
Justin?
Coop where are you...
What about the accumulator...?
Im telling you I saw it...
Goddammit DJ it was not a hallucination I saw a man he was on fire. And then he disappeared.
Its not a distress call. Its a warning.
Hear what?
Oh God...
A power drain 
His peritoneum has ruptured...
I apologize for the short notice Bill but weve had something come up that requires your immediate attention. Lyle?
Navigation Control tried to hail the vessel. This was the only response.
Its been two years since she died. Hes over it.
The dark inside me.
How do you know all this?
Dr. Weir Admiral Hollis would like to see you as soon as possible.
So where are they? Starck any luck with the bioscan?
Skipper...
Do it.
Justin.
Captain I didnt come out here to sit on your bridge I need to be on that ship...
In an emergency the charges detonate in series destroying the central section and separating the personnel areas from the rest of the ship. That way if the gravity drive malfunctions the crew could use the foredecks as a lifeboat.
Negative.
Its possible that a burst of gravity waves escaped from the Core distorting spacetime. They could be what hit the Lewis and Clark.
If it worked yes.
The Event Horizons computer thinks its 2034.
Check the Core for radiation. Carbon dioxide may be the least of our worries.
Youre insane. Youve lost your mind.
Starck... Cooper...
Thats not it. That ship was built to go faster than light... Thats just wrong it goes against everything we know...
Love to.
Smith where the hell have you been?
Get outside go back to work. Ill join you shortly.
Captain we got a problem.
She was right behind me I turn around shes gone. She could be anywhere.
Lets go.
I just finished drying...
Whats causing the readings?
Not acceptable. I want to know whats causing those readings. If the crew is dead I want the bodies I want the crew found.
Dr. Weir you were right there you must have heard something seen something...
There was a another surge in the bio readings right before you... you saw what you saw. We picked up a similar readings right before the Clarke was damaged. What if there were a connection between the two? The gravity waves the hallucination all part of an defensive reaction like an immune system...
Whats going on in there Starck?
Hes awake hes in the airlock hes not wearing a suit.
You better hurry. Hes engaged the override we cant open the inner door.
Five seconds.
Whatever was on that bridge wasnt Weir.
Blow it up?
Yes.
Hes been past Mars?
Isnt it possible that you were traumatized by finding the body on the bridge?
Not according to the computer.
Skipper Justin just activated the door. Its on a thirty second delay...
Shes not ugly.
It still has air and reserve power we can activate gravity and life support.
Picking up magnetic interference.
Explosive decompression.
Hmmm. Claire used to tell me I loved the Event Horizon more than I loved her. I told her that wasnt true I just knew the Event Horizon better thats all.
It wants me. I have to go.
Im alright. Please.
I like the sound of that.
Is it safe?
Oh he did.
Its not him. Its them.  I cant live like this.
Victor mustve taken him.
Dont come any closer for a sec. This is gonna be kind of a shock... You remember when we said together forever no matter what?
Deb its me. Its still me.
This wasnt our first stop in case you forgot NASA. And Victors not that bad. Hes just a little...  Larger than life.
External SRBs orbital system engines. Its just like the shuttles you flew in 
Should?
Three days. I was worried about you. How are you feeling?
Yeah you and Debbie and perfect 
Ben I dont know if this thingll change us back or make us worse. I need you to be patient for a little while longe
Theyre fine. Everybody else... is fine.
Give me the god damn mirror
Ive never felt better in my life. When do you get off work?
Stay right. Left is trouble.
Ben are you there?
Act. Here we go again. Reed what if we got these gifts for a reason? What if we have some you know... like calling?
Grow up Johnny. You want to run around on fire for the rest of your life?
You were at 4000 Kelvin. Any hotter youre approaching supernova 
Blockhead started it
No Im sorry for pushing you out.
Showtime.
Sir Im sure he wouldnt put himself 
Actually uh people seem to think the scar humanizes you.
Thats why. Because I could have any other woman... You know when they asked Caesar why England he said because its not mine.
Never better.
Its been changed.
Yes thanks.
What? What do you mean you 
We need to get past them.
Im sure I can come up with something.
What in the world would give me that idea?
Of course. Of course.
With the right energy we can stabilize the storm. Maybe tie into the city grid...
No way to know. Without more tests experiments.
You need a doctor.
Hilarious.
Hes had some kind of... reaction to exposure from the cloud. And hes not the only one.
Which is precisely the point. Analysis is over. Its time for action. My men could have massproduced this by now.
I told you Im fine. Its you Im worried about.
Im just saying I know what its like to lose something you love. To see it slip away and know its never coming back.
For your sake I hope youre right. Im sorry if that sounds a little skeptical.
I can probably get you in there. Just let me talk to Dennis Taylor.
Look Brad Ive been trying to think of a way to tell you this. Were almost out of high school this is our last year. I think we owe it to ourselves to be free and meet some new people. Then if we get back together well know its the right thing.
Come on Spicoli. Why dont you just put your shirts back on? See the sign?
First door on your left
Dont strain yourself.
Id say... who the hell is Ron Johnson?
I dont care it you tell me or not. I got problems of my own.
Maybe yes. Maybe no.

Fascinating.
You know the thing I love about Mustangs? The steering wheel.
Really?
He was hot wasnt he?
No way He just called him a dick.
It was okay.
Boy I am so glad to be through with all these games.
Not since November.
Youre right. Probably penis mouth and neck.
Im not going to tell him. Hes an asshole. I hate him.
Stacy hes not a guy.  Hes a little prick
Come on. Theres lots of men around here. Keep your eyes open.
Yeah like maybe never.
Theres a world of guys out there. I just wish I didnt have to date any of them.
Yes.
Thank you Desmond.  Whats the reason for your truancy?
Learning about Cuba. Having some food.
Yeah. The Graduation Dance Mr. Hand. Its the last school event of the year.
No way mon. When I graduate U.S. history I aint even coming over to your side of the building.
I know everyone says that.
No problem.
I dont know. Wherever you want.
It is. Its very warm. I wonder how long it will last?
I think Ill have the Seafood Salad Special.

Two more Cokes.
Todays April 16th. Damone never comes to school on April 16th.
John Bonham. The drummer for Led Zeppelin. He died a couple years ago. Every birthday he stays home and plays everything John Bonham ever recorded. Its like his own holiday.
You did the right thing. Never try to understand a press message. About half the time we use codes  especially with Dr. Gonzo.
Listen you fuzzy little shithead  Ive been fucked around in my time by a fairly good crosssection of meantempered rulecrazy cops and now its MY turn. Fuck you officer Im in charge here and Im telling you we dont have room for you.

Why what?
Wheres the ether? This mescaline isnt working.
Dogs fucked the Pope no fault of mine. Watch out... Why money? My name is Brinks I was born... Born?

Shit. I met her on the plane and I had all that acid.  You know those little blue barrels. I gave her a cap before I realized... shes a religious freak... Jesus shes never even had a drink.
Youll go straight to the gas chamber. And even if you manage to beat that theyll send you back to Nevada for Rape and Consentual Sodomy. Shes got to go.
Thats good. You cant be subtle in this town.
...and every one of them stacked naked...
They were all veterans.

Two glasses of ice water with ice.

Better that way... for me.
Worse.
Yes. Very close
You speak.
How did you find me?
I see it before me.
There was something at work in my soul which I do not understand.
Wed travel north my bride and I. To the furthest reaches of the Pole where no man has ever set foot. There we would live out our lives. Together.  No human eye would ever see us again. This I vow.
What does it matter? Shell live again. Youll make her.
Shes not for you.
So have I
Elizabeth. If its true travel into Germany would be banned. Youd never get near Ingolstadt.  Besides theyre only rumors.
Fine.
Let this locket be a token of the vow we took the night I left.  Hes coming home to marry me.
Its far too late for him to still be out.
Quite a sendoff isnt it?
To be the best there ever was. To push our knowledge beyond our dreams... to eradicate disease and pestilence... to purge mankind of ignorance and fear...
Not as weak as I.
They knew the risks when they signed on. Ive come too far to turn back now.
Do you foresee this happening in our lifetimes?
Oh God.
These are exciting times Henry. Were entering an era of amazing breakthroughs. Look at Edward Jenner. He wasnt content to bleed people with leeches he pioneered a new frontier of thought
But you havent listened Never in history has so much seemed possible. Were on the verge of answers undreamt of... but only if we have the courage to ask the questions.
Thank you Henry.
And is it true Miss Moritz that you love Victor Frankenstein? That your heart was broken?  Answer the question. Do you love Victor Frankenstein?
Is it also not true that you murdered his brother William in a misdirected crime of passion?
You have a way of provoking his.  Ive been watching you. You seem impatient with your studies.
You disdain accepted wisdom?
But the possibilities. Combining ancient knowledge with new? Something like this could change our fundamental views
The strain was evident.
Are you a physician?
Wouldbe. Im plagued with my share of difficulties just at the moment.
You know of it?

Whats an official cross? Some piece of tin made in Taiwan? What makes that official? If a cross works against vampires its not the cross itself its what the cross represents. The cross is a symbol of holiness.

Smoke her.
Fuck me.
Did you hear?
I was one member of the investigating commission.
That aside for the moment Im struck by the tenor the illspirit of your report... the degrading remarks by other aviators... innuendo about her performance in unrelated situations... even a reference to her sexual activity the weekend prior.  In my seven years on this committee Ive never seen a downed aviator treated like this.  Never.  Im deeply disturbed by this report Mr. Hayes.  Not just what it bodes for women in the military  but for your own confirmation as well.
My office will fill him in and help expedite.  Look forward to meeting you at the proper time.  Jumping off now...
Yes dear.
Lieutenant Thomas Wickwire.
What he did was light the bandwagon on fire.  Because he knows what I know  that American families are not prepared to put their daughters in harms way.
Im saying its not going to happen. Not when the President is set to turn this into a thirdrail issue should I choose to ever campaign against him.  He will fry me six ways to Sunday for sending daughters and young mothers off to war  and quite possibly for bringing them back in body bags.
Im sure it is.
Fuck.  BasherBasher this is Ground Crew Six requesting emergency extraction. Stand by for a PRC fix...

That you would have known you can trust me.
Because they have hardly any uniforms they designate officers with colored ribbons.  My lord.
The British  These men cannot stand against them
Thats Greene.  Hes supporting our reconsolidation.
To learn to shoot cannon?
Colonel Hamilton.  Anyone who served under Arnold I want them shipped north.  I dont want any troops here who served under Arnold.
Did you know that Arnold left the entire defenses of this fort in complete disrepair?  Most of our cannons are so neglected they may as well have been spiked?  You realize what would happen if this fort fell?  The whole Hudson would be open to them
March on Philadelphia  Get Joseph Reed and the pigs in Congress the speculators whove grown fat off the war  Get them all  Sweep them aside
Im not sure.
As does your ability Horatio.  We must talk further when its more convenient.

I see...
An Oldsmobile Silhouette.
Yeah well this ones the Cadillac of minivans.

Into air bags. Theres no cushion under what youre doing. Im out of it Cat. Im done.
Just do what I told you and meet me back here at midnight.
No. Whats this?
I gave him a key to a locker that had the money in it.
Because there were a zillion DEA guys hanging around the terminal.
Harry let me answer that.
Its what he said Im his associate.
What about her?
Theres nothin to know. You have an idea you write down what you wanna say. Then you get somebody to add in the commas and shit where they belong if you arent positive yourself. Maybe fix up the spelling where you have some tricky words... although Ive seen scripts where I know words werent spelled right and there was hardly any commas in it at all. So I dont think its too important. Anyway you come to the last page you write in Fade out and thats the end youre done.
Lemme see if I got this right you break into Karen Flores house ask me for three hundred grand doesnt even belong to you?
Gimme an hour.
In the can. That the money?

His shrinks trainer.
Yeah he wants us to talk to Buddy set up a meeting.
I found him.
Who?
Ask your man here.
One of mine?
With what? Wiseguy money?
Yeah but you havent found him yet.  The guy took off for Las Vegas.
Its not that simple. You have to be careful. Theres another guy that comes along a hardon you owe some money to. A mob guy. Wants to take you out anyway on account of a past situation.
At eighteen percent okay? And dont ask me no more fuckin questions. Im leaving.
I know who he works for. Wheres your phone.
I know what a vig is.
...Thats what we finally decided.
I married Martin. That was a full time job.
He must mean after Slime Creature 3.
Dont go out of your way.
How bout Get Shorty? Except that isnt a movie. Thats real life.
Yeah. Theres a girl in it now.
Whichever. Lets talk about it tomorrow.
What happened?
You said dont say nothing and I didnt.
Im thinking about producing.
I dont think the producer has to do much outside of maybe knowing a writer.
Whatta you mean whose point of view The audiences point of view.
Yeah me too. He was a helluva good writer. And I would know. I discovered him. Made him what he was.
No. But now that you mention it I did talk to a handsome executive at Paramount the other day... who just happened to get his hands on the script.
Harry 
Hes telling me an idea for a movie. Its not bad so far.  Sit down have a drink.  Tell Karen lets see what she thinks.
Thats where you got the idea?
Yeah thats what we need. More agents.
No problem. You go on off to bed.
Shylock?
Hello Martin.
Yeah Karen knows him.
Arctic Warrior passenger vessel Chimera was lost at sea day two month two year one nine five three.  Over.
Roger that North Island. Arctic Warrior whiskey alpha sierra bravo four zero niner two. Over and out.
Take it easy Dodge. Its only a piece of metal.
Morning skipper.
Shes so big somebody could come alongside her on the other side and wed never know it.
Lemme see was that before or after the oil fire?
Supposing one of those cables breaks under tow.
Gimme a break.
Why not?
Sounds reasonable.
I gotta pull the blades and reseat everything in a new rotor  .
A salvage claim to a vessels cargos as valid as a claim to the vessel itself. Its ours.
It looks like it.
What is it?
With all due respect skipper.  Part of that up theres mine. Id kinda like to have a little say in what happens to it.
You smashed it
You didnt want us calling anybody. Too liable to ruin your big payday.
Conveniently enough for you.
Right.
Show your tatoos to that coxswain last night did you Epps?
Hed let you off at the nearest port thats for sure.
Because of the gold.
Nothing. Lets get outa here.
They mustve scuttled it. Nobody just lets a ship float away.
Maybe. But theres always somebody whose interests at stake.
The guy. He just came this way.
I saw him. Just a minute ago. Some guy.
Possibly false. Hence the IMA record of being lost at sea. I dont think mutinys out of the question here.
But who  ?
But wheres the damage?
If it was a ship she hit.
Let em ask. This ships legally ours now.
Hey.
Never mind. Before your time.  I think at least some of the crew went a little nuts. The usual stuff that happens when people stumble on a fortune. Equal parts greed and paranoia usually resulting in homicide. What happened after that is anybodys guess. But judging by our Greek friends down below it doesnt look like the last time.
Maybe it was one of them did the handy work on those Greeks.
Victims of what?
Epps over.
Hes not on deck and I cant raise him on the radio.
Right here.
Maybe it was more than that.
Crazy with greed. Not crazy. Not like him.
Go.
Theres a large vessel out about ten miles to the northwest.
So we cut her loose and wait it out. A little weather couldnt be anything she hasnt seen before.
And look what happened.
A what?
Mustve heard something below deck and went down to check it out.
Leave it.
You think whoever did this is reasonable?
Fine with me.
Whynt you mind your own business chief.
You pump it out and reseam the hull shell be good as new.
Fifteen at the most.
Nope. What are you making pancakes?
Its tough to find a good job without any kind of training.
How should I know?
Who?
She understands what youre going through and she really wants to help you. She says that job at Computer Station is still available if you want it.
But I cant 
Uh no. I missed that one. But what do I know? I like Laurel and Hardy movies.
Please tell me it isnt that teenager
I cant believe this I thought at the very least a guy like you would never pull this kind of shit on me
Help me what?
But... can I still get that scholarship to the Art Academy?
Why? What difference does it make? You already got his money...
Look I already told you Im not going to give you a ride.
No.
Can I come in?
Are you trying to get me wasted so you can take advantage of my womanly charms?
Then why do you hate me so much?
Why do all guys have to play stupid guitars? Its so typical... Either theyre into cars or guns or sports or guitars... its so obvious...
I thought Chipmunkface was never going to shut up.
What?
Why?
How perfect.
Just look at them
I know it hasnt really hit me yet.
God its so totally pathetic.
God thats so pathetic. I bet she didnt even notice him.
We should call him and pretend to be the redhead.
I know look at the way he drives... hes like an old man.
Its still twentyfive minutes early.
What exactly is a cardigan anyway?
Oh my god he just ordered a giant glass of milk
Hes still just sitting there. God this is totally unbearable
We should follow him home.
Gross
Forget it I cant explain it...
What is she black now?
You just want an excuse to dress like some stupid fashion model without me making fun of you.
Lets go hassle Josh.
Its not like Im some modern Punk dickhead... Its obviously supposed to be a 1977 Punk look but I guess Johnny Fuckface is too stupid to get it
Everybodys too stupid
Hey you have to see my new good luck charm.
This morning at Seymours garage sale.
Where?
I dont know... Some people are okay but mostly I feel like poisoning everybody.
Hes a total asshole... He doesnt even need that wheelchair hes just totally lazy
Or maybe... did you ever think that deep down we really might be lesbos? Maybe thats why we spend so much time together.
Which one?
...maybe we should be lesbos...
Wasnt it like eighth grade?
We were such desperate sluts back then.
I told you  my manager was a total asshole Dont worry Im going to get another job... and anyway I have some ideas for how to make money in the meantime...
Oh yeah right like Im gonna let some asshole with a goatee own Goofy Gus.
I thought we decided that Josh was way too cool to be interested in sex and that hes the only decent person left in the world and we would never want to bring him down to our level and all that...
No matter what happened it would be a big disaster... Lets just try and keep everything the way it is.
I cant imagine spending money on towels.
What are you talking about? Who?
I dont know God dont act so jealous I only talked to him for two minutes.
Well what am I supposed to say? I cant wait to live in some depressing shithole in the middle of nowhere?
Youre the one whos still living out some stupid seventhgrade fantasy
Well we wont keep you.
Oh yeah like he even noticed.
Thats okay...
Seymour does.
I thought it wasnt for sale.
I know its over asshole I 
That tape sucked by the way
Yes.
Youre late asshole.
Hey where are you going?
What?
I dont have anything after about 1935. I may have one Hindu 78 from the twenties in my collection but its not really for sale. I dont really collect foreign.
Sure I guess.
Nah its not so great. Heres the one Id recommend.
The Skip James record? Yeah thats a masterpiece. There are no other records like that I actually have the original 78 of it in my collection. Its one of maybe five known copies.
Watch my stuff.
I... I didnt think you would have any interest in this get together... I mean if you had told me you were coming I would have warned you  its not like a real party or anything.
Yeah well sure... you can if you want to... its just I dont want all these guys in there at once... you know...
Please... go ahead and kill me This stuff doesnt make you happy believe me.
Oh right...
I dont know what kind of question is that? I mean its totally irrelevant because a girl like that would never be caught dead with me...
Shh
Cmon Seymour please?
That thing is just so shrill and piercing and loud  its like someone jabbing me in the face  KFTO comin atchya on this beautiful evening...
Yeah well its simple for everybody else  give em a Big Mac and a pair of Nikes and theyre happy I just cant relate to 99.9 of humanity.
But its not totally hopeless for you... Ive had it. I dont even have the energy to try anymore.  You should make sure you do the exact opposite of everything I do so you dont end up like me...
It doesnt matter Im not staying long... I just want to make sure I convince you not to give up yet.
If you dont mind my asking  why do you care so much if I get a date or not?
What?... Oh that... I borrowed that from work about fifteen years ago... I guess its mine now.
You work at Cooks Chicken?
Jesus Id go nuts if I had to work in an office all day.
No in a lot of ways things are better now... I dunno... its complicated. Everybody still hates each other but they know how to hide it better or something...
Thats the spirit
Oh yeah?
Who knows?
How can you be so sure?
Its just that well you know Dana just got out of a really bad relationship and I dont want to give her the wrong idea... you know...
I dont think you understand how I really feel about you Seymour.
Can you at least let me in?
Look I just need somebody to be nice to me for five minutes and then Ill leave you alone.
FUCK DANA. Im sick of Dana.
What are you talking about? Youre disappointed every minute of your life.
Yeah but still... its kind of insulting for a girl to be ignored like that.
But I...
Forget it theres no way... find some other poor sucker to abuse.
He has every reason to freak out  this is a totally fuckedup thing to do to somebody
I wish I could see him.
Its a found object... thats when an artist takes an ordinary object and places it in an artistic context and thus it becomes art.
I guess I see the teacup as a symbol for womanhood because of tea parties in the olden days but instead of tea I was trying to kind of confront people with this... like...
Right exactly
Are you sure she wasnt there?  Maybe she was just hiding from you.
Hell replace you too thats all you really care about.
As are they all.
But I have in India every country presents problems.
Dont they though?
Yes he is.
In point of fact it didnt.  But Im convinced the theory is sound.
All theyll bring is more chaos and weve plenty of that already and if they come in word will get out and what happens to your knighthood then?
Karim will have to show me where it happened. And of course Ill need the donkey.  With any luck Ill sort it out tonight. 
please you neednt be so graphic
I suppose I could answer you. I suppose I could explain that the place is so inviting what with the smell of blood and flesh that they have to strike. Its even possible that I tell you I found some fresh paw marks around back which means theyre already contemplating feasting here.  But I dont want to answer you because when you question me you are really saying that I dont have the least idea what I am doing that I am nothing but an incompetent that I am a fool.  Anyone who finds me a fool please say so now.
Were not much good at goodbyes Helena.
What if there are complications?
The females are bigger only animal here like that have to be or they wouldnt survive because the males eat the young.
Just that they fart through their mouths.  Must make kissing something of a gamble.
Have you got that in writing? 
And anxious to get started.  What is this mostly malaria?
We know three things about maneaters. First they always return to where theyve attacked before. Second theyre always old they cant catch other animals so they turn to us. And third theyre always alone theyve been cast out by their pride because they cant keep up.
You mean nobody died?
Nonsense Samuel would have done something. 
No but you do  see you were needed after all.  And fifty warriors at the camp before dawn.
Has it ever done that before?
Dont they have to be?...
The most of any lions... a hundred...?  Probably more.  Johnny...?
Get on? They detest each other. Obviously the Africans hate the Indians. But the Indians also hate the other Indians. Some of them worship cows while others eat them. 
Thank you Samuel.
I dont believe you had a mother. 
Four should do it.
Actually Im not eating lunch today.  I have an appointment.  In fact Id better go.
Hello Dana.  I happened to be in the neighborhood and I thought Id stop by to see if everythings all right with you  you know with the blackout and everything? Are you okay?  Is the baby all right?
We dont have a relationship.
Does he ever mention me?
Okay lets take a look.
You are personally responsible.  If I can get conjugal rights will you visit me at Sing Sing?
I didnt paint it.  Im just cleaning it. Its an original Ver Meer.  Its worth about ten million dollars.
As a matter of fact I stopped by to tell you that I havent forgotten your problem and that were still on the case.
Yeah its not the kind of thing youd want to hang in the rec room.  You know what it needs?  A fluffy little white kitten in the corner.
I dont know what to do anymore.
Really?  And how would we handle the sleeping arrangements?
I put them in your hamper.  I thought they were dirty.
I want to stop getting involved with men who arent good for me.
Why do you say things like that?  Youre so much better than you know.
Your alien had a room in the Holiday Inn?
Now youre talking.
How are you?  Whats that youre working on Johnny?
Well Id make an exception in this case if I were you.
I know.
Yes the scourge 
 the sorrow 
Yes.
Hi its really great to meet you guys.  I know this sounds weird but once I had a dream that my grandfather was standing at the foot of my bed but I knew it was impossible because he died and he started to tell me that 
Well I think its important for people to know that the world is in danger.
No I guess Im just saying that shit happens and somebody has to deal with it.
Yeah you would.  Is that for personal or professional reasons?
They love you Lib.  Keep it up.
Im worried.  The vibrations could shake her to pieces.  We should have padded her feet.
Why dont we try the Gigameter?
It may be ebbing and flowing from some tidal source.
And were the ...
Thats it.  Its on the bottom.
You mean this stuff actually feeds on bad vibes?
And its all flowing toward the museum.
Theres something very familiar about this painting.
Oh just checking something for an old friend.
Who?  Just  someone we know.
Aaah  Nobody  I cant tell you
Okay lets heat em up
Im Peter 
Ill get one more reading.
You just picked up three penalty points on your drivers license.
Were almost there Lib.  Step on it.
No I just thought 
Yeah I guess so.  It was the strangest thing.  I knew what I was doing but I couldnt stop.  This really terrible feeling came over me and  I dont know  I just felt like driving into that tree and ending it all.  Whew  Sorry boys.
Dont you see?  Its the slime.  That stuff is like pure concentrated evil.
You think all those predictions about the world coming to an end in the 1990s are true?
I dont know.  It probably wouldve been the same.
No thanks Louis.  Im really tired.  Ive been rehearsing all morning.
I thought I turned it off.  I guess I forgot.
I am Zuul.
Thanks.  Whats in there?
What?
Well lets check it out.
I know.  Youre quite a celebrity these days.  Are you here because you have info ... about my case?
The stiff?  He happens to be one of the finest musicians in the world and a wonderful man.
Ill cancel the reservation  I found the name Zuul in ...  The Roylance Guide to Secret Societies and Sects.  I dont suppose youve  read it.
Ill pick you up at your place.  Ill bring along the Roylance Guide  we can read after we eat.
I am Zuul.  I am the Gatekeeper.
Really?  Cant wait to meet him.  As long as were waiting for him Id really like to try something with you  in the bedroom.
Well Ill just use it for a while and get it right back to you.
I am Zuul.  I am ...
Dr. Venkman we believe that the purpose of science is to serve mankind.  You however seem to regard science as some kind of dodge or hustle.  Your theories are the worst kind of popular tripe your methods are sloppy and your conclusions are highly questionable.  Youre a poor scientist Dr. Venkman and you have no place in this department or in this University.
Yes.  Im Dr. Venkman and this is Dr. Stantz.
Die in what sense?
I dont care.  I see us as tiny parts of a vast organism like two bacteria living on a rotting speck of dust floating in an infinite void.
What calls?
Here are tonights calls.
The EPA?  Whats he want?
You could say that.
A square?
You volunteered didnt you?  Arent we paying you for this?
Were you recently in the bathroom?
Im always serious.
Shes telling the truth  or at least she thinks she is.
Didnt see anything  Didnt get anything. Nice girl  no ghost.  Im starting to worry.  You said your graph was pointing to something big.  You told me things were going to start popping.
If you turn that thing off we wont be responsible for the consequences.
She said he was the Destructor.
And look at this Peter  Coldriveted girders with selenium cores.
Peter at 140 this afternoon at the main branch of the New York Public Library on Fifth Avenue ten people witnessed a freeroaming vaporous fulltorso apparition.  It blew books from shelves at twenty feet away.  Scared the socks off some poor librarian.
No this ones for real Peter.  Spengler went down there and took some PKE readings. Right off the top of the scale.  Buried the needle.  Were close this time. I can feel it.
What do we do now?
Hey Lady?  Lady  Can you talk?  Who are you?   This is not working.  Think of something else.
Let me tell you Ray everything in life happens for a reason.  Call it fate call it luck Karma whatever.  I think we were destined to get kicked out of there.
But at nineteen percent interest  You didnt even bargain with the guy.
Maybe.  But no one ever advertised before.
It wasnt a date.  It was an investigation.
So far all we got is a shit smell on the twelfth floor and we almost fried a Puerto Rican bellboy.
Forget the trapping  Just blast him
The StayPuft Marshmallow Man  He was on all the packages we used to buy when I was a kid.  We used to roast StayPuft marshmallows at Camp Waconda
Uh ... Oh these are blueprints of the structural ironwork in Dana Barretts apartment building ... And theyre most unusual.
And the seas would boil ...
If you get me pregnant with a boy hell be a double direct heir and will end up killing you for the throne.
Im sure I dont know.
Why not do it in the Colosseum?
Taking my pleasure.  Do I need to clear my lovers with you?
Why are you so surly  youve won brother.  The people have bread and the city is quiet.
Gladly Caesar.
We have to stop the Germans now
Ill nose around...
Thats their job isnt it?  To argue.  So I think my case will be long on talk and short on action.
That makes his birth sign... Virgo Why thats the sign of a little girl  Can you tell my readers more about your starcrossed connection with Emperor Commodus?
I need to give you my word when yours is worth nothing?
You dont know how wrong you are.
Narcissus  Terrified?  You?  The only thing hes scared of is me.
I dont believe that.  Hes got the best doctor in the world and a will of iron.  You know were preparing for a fullblown invasion of Germany.
Yours will do
Do you remember your Epictetus that little homily we recited when we were children?  The one that was supposed to remind us we were Romans?
The fort helps position us for a final invasion in the spring when theyre most vulnerable.
I will Marcus.  But youre going to be well enough to direct it yourself.
So I understand.
They fear me.
Ill do anything in my power to help you restore the Republic but I cant be that power.
Well we can try...
I cant let you do that.
The people? listen to the people they know what they want  A government that gives them what they need and doesnt bother them with messy thoughts of issues.  You know messy... thinking.  They want a dictator  As far as the children there is only one thing that every Roman child dreams of  being you A famous gladiator
Isnt the helmet magnificent?
Greeks?
I can see that...
Who else?  Im the one who runs the estates while youre here risking everything we have for the glory of Rome  Or for the glory of you
We dont need your help were doing great on our own.
No
You are to be killed exactly. Theyll give you a sporting chance but just enough to make your murder... entertaining.  Romans like to mix their metaphors  laughter with their executions you know?  If you survive though you will become a gladiator.  A gladiator at least gets a fair fight.
Chain him.
I didnt get killed and everyone else did.
So I pretend Im dead.  You get gold what do I get?
As what The Galloping Gladiator?
On you  Of course  You are my bravest fighter  the best fighter I have ever seen
I can really rape them on this  Can I at least tell them youll think about it?
Ill do it  Sure as theres shit in the Tiber were all going to die but for you  anything
Are you mad?  With all this unrest the Colosseum will be open day and night  Anyway Im not political Im in the entertainment business.
Yes.
Im sorry I took you in there.
But Elaine 
No I couldnt.
Wait a minute.
Im trying to think of where theres a place to have a drink around here.
Of course there is. Look  The Veranda Room  right there.
Lets get out of here Elaine. Lets go somewhere else.
Youve got to go over the back fence and Ill meet you on the corner.
Get out of here.
At the Zoo.
Well I have this very pleasant room on Carter Street  and Ive been getting to some classes 
Did you say rape her?
Elaine  right now I dont feel like talking much. Im sorry about everything but I think Ill just do this now.
My belt.
I dont know.
No.
I dont know.
Yes.
Ill think about it.
Benjamin  I havent even said Ill marry you yet.
Why dont I just drag you off? All right  I will. Right after we get the blood tests.
No Benjamin.
Shhhh.
What?
Listen to me. I am Dr. Smiths brother  Reverend Smith  and I am supposed to perform the ceremony. I just got in  from  Portland  and Ive forgotten what church  you see?
Mr. McQuire.
Yes sir.
Not exactly.
I am going to call the police now.
What?
Look  I drove you home. I was glad to do it. But I have some things on my mind. Can you understand that?
What do you mean?
What?
Like what?
So?
All right. Now finish your drink.
Yes.
We had it done last Christmas. Would you like to see it?
No I dont. But I just feel a little funny.
Benjamin  Im not trying to seduce you. I wish youd 
Ive got to go.
Of course.
Nervous. Well I am a bit nervous. I mean its  its pretty hard to be suave when youre

I havent. No.
Why dont I get it? Well  I will then.  If youll excuse me.
Benjamin.
Benjamin.
Thats a laugh Mrs. Robinson. Thats really a laugh. Ha ha.
Are you kidding?
If you want.
Well I just dont think we have much to say to each other.
Well what do you want to talk about?
Do you want to tell me about some of your college experiences?
You start it off. I dont know anything about it.
There
I walk out.
What?
Thank you.
See if you can guess.
Art.
Kind of.
How do you think.
It was a Ford Benjamin.
Why not?
Benjamin dont you ever take that girl out.
Well look. I have no intention of taking her out.
Well its pretty obvious you dont want me around any more.
Thats all right. I think I can understand why Im disgusting to you.
But if its sickening for you 
Benjamin  I thought I made myself perfectly clear about this.
Im sorry we wont be able to invite you to the wedding Benjamin but the arrangements have been so rushed 
Very good sir.
When I go off?
Goodnight.
Next time he suggests it Ill tell him I have no intention of ever calling her up in my life.
Oh Ben  this is so  exciting 
About an hour ago.
About what?
No. I think youll want to wait on that.
Ben  how old are you now?
I wish I was that age again. Because Ben 
Youll never be young again.
Ben can I say something to you?
Quite a while.
Yes sir.
Oh yes.
No its not 
It was nothing to do with you sir.
Dont shout at me Ben.
Yes I can.
Id like to discuss this.
Ben says he and Elaine are getting married.
That what he says. Right?
Every glass high to life  the splendid dangerous mighty brief  brief life  and the courage to live it.  Baron you know  Ive only lived since last night  but that little while seems longer than all the time before  all the  
The pearls are in her room.
Ive been careful Ive been waiting my chance.
Youre no good for this business. Its just a joke to you...
With the pearls?
Not with strangers.
Dictation.  You know...
No  why?  should I?
Very little.
Where downstairs?
Sorry.
Chasing what?
Then dance the next number with Kringelein.
I fell in love last night  the real thing.
I thought that too  but I found that it does. Come along dance with Kringelein.
For tonight. 
What do you want here?
Id like to smoke a cigarette.
That is not so  you dont want to be alone. 
No  You dont want to be alone at all  You were in despair before  If I left you youd feel worse than you did before You must not be alone  You mustnt cry  you must forget... Tell me that I can stay with you  tell me.
Because I can see something in the mirror that you cannot. My dear  
Im a prodigal son the black sheep of a white flock  I shall die on the gallows.
I know.
I wanted money desperately  Can you understand?  Thats why I wanted the pearls. I was threatened  I was desperately in need of a certain big sum of money. Ive been following you  Ive admired you. But I have forced myself not to think about you  Last night at last I managed to came into your room and  and now.
Yes  If I didnt believe that Id die after last night.
Oh  yes but  later.
Never mind  Ill get it. I have a whole day. Ill be on that train.

Not at all sir. 
Im Baron von Gaigern.
Yes quite.
A little strange Baron.

Youre tired. I can see that.
Yes thanks to the Baron. The best shops the very best. Look Doctor silk  feels so nice on the skin... a London hat see  made in England thats silk too  fifty marks... Look the price is on it. That was half my salary before. The Baron is a very fine gentleman  no one in my life has been so nice to me as the Baron.
Everything?
Ill take the bank  All right gentlemen.
Waiter oh waiter Wait a minute  We are having caviar  its expensive but that makes no difference  I see the Baroness is laughing.
Oh can anyone engage you for the evening?
Shes beautiful  isnt she?
For the first time in my life Im happy.
You dont like to see me enjoying myself.
You dont understand that do you?
What?
Moreover the possibility of the successful termination of negotiations now pending with the Manchester Cotton Company...
Thatll be all  be here tomorrow at nine oclock. 
Well?
You mean Baron von Gaigern?
Why not?
Very simple  Ive always liked the way you dressed Preysing  English isnt it?
They turn out marvelous material in Manchester.
We are here to discuss our merger. Naturally I can make no statement at this time. We must begin at the beginning.
All you have to do is phone for it.
And I said we didnt.
Mop rags  mop rags  were interested in something quite different
Youve decided against the merger?
Why talk  its over  its over  its finished. Youve broken off negotiations. You did it. Youre calling them off. You had nothing on your mind all day but Manchester  Manchester  Manchester.  You dont suppose for one moment that Im such a fool as not to have something that I could say definitely about Manchester. 
Gentlemen I am now free to announce...  ...that the deal between my firm and the Manchester Cotton Company has been successfully negotiated.
Under these circumstances its quite a different matter.
Next week.
Foggy  frightfully foggy always Im told.  Have you said anything about Manchester Mr. Preysing?
Youve talked enough today youre hoarse now.
He likes to play the great man.
It will pass  it will pass  come.
Oh Suzette  Suzette  Sshh  quiet.
Goodnight Suzette.
Im cancelling the engagement.
The house is not full  Is it really full?
Why not?
You havent time.
No  no  wait  the man was a burglar  he was going to steal my money.
I can answer for this it was self defense  I can answer for this  but that girl  the scandal  my wife  my daughters you know them?
I wont wait  I cant wait  I waited three days before I got a room at all and what a room that is.
No I wont wait  I cant  Every day is precious  every hour  Every minute.
The troupe the scenery everything  all on board waiting. You have a rehearsal in Vienna tomorrow morning. Come Madam are you mad?
No news yet?
I saw Gerstenkorn at lunch  and as your lawyer I made it my business to broach the matter 
Well  gentlemen.
You let me talk till Im hoarse and you had Manchester sewedup all the time. Why?
He left home a long time ago. He was in the hospital up in Los Ang gleez real sick.
On the square huh? And how are you making out these days? Stealing much?
Or else hes working an angle. If he doesnt steal a little hes steeling big.
Well you can tell them I said theyre right.  I better get going. Royll wonder where I am.
I like you too.
Hah.
Good evening. Id like a single for tonight.
Goody
So here we are
I must admit Mister Fellowes I had moments I was worried.
My son will be all right. If he isnt Ill have you killed.
Delmar? I never go out to California. Thats a thousand miles from here.
Maybe Ill swing around Los Ang gleez on the way.
But they must be They cut glass
I have only one thing now. Are you interested?
Thats just the first year. If you arent worth a lot more than that the second year Ill kick you out. What do you say?
Oh sure. Fine.
Perk.
The truth is Mr. Kaggs 
You do not Roy Dillon? Cornball clown pictures? Commission salesman? Its all a front isnt it? Youre on the grift I know you are. Youre working some angle and dont tell me youre not because I wrote the book
The first day of the Delmar meet there was a nag called Bluebell. I should have been on it. But that was the day after you came in here so I stuck around to see how you were gonna be.
You dont have the stomach for it.
I pay my debts.
Ive really got to 
Bobo wont be. Hell spend the money to make sure.
As though you do what I say.
This ways perfect.
Youve already made a start. Doesnt look that clean though.
Dont be sorry. Youre not taking it.
You must have some money.
Far enough. Maybe up to San Francisco. Or St. Louis someplace new. Start over.
Not very good
I gave you your life twice. Im asking you to give me mine once. I need the money.
I dont?
My wife sent me here Myra. For the money. Shes waiting.
Are you sure?
No baby. Come to Mama.
You already went back to work.
I was teamed ten years with the best in the business. Cole Langley.
And when he got serious?
Join up with you I watched you Roy Ive been watching you wondering if I should talk about this at all or maybe just... 
You and me Roy. What a team well make. We think alike we get along together. Once or twice a year we take some slob the rest of the time we live like this. You wont regret this Roy.
What?
No Because I 
For Christs sake why not?
Yes?
Well mostly I dont believe it.
One thing I have to caution you about. A gunshot wound...
Sickness comes to us all Mister Dillon.
That dont match either of the victims.
Unable to escape she turns and attacks the killer but doesnt connect.
Broken blood vessels on her right forearm.
Its Blake.  How do you feel about Wisconsin?
Id prefer you didnt.  Im very busy.
Well I can assure you it wont happen again.  Thanks for your concern.  Goodbye.
Well Eddie Catero didnt show up for work this morning... parents say he never came home last night. Cars still missing.
What the fuck are you talking about?
Who are you the serial killer police?  What difference does it make?
My blood pleasure.  You scared the hell out of me.
You sure?
Nothings missing?
Betcha didnt predict that.
Just forget it...
Will sit down...
John...
I came to see you.
Yeah.
I know.  Im really really sorry Miss Tate.  Please let me keep the job... its the only way I can afford to stay here.
Who?
What?
Oh right.  Sorry.
Cant it wait till Monday?  I thought maybe we could dance...  Im very light of my feet.
Big time.  And news travels fast. Wouldnt be surprised if the whole school knows about this one by tonight.
Wasnt scaring the hell out of me once today enough?
Another episode of Daddy Knows Best at the Strode house.
We were worried about you guys so we left early to see if you were 
Relax.  Everythings cool.  Didnt I tell you Harry would be here?
The voice man  Hes here
But Ive seen him
You cant expect us to stay here 
Danny
Lock the doors and call your husband. Get your family as far away from Haddonfield as possible.
Mrs. Strode Michael Myers is here to kill his family.  And he wont stop until you are all destroyed.  I only thank God that I found you before he did.
Its ... Michael ...  ... Michael Myers
No please listen  Theyre coming ... coming for me and my baby.
Danny go downstairs  Now
Him.
Why would anyone want to kill an innocent baby?
Its a rune ... Thorn.
When applied directly to another person Thorn could be used to call upon them confusion and destruction  to literally visit them with the Devil.
Kara no
Thats the whole idea of living in the country.  I thrive on the seclusion.
You should know that its not wise to play Halloween pranks on me.
You dont know that for sure.  It could have been anyone.  A practical joke. Kids.
It was you.
Dr. Loomis thank God youre here.  You heard her didnt you?  It was Jamie.
Only me    and Dr. Wynn.
Didnt recognize you.
Home.  Jesus.  Im like this.  Home
How all the magazines show tits today.
Tell them yourself
I sure didnt expect her to drop dead.
Really?
Sorry.
Of course  Not only go to it but go to it in full uniform  Rent a uniform
I dunno. You know.  I used to really love that Alice. Do you know that?
If what?
What?
It would have been fun to see you drop your rifle and run the first time an elephant charged us.
Youre hollow like a woman.
He can shoot  He can hold his ground  He can attack  Youre in your proper profession right now sucking up dirt for frumpish housewives closet drunkards every one.
Out
Dad was never in England?
The sting.
Tell me that.
Dr. Woodly says hes seen hundreds of children permanently injured by football.  He says that when theres a war everybody goes but football players.
Oh no no no no no.  It cant be. How embarrassing.
Sir?
Shes a real heavy sleeper sometimes.
Penelope
Damn.
Your mother and I do not wish to be disturbed for three full hours.
Nothing.
I think so daughter.  How old are you?
A springbok an oryx a gemsboka gazelle.
Raw hamburger pleaseand a whole onion.  I want to eat the onion like an apple.  Do you understand?
Did you ever daydream that you would one day meet a friendly millionaire?
DaughterI love you very much.
Destiny often seems that way. Youre going to marry me.
Give us time.
I dont know.  This is a new disease to me.
A telegrama phone call might have helped.
Youd better get Dr. Woodly.
We thought it was an emergency.
Buy yourself breakfast.  There we go.
You shouldnt have talked to Norbert that way.
I have a brain.
What a honeymoon.
This is not a coy deception.  I do not want to be scrogged.  I want love.  I want tenderness.
Id like to have the expert opinion of the fishalong with yours.
Well I can.  Some injuries spiritual or physical can be excruciating to me.  Im not a silly carhop any more.  Maybe youre right about fish. When I was a carhop I didnt feel much more than a fish would.  But Ive been sensitized.  I have ideas nowand solid information.  I know a lot more nowand a lot of it has to do with you.
The whole concept of heroismand its sexual roots.
Yes.
No youre not
If he wants to go.
It isnt a matter of liking.  Its a matter of getting used to death as a perfectly natural thing. Would you mind leaving?  No woman ever walks out on Harold Ryan and then comes backfor anything.
Hope.
It seems highly intelligent to me.
Sounds quite beautiful.
Like what?
Then youd better fix your bayonet because there arent any bullets in the gun.
There it is.  Give it to me.
Hello Mother.
Oh dear.
She still has just the one child the boy?
And what exactly is your relationship to Mrs. Ryan?
I came back.
Whose son this is whose wife that is.  A fianc is the most ridiculous appurtenance this household could have at this time.  Good night.
Are youve seen it work cures?
Its healer to killer.  Is that the same thing?
Now whos being cruel?
Yeswelluhthats another one of those statements which more or less automatically requires an apology.  Whenever you feel like it. Its sort of like turning off an alarm clock thats ringing loudly. Your apology turns off the alarm.
And terror if you dont mind.
In any event I will not beg for mercy.
No. WOODLY The magic root you gave meI had it analyzed.  It was discovered by a Harvard botanist in 1893  He explored your famous jungle for five years armed with nothing but kindness a talent for languages and a pocketknife.
And the hell with it.  It was so tragically irrelevant so preposterously misinformed.
Never.  For when you began to kill for the fun of it you became the chief source of agony of mankind.
Oh Godyoure really going to kill me. HAROLD It wont hurt as much as the sting of a bumblebee.  Heaven is very much like Paradise they say. Youll like it there.
Thank God. HAROLD Crawl home.
Its trash now like mine.
Jesus.
WellI walked up to the front door. I was still alive.  Big surprise. I rang the doorbell and old Mrs. Wheeler answered.  She had her Goddamn knitting.  I said Guess who? She conked right out.
Yeahcripes.  I never did get any sense out of Alice.  She found me holding up the old lady dead as a mackerel.  It was a bitch.  You knowmaybe Mrs. Wheeler was going to die then and there anyway even if Id been the paper boy.  Maybe not.  I dunno boy.  Thats civilian life for you.  Who knows what kills anybody?
HoneyAlcoholics Anonymous takes all the time Ive gotand Harold Ryan is an individual I would rather forget.  He drove me to drink.  He drove his first two wives to drink.
Ja?
I dont care what she wears.
She doesnt care  Shes not married any more  Shes going to have fun  I hope you have so much fun you can hardly stand it.  Dr. WoodlyI hope you make up even better jokes about my father than the ones youve said so far.
All my dreams have suddenly collapsed.  We did have a lot of laughs together Penelope.
Stay home tonight
If you have to go out with some guycant he be more like Dad?  Herb Shuttle and Norbert Woodly cant you do better than those two freaks?
Youre the only woman he ever took out.
Still lives with his mother.
I was afraid to ask.
Its beautiful.
No.
That man is your father.
Shivers and sweats and groans.  His teeth chatter.  Whatll we do?
I apologize.  But you didnt know him and neither did I.  Hows your asthma?
Hows the fungus around your thumbnail?
He is my father.
Something happens to my confidence.
Thats when Ill get my confidence back.
Yeah.
He ditched me.  He started running and I started running then he lost me in the park.
Its dark in there. PENELOPE And thats where he is
Before he started to run.  He said his father carried a key to this apartment around his neckand someday wed all hear the sound of that key in the door.
He told me to take a flying fuck at the moon.
Youre saying no.
Whats so wonderful if I lost the sale?  You poor kid.
What?
It is?
Why would you do that?
Weve got to rescue him.
Ohlook at the poor crucified violin would you?
You fake  Youre no better than the dumbest general in the Pentagon.  Youre not going to beat Harold. Youre not going to beat anybody. Youre not going to stay here eitheryammering and taunting until youre most gloriously killed. Go home
That maid just quit.  The place is a mess.  You can start in the master bedroom.
Mozart plays shuffleboard.
Jack the Ripper plays shuffleboard.
Big threat. TV would ream you.
Do you have any particular choice of girl?
Are you going to stiff me?
Look that twenty dollars you just paid I dont get any of that. That goes to the guys that own this place. I get two bucks an hour minus ten percent for a bail fund. I make all my money on tips.
The rate is a dollar per line a dollar and a half bold face.
Overpowering?
Yes. I think itll look better.
Well next time you talk to him tell him to pay his actresses more.
Sure. Like in Mikey and Niki. Did you see that picture?
Yeah.
Three hundred?
Okay. My client pays for it anyway.
I dont drink but you can go out.
Shes dead.
At least Im a growing person.
You never met a working girl before have you? You think I like sucking off guys all night? Maybe I do. So what?  You cant even say it can you?
Sucking off.
You and I Niki have very different ideas about sex.
You really believe all that?
It doesnt make any sense to me.
Why cant I meet him now?
On your own land?
Just a guess. She aint dead though is she?
Well what do they know?
So then Mr. Mast...
...What do you have to offer?
What do you mean?
I dont know.
You like this dont you. Showing me... this.
Research my ass. I suppose these are the extra expenses Ive been paying for? And in the middle of the morning too.
Get out.
Nah. They dont care about some faggot hustler. Theyre more interested in your daughters health  and yours. Like I am.
Its just a name.
Go home pilgrim. Theres nothing you can do. Forget this place. Start over.
What?
I was told that there were certain things that only Ratan could provide.
Lets go.
What?
I dont know. Look man if youre looking for somebody maybe you ought to see the cops.
My secretary said you wanted to discuss a business proposition.
Film making can be pretty expensive...
Oh.  Why is it that you want to get into film financing?
Its cool. Why do you think I got in the movies? How much poon do you think you get in the car wash business?  Look fifty thousand dollars buys a lot of pussy. You can get your joint pulled by beautiful girls every night for the rest of your life for fifty thousand dollars. So why fuck with the movie business?
Dont get me wrong. A couple years ago I woulda jumped at fifty thousand dollars possible financing. But the Lords been good to me. I can now finance any films I choose. Big ones small ones. Right now were setting up a two hundred thousand dollar feature film. Live sound. I like to keep my own money in my films. That way you dont have to share the profits. Theres plenty of guys in town thatll take it though. But if I was you Mr... what was your name again?
Calm down mister. You dont want to get the cops in here do you? You got a family?
Why dont you just go outdoors mister? Cool off.
You never heard of that?
Youre taking a big chance.
No Andy. Dont know the kid.
Was. He and that shitheel Ratan went down to TJ. Maybe I shouldnt say that. Anyway I hear hes back in Frisco now.
Yes thats good planning. Tell me are you a regular Candy in this computer club?
I just dont think we have one unless its in the glove compartment. Could you look Harold?
You too Buster. Stand over here. Lady youre in a heap of trouble. I have you down here for several violations speeding resisting arrest driving without a license driving a stolen vehicle possession of a stolen tree... Wheres the tree?
I see the eternal goddess of beauty and love. I see Aphrodite. The consummate woman.

Oh its only a machine Harold. Its not as if it were ualiveu like a horse or a camel. We may live in a machine age but I simply cant treat them as equals.  Of course the age has its advantages.
That little tree. Its in trouble. Come on.
Is he all right?
No more revolts.
Yeah. And it is cold in here. Hello Glaucus.
Yes. Its almost there.
Its all right.  Its organic.

Traitor Benedict Arnold Remember Nathan Hale right sir?
Scared? Swimming underwater with that oxygen device of yours. I was petrified.

Well not udyingu actually. Im changing. You know like from winter to spring. Of course it is a big step to take.

Does that worry you?
Ah yes.
Im sure. But what else do you do with your time? Do you go to school?
What about the draft?
I dont know.
I go to funerals.
Yes.
Yes.
No.  Id have liked to.
War is not all black.

Ruins. Not rocks. The remains of Trondham Abbey. Built on an intersection of Ley Lines the boundaries between our world and the other 
Air and sea backup. Whats closest?
From where??
Spiritual advisor to the Romanovs.  In 1916 at a dinner in his honor he was poisoned shot stabbed clubbed drowned and castrated.
I know where to find him. Ill get him back.
Dont worry. Ill get him soon enough 
In the absence of light darkness prevails. For there are things that go bump in the night Agent Myers.  We are the ones who bump back.
Youre doing fine.

Thats right.
No.
I prefer the floor.
Whats wrong?
Steve.
I said I found a room.
Im not going to change my mind Dad.
What for honey? You know we can look after you. Youve made the gesture 
Ive forgotten.
Shes not like Mom. Shes... I dont know... moody. I thought that was what you liked about her.
Sure.
Whats the problem?
If theres a train.
Oh I dont know. Uptight. Frigid.
Oh no.
I beg your pardon?
Say it.
Since when did this shop become a fascist regime?
Rob.  Top five musical crimes perpetrated by Stevie Wonder in the 80s and 90s.  Subquestion  is it in fact unfair to criticize a formerly great artist for his latter day sins?  Is it better to burn out than to fade away?
Oh so whats the point then?
Bullshit.  The guy was going to buy one record  which we didnt even have  and leave and never come back again anyway.  Why not have a little fun?  Big fucking deal.
I wanna live with a musician.  Shed write songs at home ask me what she thought of them maybe even include one of our private jokes in the liner notes.
Thats fucking great Barry.  We can spend fifteen bucks on a cab to save five each.  Fantastic Barry
What do you mean what?
Oh no Rob thats not obvious enough. Not at all.  Dick did you hear that?
Ooh  A kind of recent record  Robs sly declaration of new classicstatus slipped into a list of old classics Nice Lets Get It On? Couldnt you make it more obvious than that?
Lets pack it up.  We havent had a customer in four hours.
Yeah you would say that wouldnt you?  You two have to stick together now.  Boners United.  United in getting some.
Suck my ass.
Barrytown.  Barrytown?  Is there no end to your arrogance?
You cant be called Barry and sing in a group called Barrytown.
Id want One Step Beyond by Madness. And You Cant Always Get What You Want.
Havent seen it.
No.  We need the gig.
Were not called Barrytown anymore by the by.  They got sick of the BarryBarrytown thing.  Were called SDM.  Sonic Death Monkey.
Oh yeah.  We got it.
I have all of the others.
Nothing.
Nothing.  I just prefer the other one.
Isnt her album called Number Four With A Smile?
No no no you said The Number Four With a Smile and theres no The at the front of the title of the album.
We work there
Anna Moss.  Mossy.  The Mossy Thing. The Swamp Thing.  Is she all green and furry?
Just that Rob seems to think it would be wiser to start a record label by putting out a record with business crippling Nazi Youth shoplifters than with someone he knows in his bitter jealous heart is a musical visionary.  Thats all.
Thats five.  So.  Why did you decide to deejay again?
Music for Old People. What does that mean?
Oh well the Kinky Wizards are  you know what?  Why dont I just make you a tape?
Oh hi.  Hi Rob.
Well Ill just make it for you.
The new Belle and Sebastian.  Like it?
Yeah.  Im sorry... Look Dick Laura and I broke up.  Shes gone.  And if we ever see Barry again maybe you can tell him that.
Fine.
Liz hold on a second   What?
 FUCK OFF
Conflict resolution is my job Laura.
Come on Rob.  My relationship with Laura has obviously disturbed you a great deal.
Yeah sure.  More so then than I am now.  Thats life though isnt it?
You really believe that?
Good.  So.  Is it my job?
So what you havent definitely decide to dump me?  Theres still a chance well get back together?
So we have a chance of getting back together again.
Fine.  One.
Just ask it
Will you please just go?
Have you slept with him yet?
I dont have your number.
I think the big question here is where are you if you dont mind my saying so and I think I know where you are.  Youre running.  On the run.  Youre running from a point that everyone hits in any relationship and youre just going to hit it again with Ian but its going to be with a World Music bunny rabbitlooking earthshoewearing Doctor Whowatching twit who doesnt really understand you not the way that I do and will more in the future and youll have just wasted more time and arrive in the exact same place that youre in now only later. And with... him.
It was kind of funny.
That bad eh?
Hey how ya doin?
I cant talk right now.
Mmnn.
I didnt mess things up because I was scared.  I slept with Ray because I was sick of you.  And I needed something to snap me out of it.
I dont want to go back.
I want to feel something else than this.  Its either that or I go home and put my hand in the fire.  Unless you want to stub cigarettes out on my arm.
Itll have to be sex then.
Everythings too hard.  Maybe another time I would have the guts to be on my own but not now I dont.
I know its not very romantic but there will be romance again at some stage Im sure.  I just... I need you Rob.  Thats it.  And we know each other and we care for each other and youve made it clear that you want me back so...
Well I was gonna lie and now I cant because youd know I was lying.
Hey great idea.  What Ill do is tomorrow Ill get a hold of a box full of mint Elvis Presley 78s on the Sub label and Ill pay for it that way.
At Paul and Mirandas.  Paul from work.
You had no right.  Supposing I was doing something that couldnt be cancelled?
Its no joke.  Im responsible for what happens you know.  Embarrassment aside theres a lot of money and effort in this at least by my standards.  I have to put down a deposit for the room.  I have to pay the pressing plant for the records sleeve them sticker them 
Not really.
I mean it.
Oh well thanks a fucking bunch.
Not in love exactly but...
Right.  Okay then.  Shall we go?
Im just sick of thinking about it all the time.
This stuff.  Love and marriage.  I want to think about something else.
Its gonna be fine.  These people are ready for anything.
Hey.  Its Liz.
You called this morning?
Its a crematorium.
What difference does it make?
God I hate that time.  That pick up stuff time.  I just went through that before I came here.  You know that song Patsy Cline Times Two I play?  Thats about me and my ex dividing up our record collections.
Yeah I know the Crumblers  I bought a used Blasters album in New York about ten years ago and somebody left a Crumblers single in it.  My everything changed for a couple of weeks.
Yeah.
God you ask a lot of questions.
Well call her mother.
Im going to drink this bottle of wine watch TV and go to bed.  Then tomorrow Ill get up and go to work.
Then what are you getting so upset about?
Its got nothing to do with marriage if thats what youre getting at.
Mom  For the last fucking time Im telling you Laura didnt want to get married  She is not that kind of girl  To use a phrase.  Thats not what happens now.
Its the best collection Ive ever seen.
Sixty.
Nice.
Dr. Kidell had a picture in his file of the funeral.  The father looked just like Richard.  Even had a mark on his cheek.
Yeah.
Ive been trying to find somebody who knew him and any connections his family might have had with museums or historical societies.
The boy died?
You owe me.  Besides Im cute.
Youll be safe here.  He wont kill in a church.
That bothers you?
You are being foolish.
Richard Taupin has become cumbersome.  It would be best if he just disappeared.
The only real difficulty comes in changing over the ownership of property Ive aquired.  That requires certain records and most importantly a personal appearance at the county seat in Gettysburg.  But thats where you come in.
Follow me.
At least.
A factor of age.
I see.
That would be difficult to explain.
What could possibly be worth all this murder and distruction.
What about that family in 31?
Empty.  And fear.  Fear of those that would kill you and fear of those that would love you.  It can never last and in the end you always end up destroying both.
The inheritance.
Im just curious.
Now theres a new topic.
You better have a warrant.  Thats my notebook youve got no right to be sticking your fingers into it.
Never take up poker Detective.
You see that desk?  Your desk?  You see the crap piled up on it?
What are you doing man?
In nomine sanctus esperitu
Juan Cid Romirez.  Chief surveyor and alchemist.
I was nearly killed.
Yes.  Always.
What?
This is madness
No
This is monstrous.  Ill burn in hell for all eternity.
Thats mad.  Surely you dont take their word?
Far away.
Perhaps not.  You seem to have misplaced a private.  No doubt by now his head is stranger to his neck.
Finish yours?
You seem to understand a great deal.
If you wish to play games Major.
I had no choice.
Figure shes with him?
Think we should call the local P.D. out there first?
How many came?
We learned hed found the immigration notaries in Liverpool and traced them to New York.  Then he figured out the birth records in Church Hill...
Kahn?
Sit.
Head still secure to the neck.
What are you doing here?
Not tonight.  Tonight I have a drink with an old friend.
Ive had a few more concerns.
Youre wrong.
Are you here?
Should I care?
Yes.
No.
Thats none of your business.
I presume its a sword.
Your murder weapon?
A neighbor saw your car leave.
When may I expect the cleaners?

Thanks for coming to get us. Little brother almost scared us to death.

Thats not me. I didnt... Im not doing that.
Yeah well hes still here. I think him and Jerry are fast becoming buddies you know Jerry... yeah hes gotta see everything... yeah I know... thinks theres some unsolved mystery around every corner.
Sleeping.
Christ I hope this isnt more crappy folk art. Its so quaint... its so primal... its so crap.
Tell me about it.
Shhhhhh quiet.
Cant Tiny drive us to a phone?
Just in the wrong place at the wrong time.
I dont doubt that.
Please let us go we wont tell anybody.
You said it not me.

Enough with the stupid voices.
Negative. Shit we are so deep in the sticks we could walk for hours and find zero.
Doing what? Messy up your day? Well fuck lady there are some bigger issues at hand... than your fucking have a nice fucking day bumper sticker shit
Well Bill... hes a good guy hes been great help to me... a real blessing... I couldnt have asked for a better specimen. I mean you dont know what a dry spell Ive had total block...  ...total block... but Bill hes OK.
This cant be real this cant be real this cant be real.
My name is Lt. Wydell Id like to ask you a few questions.
What God damn how many?
Im sure theres more than that... fucking pigs always travel in packs...  ...here take this.
Wait I want to say goodbye.
No they couldnt somebody had to see something.
Right.
Thats it?
How old do you think I am? I know who the fuck Spiderman is. Get to your point.
Uh...  We must never act like apes son. For you see The ape is our closest biological relative  specifically the pygmy chimp.  A single chromosome separates us. But you know what truly separates us from the apes what makes us better than apes?
And think about what youve done.
Like father like son.
Woof.
French?
Maybe we should just sit for a while. Its very peaceful.
Really? No. Not at all. Youre a very pretty girl. You should know that. You should be confident.
Its true. I wouldnt lie.
Nothing my darling. All is right with the world.
Shit.  Hi honey.
I dont know Nathan. What are you supposed to do?
Hmmph. Hmmph.  Nathan we have to talk you and I.
You have to choose Nathan. Its like Sophies choice. Only it is Nathans choice. Did you ever see that movie Sophies Choice? It is like that. Only it is this.
Unnhh.
Thats Lila?
I dont know. Somethings missing.
Talking is to be kept to a minimum. Eventually when we are ready there will be none. Language was invented so that people could lie to each other and to themselves. There is no other reason.
Then Ill live for both of us Lila. Ill be the most free truest animal in the whole forest. For both of us.
But first Ill live among them just long enough to testify before congress about the waywardness of humankind.
I love it Rose. Im getting to be a real girl.
Holy shit. Your brother didnt tell him about the nature of our relationship did he?
Three foot one.
Rose Nathans no midget but hes asked me to move in with him.
Shut up you.
Im really glad you two found each other.
Thank you so much. I love slugs. All slugs not just banana slugs.
Im not sure we can escape our natures. Believe me Ive tried. Im not even so sure anymore that we should want to.
Paper or cloth?
Im not sure.
Its only that I really enjoy your company and...
I like you too Nathan.
A deer?

Yes.
Yeah well Im sorry. The human heart is a strange thing.
Ooka.

Ive worked with embedded loading. Theyre communicating with a hidden signal. Theyre going to attack...
Connie dont hang up.
Fifty six minutes forty five seconds.
David dont...
Punched the President? Oh my god.
I could have evacuated the cities hours ago.  You know when I flew in the Gulf War everything is simple. We knew what we had to do. Its not simple anymore Connie. A lot of people died today. How many didnt have to?
Think. Its like in chess. First you strategically position your pieces. Then when the timings right. You strike.
Cant this thing go any faster?
Dad...
Because last time I saw him I punched him in the face.
He wasnt the President then.
Whatd I say?
Doesnt matter. Games over.
She should be shortly.
Yes Sir.
And our troops here?
Thats not your call to make Mr. Nimziki.
Sir I strongly recommend we move you to a secured location immediately.

I didnt take it. I thought I didnt need it anymore.
Just what the hell do you think youre doing?
Youre not going anywhere. You hear me? Im still your father.
For once in your life think about whats best for Troy. Who has to beg for money to buy him medicine when you screw up? Who?
Just fell asleep. Hes gonna be just fine. Join me in a little celebration?
Deploy.
The other bombers might have more luck. We shouldnt just give up...
Die.
Oh yes of course. But where are we going?
All your life.
Yes. My treat.
Dad was onto something here
Your father would know. Your father did know. Look. He made a map.
Arghhh Oh
No Henry. Try not to talk.
Dont take that tone with me my good man. Now buttle off and tell Baron Brunwald that Lord Clarence MacDonald and his lovely assistant are here to view the tapestries.
I know who you are Mr. Donovan. Your contributions to the museum over the years have been extremely generous. Some of the pieces in your collection here are very impressive.
The Holy Grail Doctor Jones. The chalice used by Christ during the Last Supper. The cup that caught His blood at the Crucifixion and was entrusted to Joseph of Arimathaea.
Every mans dream.  Including your fathers I believe.
Youve got the wrong Jones Mister Donovan. Why dont you try my father?
As what? A Nazi stooge like you?
Were through
I usually dont.
In that case I permit you.
But Im already sad  by tomorrow it will have faded.
Right. Six hundred years before the Crusades.
Oh yes. Give them a flower and theyll follow you anywhere.
Its lucky I dont do things the same way. Youd still be standing at the Venice pier.
So it did.
Then wait  count to twenty.
Dont worry  Im fine.
Good point.
He was actually there? You saw him?
And his shield... the inscription on Sir Richards shield...?
Alexandretta... of course... on the pilgrim trail from the Eastern Empire. Oh Junior...

You dont need the Diary Dad. Marcus has the map.
What final challenge?
Booby traps?
What about Marcus?
Two selfless martyrs. Jesus Christ
What you taught me was that I was less important to you than people who had been dead for five hundred years in another country. And I learned it so well that weve hardly spoken for twenty years.
I dont know. Well find out.
Fly... yes. Land... no.
More or less.  Son Im sorry. They got us.

The penitent man will pass. The penitent... the penitent. The penitent man...
J.
I can get it  I can almost reach it Dad.
After you Junior.
What happened to Marcus Sallah?
Compensation for my brotherinlaws car. Indy your father and Brody 
This is a different situation Dr. Jones. These people are like children. We have to lead them slowly into the twentieth century.
Something magical. A sacred rock.
Even if they were trying to scare us away a devout Hindu would never touch meat.  Makes you wonder what these people are...
Miss Scott panicked?
Did you discover anything in that tunnel Dr. Jones?
Finally
No  you cant go Something awfuls happened. Theyve got Short Round and I think Indys been 
We found a tunnel that leads to a temple below the palace Please come with me Ill show you
Its some kind of cult And theyve got the sacred stones that Indy was searching for.
His Highness has not yet taken a wife.
Dr. Jones we are all vulnerable to vicious rumors. I seem to remember that in Honduras you were accused of being a grave robber rather than a scientist.
Kali Ma protects us now and for ever and we must pledge our devotion by worshipping her with an offering of flesh and blood
Sure I found him. Then last night I had a little trouble. Somebody tried to slit my throat.
A bonus Dr. Jones. That is poison. You just drank the rest of it.
Thats it. Pankot Palace.
Why?
Behind you
Youre betrayed Shiva. 
Pankot isnt on the way to Delhi.
Nobody brought us here. Our plane crashed. We were shot down by 
Siam.
Since I was nice enough to let you tag along why dont you give your mouth a rest? Okay doll?
What?
THE WHAT?
Well when my nightclub career was run over by the Depression some pinhead convinced me that a girl could go places in the Orient... So look where I got.

Follow her.
Thats not funny.
You think. Thats what youre good at.
Never mind just say it.
Probably.
And Dieter?
Losing power. The laser drained it.
Whereve you been?
Rene?
Face it were the men for the job. Besides if someone is really chasing you the best way to avoid them is to keep moving ...and FIND THE GODDAMN PEM.
Oh I cant.
I know we fight but I dont mean it. Youre quite a guy. No one else could have dealt with this.
Trouble...is if we both get stuck here.
Well let you go. You leave the pods and the PEM.
Its the least we can do. After all its our responsibility.
I have a new client.

Well what do you think Im going to do? Quit in protest? Im not going to do that.
End up in a highprofile lawsuit with Lowell the First Amendment martyr? I dont think so.  Take a look at this... This is a summary of a dossier thats being prepared.
No. I should have. I told them I disagreed with you Mike and Kluster that this segment is as good as the original. Im not lying for you. Im not gonna shut up for you. Not on any of it.

Thats right.
Youre not making any mistake believe you me.
Say look I didnt know it was anything like this seeand
I wont say anything. Honest I wont.
My instinct is that Ferrie is going to keep on deteriorating and well end up getting more out of him when he finally cracks.  If we call him now he might freeze up and we could lose the best shot weve ever had.
Ive seen him copying files leaving here late at night.
Because you keep conning me Dean. I read your testimony to the Warren Commission and...
You tell them the day after the assassination you were called on the phone by this Clay Bertrand and asked to fly to Dallas and be Lee Oswalds layer.
You cant ever say crime dont pay in Louisiana Jim  only not as good as it used to.  Good chowder aint it?
Like I told to the Washington boys Bertrand called that summer and asked me to help the kid upgrade his Marine discharge...
I dont know how they got to me. Maybe cause I repped him here.  The Feebees run background checks.  On my mamas breasts man thats all I got.  There wasnt no conspiracy Jim.  If there were why the hell didnt Bobby Kennedy prosecute it as Attorney General he was his brother for Chrissake.  How the fuck three people could keep a secret like that I dont know.  It was Oswald.  He was a nut job.  Faggot yknow hated this country.
Gods sake chief.  The President was shot.
Susie youre an assistant D.A. remember.  Stick to what you can prove in court.
Hey where yat Frank?  Youre wasting your time here.  Big Jim gave strict orders.  No FBI allowed.
Boss would fry me in hog fat if he knew... 
No Im not...
Pretty flowery for Dave Ferrie.
Who is he Joe?  Ive been to every bar no one wants to talk.
Clay Bertrand is Clay Shaw?  The guy who used to run the International Trade Mart?
Yeah.  Clay.  I met him sometime in June of 62 at the Masquerade Bar. Dave Ferrie took me there for the express reason to meet him.
To frame him obviously.  You got to get in your minds how the hell spooks think Bill  Theyre not ordinary crooks.
Lets start making some assumptions about the man.  Why would he leave a path as big as Lee Harvey Oswalds? This is not a thin trail gentlemen it is a very wide one.  Who found the evidence?  Who set him up?  Lou Bill Susie I want you to go back and check all the sightings of Oswald in Dallas New Orleans and Mexico in the summer and fall of 63  see if its the same guy.
Hed die pretty quick either a heart storm or a ruptured blood vessel in the brain.
No I did not.
Dave you know thats where this road leads.
Yeah  Hed kill for you Dave.  He likes you.  Your mind.
Do you remember me Mr. Garrison?  I met you on Carondolet Street right after your election.  I congratulated you remember?
I see.  And where did you drive?
I see.  Dave thank you for your time.  Im sorry it has to end inconveniently for you but Im going to have you detained for further questioning by the FBI.
Dave I find your story simply not believable.
Oh you got that?  Banisters pet project.  Getting paid by the government to work against the government.  Beautiful.  What a mind he had what a guy Guy.  He had all those files.
Fuckin A.  How do you think the Agency gets people to do their bullshit?  Fuck knows what they got on Oswald
Shaws an untouchable man  highest clearance.  Shaw Oswald the Cubans  all Agency.
Jack?  Jack was a pimp.  A bagman in Dallas for the Mob.  He used to run guns to Castro when he was still on our side.  Check out Jack Youngblood. Shit  we almost had Castro.  Then we tried to whack him.  Everybodys flipping sides all the time.  Its fun n games man fun n games.
But you took his orders.  He was directing the autopsy.
Well I am saying it.  Bring in the jury.
Thats something Jasper.  What is it?
I knew something was crooked as a dogs hind leg cause no one who is just taking a deposition gets that involved and angry... sure enough when I finally read my testimony as published by the Warren Commission it was a fabrication from start to finish.
Negative on his tax records. Classified.  First time I know a D.A. cant get a tax record.  I put together a list of all the CIA files on Oswald that were part of the Warren Report and asked for them.  There are about 1200 documents...  Oswald in the USSR in Mexico City Oswald and the U2 a CIA 201 personnel file a memo from the Director on Oswald travel and activities  cant get one of them.  All classified as secret on the grounds of national security.  Its real strange.
Makes sense  hes a spokesman.
The FBI finally gets around to talking to him in Dallas and runs a file on him as a miscreant Communist type.
And Marina?  Does she have a problem getting out?
Sort of like Benedict Arnold coming back to George Washingtons cabinet.
I wonder about the Williams.  Just where did the first description of Oswald come from at 1244?  No one knows.  They claimed it was Brennans but his description came after 1 P.M.  Who called?  Somehow the FBIs been tapping the Williams and picks up a call between Bell Helicopter and Janets phone an unidentified voice saying We both know whos responsible.  Who called?  Whys the Bureau been tapping them?
Bugging the District Attorneys office of New Orleans  Its outrageous
This is interesting  are you ready for this?  Oswald went to see the FBI two weeks before the assassination.  It seems Special Agent Hosty made three routine visits to his house supposedly to keep an eye on Marina Oswald.
Well... in an investigation were conducting your name has come up a number of times.
Not at all.  But on the other hand I do have a lovely Chippendale dining table and I often have a friend over sitting at one end while I sit at the other.  That is precisely the point of a long dining table.  The splendor of the meal adds to the enjoyment of it.
It adds a taste of elegance for which I must confess a weakness for now and then.  I call him Smedley.  His real name is Frankie Jenkins  but I could hardly imagine anything more uncouth during dinner than my turning toward the kitchen and hollering Frankie .. Where is this leading to Mr. Garrison?
Pffft  Absolute nonsense.  The Quarter is filled with vivid imaginations my dear Mr. Garrison  grimy young hoodlums wholl say and do anything.  As you well know.
One meets so many attorneys in my business.  No I dont believe I know Dean Andrews.
Naturally.  Are you claiming Mr. Garrison that Mr. Oswald also had dinner with me?
Mmmmm... sure smells good... but Egghead do you realize Oswald was interrogated for twelve hours after the assassination with no lawyer present and nobody recorded a word of it?  I cant believe it.  A police captain with 30 years experience and a crowd of Federal agents just had to know that with no record anything that Oswald said would be inadmissible in court.
Its incredible honey  the whole thing.  A Lieutenant Colonel testifies that Lee Oswald was given a Russian language exam as part of his Marine training only a few months before he defects to the Soviet Union.  A Russian exam
But why in the Lords name would you do it in the middle of Easter Sunday when you knew we were...
Liz Im really sorry.  The meeting went much longer than expected.
Leave us ALONE for Gods sake  ...Oh its Lou.
Our home Jim  A kidnapper a murderer who knows
How do you know?  How do you even know what goes on in this house anymore  Youre too busy making speeches stirring up every crazed Klansman in Louisiana after us
Im leaving.  Im taking the kids and Im leaving  I wont stand it anymore.
You and your government  Whats the matter with you?  Dont you have any feelings?  Your daughter  What kind of man are you?
I never doubted for a second that I was.  Will you come to the trial Elizabeth?
Oh no  No  I cant believe it.  I cant believe it.  Both of them both brothers oh my God
Bring on all the motherfuckers Bring their college degrees in here I got nuthin to hide.  They cant buy me.  You cant buy me.  I dont even need the parole.  This is about the truth coming out.  Youre a goddamn liberal Mr. Garrison you dont know shit cause you never been fucked in the ass.  Fascism is here now Facism is...
You wanna know why?  Cause that mother fucker Kennedy stole that fuckin election thats why  Nixon was gonna be one of the great Presidents til Kennedy wrecked this fuckin country.  Got niggers all over the fuckin place asking for their rights where do you think we got all this fuckin crime now cause Kennedy promised em too damned much. Revolution comin.  Fascisms coming back.  I tell ya this  the day that Communist sumbitch died was a great day for this country.  I jes hate to think theyre blaming it on some silly fuckin Oswald who didnt know shit anyway.  People should know why that sumbitch was killed.  Cause he was a Communist.  Put me on the stand go ahead Ill tell the same goddamn story Im proud of it dont matter fuck all to me things dont change.
Yeah Guy Banister.  ExFBI man.  He died couple years ago.
What are you driving at boss?
I have a plane to catch... going to Washington.  An interesting lead says hes closely connected to these events but he wont come down here... I know what youre going through with Ferrie Lou.  Well talk tomorrow.
Id say the opposite  hypertension.
Who?
Allen Dulles?
Russell honestly you sound like one of those kooky critics spreading paranoia like prairie fire.  I just cant believe the Chief Justice of the United States would put his name on something that wasnt true.
Ive been called everything under the sun Jerry.  Call me whatever you like.
Your faith in the veracity of the major media is touching Jerry.  It indicates that the Age of Innocence is not yet over.  But seriously Jerry people arent interested in Jim Garrison  they want the hard evidence  They want to know why he was killed and what forces were opposed to...
Sure they do.  The camera can pick this up.
Yes.
Well I just hope it was worth my while Mr...
Ive already been warned by the Agency Mr. Whoever.  If this is another type of threat I dont...
No chance in hell Mr. Garrison. Id be arrested and gagged declared insane and hospitalized... maybe worse.  You too.  I can only give you background you got to find the foreground the little things... Keep digging.  Yknow youre the only person to ever bring a trial in the murder of John Kennedy.  Thats important  its historic.
But you dont have a choice anymore. Youve become a significant threat to the national security structure. They wouldve killed you already but you got a lot of light on you. Instead theyre gonna destroy your credibility they already have in many circles in this town.  Youre some kinda egocrazed southern caricature to many folks.  Be honest  the best chance you got is come up with a case something anything make arrests stir the shitstorm. You gotta hope to reach a point of critical mass where other people will come forward and the government will crack.  Remember fundamentally people are suckers for the truth and the truth is on your side bubba. I hope you get a break...
His name?
Never touched me.
I dont know if I should talk about this.
Was he there often?
There was one guy I dont know big guy business guy white hair  I saw him come into the office once. He looked out of place yknow  like a society guy.  Cant remember his name.  Oswald was with him.
Its a contradiction Numa get used to them.  The only explanation for the royal treatment is he did give them radar secrets.  Or fake secrets.
Hell never make it.  If he wins theyll kill him.  He wants to avenge his brother.  Hell stop that war. No theyll kill him before they let him become President.
Yes thank you Mr. Garrison.  Your coffees almost Turkish down here but I could get used to it.
I imagine because this is the Criminal District Court Building  This is an enlargement of a potential shooter standing behind the picket fence.  We...
If you must know virtually nothing.
The job manages to keep me pretty busy.
How long do you think it would take me to be appointed?
Yes.
Who was there for your ass?
Look I hate to be the kinda nigga does a nigga a favor  then BAM  hits a nigga up for a favor in return. But Im afraid I gotta be that kinda nigga.
Course you didnt.
Can she afford a good one is the question. Otherwise shell be in Sybill Brand three weeks easy before the Public Defender gets around to her.
Hey Jackie.
She wants to go back to work.
What time do you have to be there?
Sure ever been to the Riverbottom?
Its okay. Its a cop hangout.
You know I figured out the other day Ive written something like fifteen thousand bonds since Ive been in the business. Id say about eighty percent of them were at least drug related. If you want I can help you look at your options.
It was the other guy who busted me.
Give em what you got. Offer to help. Show a willingness to be helpful. You want to stay out of jail dont you?
You went out this morning and bought a gun?
You went out this morning and bought a gun.
Sure.
What I meant was have a lawyer do the negotiating for you.
No thanks. Theres gotta be other ways to get it out.
Surprise.
I know ignoring me. Whatre you up to?
How was it?
They seem to like the idea.
You dont propose something like that unless youre pretty sure the other persons into it.
Okay sure. I might be tempted. Especially now since Im getting out of the bail bonds business.
Shoot him with the stun gun. While hes incapacitated cuff him take em to County.
He never came home. But Im sitting on the couch in the dark holding my stun gun and the whole house smells of mildew  So after a couple hours I think What am I doing here? Nineteen years of this shit? So I made up my mind thats it.
All Winston had to do was ask around. Ordells living in Long Beach with a woman junkie.
People talk to Winston. Hes street same as them they trust him. They get busted they know somebody who can bond them out. I thought I might drop in on him. Hell no doubt be surprised to see me.
Im sure.
Youll get over that.
Im just tired in general.
And cooperate? You might get probation.
Do you live together?
Not every day?
He told me. Besides why else would an A.T.F. man be after him?
Short of wearing a wire Ill do everything I can to help you throw his ass in jail. And in exchange for my help I need permission to leave the country and immunity.
You two meet?
Ever meet her or they talk about her?
Whos the other one?
She told you that?
Was she there?
But she mentioned Beaumont by name?
Oh thats taken care of. I called the State Attorneys Office. You were nofiled this morning in Circuit Court.
I went looking for you. I went straight to the bookstore cause thats where you were last time but you werent there. How the hell else am I supposed to let anybody know what happened? You didnt tell me how to do that did you? I knew I was under surveillance so when I couldnt spot anybody I started yelling.
I thought you were watching him.
Gimme one anyway.
I told them.
I suppose you see a piece of this for yourself?
I can do that.
What the hell you talkin bout?
Well you werent supposed to be there.
She wont have no problems cause she dont know nothin.
She dont know shit about the money.
Were partners Baby sorta. I aint gonna screw you. You havent told me where I put it for you.
Uhhuh.
We had done time together already.
I dont like dancing.
Now thats over lets get to know each other.
I wouldnt go so far as to say that.
Does that bother you?
Uhhuh?
And your point is?
Uhhuh?
All right already.
Just stay right fuckin here all right?
Whats your cost?
Cmon in.
Over halfmillion dollars worth of merchandise.
What does that mean?
Hang it up shes on her way. You gotta listen to this. This involves you.
Did you get it?
When I see you. Pick me up at Sams. You count the money?
Thats what I gotta tell you. She bugged me the whole time. Got pissy with me cause I wouldnt let her carry the bag. Started running her fuckin mouth... I couldnt remember right away when we came out where the car was parked so she got on me about that. Is it this aisle Lou is is it that one? She was totally fuckin with my nerves.
Twice. In the parking lot.
In the chest and stomach.
We went to the parking lot.
Maybe the Feds got it.
Tell me.
Sure thing. I dont have to know what Im doing long as you know.
Hes a big one. You two tight?
It was our idea to take the picture wasnt it?
Fella named Beaumont. They have him up at county. It started out drunk driving but they wrote it up possession of a concealed weapon. Dumb monkeyass had a pistol on him.
You think you could do that?
The door was opened so I just came right in.
She had I believe it was... fifty grand on her too. There was a cop at the hearing. Young guy with L.A.P.D. wanted her bond set at twenty five thousand saying there was a risk of flight. Jackie being a stewardess and all.
Did the police contact you?
What does she do for you?
Cause you want me to know what a slick guy you are. You got stewardesses bringing you fifty grand.
She got off huh?
Git your ass in here.
Ola
I was gonna tell you...
Just to see you. Thats all.
No dont. But thanks.
Stop
I dont know if I can. Its just that war is war. Things happen.
Theres nothing to expose.
Maybe its not the army Jake.
Dont bother to call again okay?
This isnt injustice Mr. Geary. The army did something to us and weve got to find out what.
Exactly. And we need someone to cut through it. We hear youre the man.
Ah Well then theyre going to have to pay for that arent they?
You need ... a doctor.
Somethings going on here. Youre not telling me something. What the hells gotten into you?

He told me he was going to Hell.

No. Home here.
You going to be all right?
All Im saying is that Amity is a summer town  we need summer dollars and if they cant swim here theyll use the beaches at Cape Cod or Long Island.
Thats good. Thats real good. Ben Meadows getting pictures for the paper.
Be reasonable boys  this isnt the time or the place to do some kind of halfassed autopsy on a fish. Ben...  do you have all the pictures you need?
Why?
Maybe we can save August...
Youre tellin me. I swear this town has gone crazy.
Who are you?
Swell.
Just as I thought. He drifted up here with the Gulf Stream from southern waters.
I Bought it.  Both sets of grandparents set up trust funds for me stocks went up so I dont have to touch my principal.
It is a job. Im not fooling around like some amateur. Its my life
I want to check something. Hold my feet.
Youre situation here suggests that a Great White has staked out a claim in the waters around Amity Island and that he will continue to feed here as long as there is food in the water.
I wish it would rain...
This is quite a place.
Just keep kicking.
Somebody couldve  I was sort of passed out.
We never had any. Whats the problem?
I wouldnt put it that way. But I love sharks.

Lets just cut him open and see whats inside...
So thats cool with you then?
Im real sorry I had sex with you. I know it wasnt your idea.
I asked my dad and Bren not to narc us out to your folks so we should be safe.
What about Katrina De Voort? You could go out with Katrina De Voort.
You know Ive been thinking. Im really sorry I was such a huge bitch to you. You didnt deserve that. You never deserve any of the poo I unload on you.
No youre naturally smart. You always think of the funniest things to do. Remember when you passed me that postcard during Spanish class and it was addressed like Junebug MacGuff Row 4 Third Seat From the Blackboard? And it said Im having fun in Barcelona  wish you were here? That was hilarious.
You are always trying to keep it real. Im in love with how you feel. I dont see what anyone can see in anyone else but you.
Oh hey Vijay.
Yup.
What are you talking about?
I think kids get bored and have intercourse. And I think Junebug was a dummy about it. But we have to move on from here and help her figure it out.
Youre not going to be a PopPop. And Junos not going to be a ma. Somebody else is going to find a precious blessing from Jesus in this garbage dump of a situation. I friggin hope.
Oh God yeah. But I was hoping she was expelled or into hard drugs.
Well youre a brave young lady. Youre made of stronger stuff than I thought. Youre a little Viking
I drove to St. Cloud to show Mark and Vanessa the ultrasound. And I wound up staying for a couple of hours.
They said they wanted to know about this stuff. They said to keep them updated so I did
I dont know I just did. And while we were waiting for Vanessa Mark and I watched The Wizard of Gore and he burned me some CDs of weird music. Hes kind of cool.
Well honey doctors are sadists who like to play God and watch lesser people scream.
Fine. Call me when you learn how to love just one person and not cheat at your brothers college just because you had four Smirnoff Ices and a bottle of Snow Peak Peach flavored Boones
Geeeerta Rauuuss
Well I just have the baby and give it to you right?
What? No Do we come off like paranoid yuppies or something?
Ive got something really cool to show you guys. Is Vanessa here?
Commercials.
Have you seen those ads for Titanium Power mens deodorant?
I wrote that.
Hey I like this.
Well sort of. Vanessa likes Madison for a girl.
Youre something else.
I came over as soon as I got that cold ultrasound goo off my pelvis. My stepmom verbally abused the ultrasound tech so we were escorted off the premises.
You should have gone to China. I heard they give away babies like free iPods. They shoot em out of those Tshirt guns at sports events.
Come on I have something for you.
I dont know. I just liked being your friend. I sort of liked becoming furniture in your weird life.
Yeah but didnt you love Vanessa when you married her? If you love someone once you can love them again I know it. My friend Leah has gone out with the same guy like four times. Youre just not trying.
No thanks. Im off pills.
Yeah apparently. Im having it on May 4.
I thought people got all that stuff at baby showers. When my stepmom had my sister I remember she got about a million presents. They were all lame though so I wasnt jealous.
Nothing.
Im not crying. Im allergic to fine home furnishings. See you later.
Congrats.
My dad used to be in the Army but now hes just your average HVAC specialist. He and my mom got divorced when I was five. She lives on a Havasu reservation in Arizona...
Youre pregnant?

Jesus I didnt say it was.
I am a suicide risk.
I know. Women Now I guess. The commercial says they help women now.
Eh Ill call them myself. But I do need your help with something very urgent.
Nah it was a premeditated act. The sex I mean not getting pregnant.
No I heard you. I just cant give the baby to people who describe themselves as wholesome. Im looking for something a little edgier.
Almost eight. You wouldnt believe how weird I look naked.
Trust me you dont. I actually have to wear a bra now. And I have to rub this nasty cocoa butter stuff all over myself or my skin could get stretched too far and explode.

A bad day You wanna hear a bad day? Yesterday my son was smashed over by a car and when my wife found out she collapsed on the floor. She had a minor heart attack. Partial paralysis. But I dont let myself get sad. No way. Not me. Its not good for the soul.
No.
What if you cant make yourself happy? What if everything falls apart?
Yeah. I was gonna write a book but I cant spell.
And you feel like youre being ripped open inside.
I know.
Foreplay. Foreplay.
Yeah. And then it hits that little thing.  That little punch bag. What is it? The tonsils. The esophagus whatever.
Good luck.
I only did it once and...
Dont go anywhere. Stay with me.
No. I just gotta go find him.
Yeah. It depends. Cause like this one time with Eric when we got blasted at his house. And Smash J and DJ Flipper was there...
And we were blasted and he must have been dumb horney. And he just pulled me over to the bed. And they were in the room like getting dressed like getting ready to go to go to Disco
Yeah I get bored.
Did they ask you a lot of questions?
Its not his fault. He had a hard life.
Youve heard the stories right?
Oh god. Thats horrible.
Fourthirty in the morning?
If I had it maybe. But right now I dont have a penny to my name.
Its me. Telly.
Paul its Telly. Open up.
Nothing. We just wanted to come by and see what you were up to.
That shit is nothin. I remember I had just turned 14. With this fuckin asshole who was like 18. I dont even remember his name. I think it was John or Jake or something. I remember he had a brother named Lentil because I would always joke and call him Lentil Bean. This was away at like sleep away camp with your friends and shit.
Its grandmother style.
And we were like underneath the sheets. We were going at it like crazy. Oh my God that shit was so good It was like hard...
To come?
Yes.
What kind of problem?
You are  I dont like you.
It means if I were a killer and I thought the police were closing in on me I might invent someone to try and put them off the scent.
What?
Lets see how much he wants to play.
You think youre going to catch him on a trace?  Everything he does is planned out well in advance.  The only way were going to get him is to rattle him  make him slip up.
You dont have an investigation without me.  You got that?
No I need the original note.
I was at the beach.
Im positive.
Run it down.
Im sorry this is just too convenient.
Could someone this disturbed give the appearance of being normal?
Ive got a feeling were going to go the distance with him.  Let him sweat for a little while.
I dont know.  Maybe theres two of them.  Maybe he hired some Wino to make the calls.
Who is this?
I havent got time for this.
We all have paths to follow.  You hope yours will lead you to me.
Do you know what Im doing right now Peter?  Im looking at the name of the girl Im going to kill tonight.
I know what I said  She looks just like...
Please I dont want to get into the psychological aspects of my actions. It would detract from the game.
If its so important why dont you just tell me?
Very good.
Youre groping.  I have been fair. Its my move now.
Dont beg Peter.  She has to die.  I cant win unless she dies.
No  Wait
Can we correlate data?  Look for specific things like players ages... stuff like that?
Have computer search for anyone thats used that opening against me.  There cant be more than a handful.
New York.  1986.  Viktor Yurilivich.
You could have been honest with me for starters.  We work together.  I have to be able to trust you.
Fuck off
How come the police never had a record of Sanderson before.  This doesnt come out of nowhere there has to be a history.
Youre losing me.
Uh huh.
Of course.
For what?
Six eight hours tops.
Not that I can see.  Well know more once I get the lab reports back from Seattle.
Not much.  I dont think she was raped. Theres no bruising or any signs of trauma to the pelvic region  and no trace of sperm which makes sense because she took a bath.
No prints.
No Frank.  No prints.
Yeah.
About a quarter to one.
Were going to work on the message.
Here.  I played Gregory Lutz.
To my room and then I went for a walk.
Thats alright.  Well take it from here.
How can he be playing Chess with you? Youre not making any moves against him.
Wait a minute.  Theres an apartment in that area called the Castle Arms.
Are we going to go through this again?
On a variation yes  but it must be a variation that is unique.
Our computer went on the fritz again. David came up to fix it.
Hi Sara.  This is Doctor Sheppard.  I was wondering if you could tell me if you have a book on chess called Principals and Tactics by Anton Berger.
What are they please?
Yes.
How come you dont stay with them?
Not really.  You see your goal and you go after it.  Anything that gets in the way is an obstacle and must be destroyed.
Chess is a reflection of life.  Life is violent.  The strong win.  The weak perish.
If youre asking me if Im passionate about what I do the answer is yes. Without passion nothing moves us. Whats your passion?
I see.  This is going to be a very polite conversation.  What shall we discuss?  The weather?  Movies?
Each circumstance requires a different tactic.
Getting too hot in here for you?
Did you think it was going to be easy? You think he was going to lay it out at your feet?
I dont think I could.
Another kind of game?
I think its best if we dont ask too many personal questions  I want to keep things on a professional level.
Why?
I dunno.  Wheres Erica mother?
And you?
Im just trying to get to know you Peter.
What are you talking about?  You dont even know me.
Then show me who you are.
I cant think any more unless its about you.  Ill be in the middle of a match and instead of thinking about my next move I think about how you look when you smile.  Remember how you said that I hide behind my chessboard?  Ever since my wife died Ive been...  Ive been afraid of getting too close to someone again  afraid of losing them.
You dont understand.
Why not?
Well you should be because this time Im going to win.
Maybe youd better look around for another candidate. I dont think my skin is tough enough to survive a lifetime of you and your brush.
In a great fortress in the mountains. Wait. Somethings happening.
You must move away from the Center.
It was a platonic kiss Father.
You cant reach her  Through the door.  Quickly
Does the Queen live?
Turolds son was to marry her.
I have no extraordinary powers.
Two or three days While Lyssa is in their hands?
But there is another entrance to this place.
Then even if Lyssa tells us where she is well never be able to reach her for they will never allow the Fortress to rise near us.
Yes. They will be more help than highborn barons.
Yes they knew of your first contact so they drove her below.
The deeper she goes the harder it is to contact her. Once she is below the second level you will not be able to reach her at all.
He sees betrayal everywhere. He will attack us so long as he is conscious.
I chose the wrong passage.
Use your sword.
Cut. uCutu
I forbid you
I found the body of the Seer in the stream.
Yes. It is today.
Each to his fate.
Perhaps you think no man would return to me.
Yes.
You will not then?
I doubt it. The water is only an inch deep.
A forest near the Valley of Needles.
What business?
Hah You dont know me boy.
Why do they burn the villages? Theres nothing to gain.
These well pay for.
Those beasts cannot be saddled by mortal men.
The Swamp of Betrayal. Be glad we dont have to cross it.
First you desert me and now you mock me. Go back to your oneeyed friend.
Would you desert your friends?
You had better manners as a pig.
The greatest boon of your otherwise worthless life blockhead is the privilege of dining on boar roasted by the hand of Ergo the Magnificent.
You know nothing of power you foolish girl. You think power is a mighty sword or a strong castle or the paltry magic of an Emerald Seer. Power is none of these.
It has been taken Freylag and all his people slaughtered.
Modred has treated with the Dark Ones.
It is important to assure the succession.
They will have the life that you and I might have had.
How many did you lose?
She has the power to kill.
Its a hundred leagues from here.
That is true.
No she was not as beautiful.
We had no children.
Yes.
Power you have given me. What can my power give you?
Of what?
Why must you know?
Tomorrow the Fortress of Krull will rise with the sun in the Valley of Reeds. But the knowledge is of no use to you. No man has ever escaped the Web. And soon the creature will come for you even here.
You cannot stop time. Go now before it runs out.
Why do you want to know?
OK. Mister Stansfield Norman STANSFIELD.
Yeah... How do you know it?
No?
No... Not yet.  Hes very shy... and very sensitive.
...Not at all.
Good.
Yeah...  Come on have a little training.

Yes.
Quick doesnt mean ready. And you cant discuss we said. Right?
No.
No you cant go out.
OK... And if its you who gets killed?  ...Then?  Talking about other peoples death is easy but what about yours? Shes here She moves around you and can get you in a thousandth of second. Because it was your day your hour your second...
And... May I kiss you like in the movies may this be an exception?
Mathilda dont resume please. ....Change subject OK?
What shall we do?
Friends? Youre crazy  In my building before they just cared drugs all day and you couldnt get one or they just cared video games and you couldnt get one no more.
...Youre young Mathilda... You still have a chance to get out.  You cant give up this chance. You have to protect it. Theres a lot of things to do in life a lot of other jobs...
Huh really? What? Come on Im waiting
Well... I proposed them to play roulette...  Like we played...  ...And I lost.
...Mathilda I dont feel like talking about this.
Stop Mathilda Dont talk like that
...Yes. The day he got out of jail. I allowed him to make ten steps... No more. And bang. Two hundred meters. By telescope. That night I left my country and came here to join my father who worked for Tony.  ...I was 17. Then I never left the city...  And never had another girlfriend...
...Yes.
Yeah what?
Good Snipers cant be in position.
Its not me its dark here... and I cant find the switch.
I have no fear.
Huh? Why?
Messina.
Giancarlo... Rinaldi.
No...
Youre right son. You must care the links with your family always.  Its the only important thing in the world.
Salute.
I respect your business Mister Tony. Every time we asked your help we were very happy with the result.  Its right this that makes me nervous now.  I hope youll excuse my temporary bad mood?
...Even his mother wouldnt.
May we have this wolfs name and address?
Where?
Why am I such an authority?
No its not.
How serious is it?
I wont let you die.
Thats enough.
Okay.
Its just a regular day.
We can do it together.
Sometimes people need to see things done for them  because sooner or later they dont believe the words anymore.
Show me.
You like to take walks?
Dont bring it in here  it probably has all kinds of diseases.
Where?
Im not proving to her.  Im showing her.  And I know I dont have to.  I want to.  Ive realized love is about giving. Im alive I can still give to her. I want to give her everything I can.
His name is Maurice.  Hes dancing around everything else.
If hes in trouble with the law  fine.  Not our problem.  He yanked two people from a car wreck lets give him some space.
This guys not a murderer.
Jumped where?
By car right?
Never have children.  If theyre not a burden to you theyre a burden to someone else.
I told you.
So Ive been informed.
Where am I?
Which hospital?  Did you take me back?
You ever lose somebody Stephanie?
Someone should be with you.
Fortyseven years.

No.
No.
Of course.
A shot of tequila if you can spare it.
No just drunk... but thats OK. Wheres your car?
I was looking for you tonight. I dont know if you have a boyfriend...
I like hearing you talk.  If you feel up to a short walk theres a place to eat around the corner. All the food in Vegas is terrible so the place doesnt really matter. How does that sound to you?
Sera... you know Im not much good in the sack.
Three nights two days. When is your rent coming up at the motel?
What I mean is that you should bring your stuff over here. Were spending all this time together... what the fuck
Lets face it Ben were having fun here. Ive never done so much talking in my life.
Dont be silly?
What?
I do. I really do.  OK. I have to do some shopping alone. You go out for a few drinks and then pick up your things. Dont hurry and Ill be back before you to let you in.
Seriously Ben... I need to keep pretty lowkey around here. Maybe next time you could nap this side of the door. That was the landlord.
OK.
Because... its better for me that way. OK?
Do you want to go gambling tonight? We could go out and play for a few hours.
Well then... I hope we dont run into any tonight.
We?
I warned you...  ...but Im sorry.
OK but remember that they wear it because they have to. I wear it because I want to. Thatll make me look different. Lets get a drink.
How much do you think?
Sorry. Look... you seem like a nice girl. Im just sick of everyone in this town trying to get my money.
I am lonely Yuri.
I once had to judge a Theta Chi Tighty Whitey contest. Trust me  I can handle anything.
I cant give you that. And if you put me on the stand Ill lie.
Thats not whats important.
Whatever it is  it could save you.
I know You helped me go from a six to a four
I guess.
Because they got wet.
Whos askin?
Due to the fact that you retained the residence Ms. Bonafante is entitled to full ownership of the canine property in question and we will be enforcing said ownership immediately.
No she was crying her eyes out.
Oh yes. Mrs. Windham is the most sweet wonderful woman I know. I have loved her since the day she hired me. She could never do something this awful. I know this because we are very close.
Just the love in my heart.
Would you be willing to stake your life on it?
Definitely I love him
Im so happy for you
Licensed attorney or family member?
You know her?
Although Mr. Huntington makes an excellent point I have to wonder if the defendant kept a thorough record of each sperm emission made throughout his life?
I know. He has it sent out.
You think?
Why else would he be taking you to The Ivy? Youve been dating for a year  its not like hes trying to impress you.
Serious? Who the hell does he think he is? Youre the most popular month on the USC calendar
Thank you. I love you too.
The professors? Yeah they tend to do that. Socratic method.
Thanks again for your help
Shes completely untrustworthy.
She married an old man shes made a living on telling women theyre too fat she hawks her crap on the Home Shopping Network...
Youre going to trust the word of a woman who named her child after a condiment? Shes lying.
Law school was a mistake. Getting this internship was a mistake.
Going back to LA. Maybe I can fulfill my destiny as a useless bimbo and join the Swedish Bikini Team. No more navy blue suits. No more panty hose. No more trying to be something Im not.
Oh my God
Are you asking me on a date?
Is he the only one?
What happened?
I changed my mind. Id pick the dangerous one.
She was a Delta Gamma Not in my pledge class or anything  she graduated five years ahead of me. But I used to take her class at the LA Sports Club. Shes amazing
Has Warner Huntington checked in yet?
I mean were having a lot of fun now  but things are gonna be different when Im at Harvard. Law school is a completely different world. I need to be serious.
Youre breaking up with me because Im too  blonde?
No.
Harvard. Law school.
I feel like weve barely spent any time together since we got here.
Am I on glue or did I not get into the same law school you did Warner?
Are you serious?
Why do you say that?
Nay.  This is a private affair no audience welcome... Better you watch the dismantling of our enemies... and look you see the moat is set aflame.
Delusion... a kind of magic which works against the magician.
Indeed the best of fun... Enjoy yourselves.
You lie  You wish to humiliate me as if the form Im forced to bear were not punishment enough
I know no more of shame than I do of fear.  I wear this mask not for concealment but protection.
I prefer a plump capon but will happily serve you rats if theyre to your liking.
Do it now
Pleasure is for those who seize it Do you think those insipid pale skinned mortals will ever know such rapture?
I said I mean no harm... I thought this as empty tomb.
Well er... no.  I mean you dont look like dragons Ive heard of.
Its terrible.
I need your help.  In order to fight Blackheart I must wear the armor of Achilles.  I 
Gump is it?
Im in no mood for dancing.
Please dont misunderstand.  I am grateful for your hospitality and 
Aye.  Black Barons mischief.
Time for a champion.  Can you do more than pick acorns and rob birds nests Jack?
I know where to find it.  Taking possession be another matter.
Whats left of me... How do I recognize the armor of Achilles?
Better we eat him than the other way round.
Somethings coming.
It would appear so.
Well... if the knight be already dead what harm is there in... borrowing a thing or two?
Something the matter?
Very secretive they are.  Keep their feet covered up.  Best if you dont mention it.
Stay on your guard Jack.  The bug is enchanted surely.
No thank the Lord but she be sore envenomed by the spiders bite.
The chill is worse this night.
Its your own fear troubles you... Were here arent we?  For all the dark magic protecting it.
Dont loose heart... Assemble the archers.  Have everyone not holding a shield man a bow.  Shoot the damned things as they fly.
Will you chance a miss?
I dont... understand.
In the dark lad?  Why should he do that?
Mean you to seek him out below?
I admire your valor Jack.  By all means seek him out... But first we needs visit the kitchen.
Dont get too far
Hush up Screwball.  Do your own wormsticking if you like the taste so well.
No no no... this is different
Screwball  Be quiet...  We have friends live neath the Needle. Theyll no doubt provide safe refuge for the night.
Theyve fired the moat
Rise Screwball and into the basket with you.
Oh Jack you are a wild man to use me so.
Only were he a fool to boot.  See yon viper?
Be patient.
Ill go search for it.
Your command is my wish Princess Lili.
It happened so fast.  He was hurt and ran away.
Jack... Green Jack you mustnt flatter me so.
Youve freed me Jack...
I cant have been under much more than a minute.
Pinching me
His feet shall never cross my lips.
I bring you the only treasure worthy of your loveliness... for naught else in the universe rivals the reflected glory of your beauty.
The sight of you makes flowers seem like dross.  All the heavenly angels must envy your grace.
Far as youre concerned shes dead believe it or not.
Pray you be sweet as your words dear Jack.
Be fair Oona.
I think shes about to foal.
Watch behind or Ill never collect on it
Havent heard a bird sing in days...
No speeches  Whats a little swim after sticking worms and ogres?
Oh but I have.
Im sending you back to Hell
To Castle Couer de Noir?
A castles but stone and mortar 
Home after.  Will you come in and say hi?
Mom said I should.
I dont think Dad wants you home.
What color?
And why was the alarm on?
Uh...using Josh like that.
No.
Im not shaving my legs or pits this summer Ive decided.
I need to ask you something Mr. Nelson.
He jumped into the ocean.
You look better without makeup.
Come over to my house whenever you want. Ill tell my mom.
Really?
No thanks.
Im sorry.  Im just here to shower.
Hand me a towel.  Im getting out.
Why are you so stupid?
Im not gay.
Okay.  I guess.
If my kids and my wife were always at an exhusbands house Id worry.
From Tuesday to yesterday not including Monday or today.  Okay...Mrs. Dokos is repeatedly running over her lawn.  The Corliss have attributed the increase in rat population in their environs to the state of your...structure.
He builds models for architects.  His dad on the other hand was the real deal.  Designed and built the coolest houses Ive ever seen.
He wants the entire roof taken off and lowered.
After your last extension request and with Design Review and the Board of Adjustment and the appeals to the city council was there an amended permit?
Maybe thats too long.
I hate this job.
Yes it is.
Thanks Id like that.  Thank you.
Thank you.
The plumbers due out on Friday.
Youll know me by the time were through.
You dont have a choice.
Id blame you.  I want you here.
Itll be fine.
Youll have money when you work for it.
Ill apologize for everything but today...Today I give a shit.
The game was to make me smaller than he was.  No matter what.  He could be almost invisible as a human being but I had to be smaller.  So if I got good grades I was a pussy for not playing football.  If I cut my hair for him it wasnt short enough.  If I shaved it I looked like a psycho.  I never won the game.  Not once. And if he couldnt make me smaller with words...
We havent build shit.  Youre just tearing down your father.
How do you become something youre not?
He was a prick when I was six and hes a prick today.
I havent used anything for two days. Im trying.
After everything he did to you and your mom?
Absolutely.  Have him put it on a separate line.  At Christmas well pact it so full of lights well make God wear sunglasses.
The kind where there isnt really an answer.
This was all for your sake wasnt it? Having me here?  Trying to get me to like you.
Good for you.
Id build a house.
A handshake or you know someone pats you on your back through clothes. Doctors people who have to touch you. But not by people who want to.
Check the permits.  It was built as a guesthouse.  Its a legally rentable unit grandfathered when South Laguna was incorporated.
I havent forced him to work.  I only wet him down once.  Why would he leave?
She needs to be alone I think.
Friday...God I hate the thought of him home all day.
Did you tell him he was spending the summer with me?
Lets go.
That wasnt a dream.  That was Sam.
Hindsight.  Its like foresight without a future.
No.  Why?  I like to be with Sam.
What did I say?
You bit my finger.
Left you?
What did he say?
Its not my back thats killing me.
Dont even...Im there.
Im thinking its too weird now.
I could use the money.
Is Lois still here?  Im starved.
Do you remember anything Ive said that wasnt negative?
So am I Robin.  Im working at something too.  Im even talking.  Do you want to be around for it?
What are you doing home?
I never asked for more.
Please dont leave me.
That was my plan...to be hardly recognizable to you as me.
Take it off.
Do you like red?
No.
Yeah.
Then maybe this isnt what he wants but this what he was hoping for.  Maybe its what I want.
Can we really help build a house?
Yes it is.
Nigger.
Thought youd never ask. Biscuit needs some gravy.
I did Claude. I mentioned you. I mentioned you both. But the fact is pardons dont come cheap. The kid can hit. What can you do?
Well alright then. What do you think about this new tie?
But Im not on the outside. Im in here.
Over forty years now. Me and Ray Gibson out there.
Yes sir.
You think you could make an exception just this once boss? She came all the way down from New York.
Claude. Heres to your new job down at the bank. I always knew youd make something of yourself.
Thats what respectable folks do. Get a job get married start having babies. Thats what you want isnt it?
Of course I did. He said hed file an appeal right away. You didnt tell me he was so good looking.
He seemed like a pretty good lawyer to me. His offices take up an entire floor of that big new building on 125th Street and he was using all these words I never heard before. He even offered me a job.
Ray Gibson?  No no. Hes the reason Im in here Daisy. For all I know hes got a record a mile long. I got a better shot of getting out of here on my own. You tell Maynard to think about me concentrate on me. Understand?
I really shouldnt. I gotta keep an eye on my friend.
Claude Banks.
You went to Monroe?
I dont know. Bank teller. Sounds like ladies work to me.
There is no BoomBoom Room.
Oooh...
That jelly you were talking to right here?
That was mighty charitable of you Claude. Looks like we both got fucked tonight.
He even got my daddys watch.
Life? Whats life mean? Theres no way I can do life. I got a job starts Monday morning
Somebody just told me he wins the threelegged race every year.
Gimme that. That doesnt concern you.
Cut the bullshit. What do you want Claude?
I dont think so Claude. Youd just slow me down. Wed have to stop every five minutes so you could polish your silverware. Theres no way around it youre soft.
Hell youd probably be half way to New York by now...
Hed be doing me a favor. Im getting outta here one way or the other Goddamn rats and shit Fuck
Sure it says Allie Reynolds right here in the program. Hes warming up right now. Man were so close to the field I need cleats. Howd you get such good seats?
Ketchup? Who eats ketchup on a hot dog? Mustards what you want.
All right grab the bat. Lets see what you can do.
My plan is on his way to Pittsburgh right now. That congenital idiot just got himself a pardon signed by the governor thanks to us but we cant seem to do nothing for ourselves. Dont you feel a little disgusted right now?
I aint getting in no airplane with you. Im finally wrapping my mind around the concept. They threw us in this shithole for life. Dont you get it Ray? Were gonna die here Might as well head up to the cemetery pick a plot and start digging.
I didnt do if for you anyway. I just aint no bootlicking trusty thats all.
That was five years ago.
You sure looked funny running for those pies bullets flying all around you.
Hes just a lonely old man. He likes to talk.
Goodnight Ray.
And what will we do when we get there? Im sixtyfive years old Ray. So are you. What are we gonna do out here? Get married have kids settle down? That boat sailed without us man.
Forget about that. You run if you want to but youre not taking this car.
I aint spending a month in the hole so you can take a joy ride.
Hes got my daddys watch Claude. I always knew whoever took that watch killed Winston Hancock. And that was you Mr. Pike.
You dont want to hear it you dont want to hear it. Theres no shame in that.
You didnt get ketchup?
Yeah? You and what army?
Im all right.
Grandma Dodis Pork Rib Joint.
Made just for you Cookie.
My corn bread? Oh no my friend. I love corn bread.
No they didnt get their pardons you dumb shit If theyd got their pardons way back then we wouldnt be burying them today would we?
I heard some things so I went to see Spanky Johnson. He told me what happened and gave me some money to get down here. What happened to your face?
He must still be in there.
Im going in for him. Hed do the same for me.
I prefer bourbon.
Im afraid Im gonna have to teach this uppity nigger a lesson in manners.
Are you offering me a bribe?
Theyre called subways. A nickel will take you from one end of Manhattan to the other. Helluva ride too.
Greenville that the nearest town?
Sure Ive been to the Cotton Club. Its pretty sweet. But it dont hold a candle to the Boom Boom Room. Thats where the real action is.
Me? Willie Long.
Im talking about old Satchmo nearly blew the roof off the joint.
You found him.
Thats NatchezundertheHill.
Greens the only color that matters under the hill. They got gambling girls. You oughta check it out.
But you do. What does that say about you Ray? What does that say about me? Ive given you a lot of leeway over the years on account of your father. But he didnt last long enough to teach you the meaning of the word respect so I guess Im gonna have to school you myself.
Adrian Im asking you nicely in the name of all that is good release my friends and get in the flask.
Absolutely not.
And hes dead serious.
You mother...
You want a queen? Got one right here.
Try four and a half. At first I totally didnt like him.
Well tell her I said hi back.
Stronger yes. Smarter definitely. But you have something he doesnt have.
Youre already there...
Hell be here. Just keep your cool kid.
I just need to find my brothers and be on my way Beefy.
Its not me moron.
It sure is. Now eat it up. Youre gonna need your energy.
Come on theres like ten million people in this city and the clock is ticking.
Sure pop. Whatever you want.
Cmon man Im just asking for one Superbowl ring.
Yes Jimmy.
Oh and dont forget youre shoving a pineapple up Hitlers ass at four oclock.
Put it back on my head. Im falling apart here.
I cant hear you Nicky. I cant hear anything
What was it called sir.
I gotta say this cake tastes a little funny.
By she do you mean he?
Bout time...
Gotta be one of his disciples or something.
Should we wake him up?
Were going to see Ozzy play at the Meadowlands right now. Wanna come Nicky?
Peppermint... alright.
That way.
Absolutely nothing. The Blizzard always came straight with his messages. But wrap your minds around this one.
Whoa that chick must be the real deal then. Later on.
Thats okay. I get messed with all the time and when I saw him doing that to you I just lost it. I hate when people take advantage of tourists. It ruins it for the rest of us.
Really?
My dads an optometrist.
Octopus people?
Im not sure. Id ask him but hes uptown talking to his contacts.
Am I supposed to not be freaked out right now? Because I am.
I have to Valerie.
I love you.
Right. And as far as household items we can share the soap but well split the cost 6040. Cause the person who physically goes out and buys the soap shouldnt have to pay as much as the other guy.  Arent you boiling in that outfit?

Let me have it.  Aboard the S.S. Manchuria. Last night Conway seemed to recover his memory. Kept talking about Shangri La telling a fantastic story about a place in Tibet. Insisted upon returning there at once. Locked him in room but he escaped us and jumped ship during night at Singapore. Am leaving ship myself to overtake him as fearful of his condition. Wrote down details of Conways story about ShangriLa which I am forwarding. Lord Gainsford.
Shes remaining in her room. She isnt feeling very well.  Now please go on without me. I eat very little.
Its always been a source of deep regret but the mountains surrounding us have made reception almost impossible.
A paleontologist.
This is the only thing I was able to save when those heathens surrounded me.
Sir Henry Derwent was knighted and he never got beyond the mesozoic era.

You have no disputes over women?
A Belgian priest by the name of Father Perrault the first European to find this place and a very great man indeed. He is responsible for everything you see here. He built ShangriLa taught our natives and began our collection of art. In fact ShangriLa is Father Perrault.
The only one.
Its weird.  Chang how old are you?
No doctors?  Thats fine. Thats just fine.
Sure you can help me You can help me jump over that cliff Ive been looking and looking at the bottom of that mountain but I havent got the nerve to jump
Well weve been expecting this particular shipment for the past two years.
Im sure you were. When would you like to start?
Thank you.
How can we get in touch with them?
Now my dear boy. You shouldnt
Father Perrault is dead.
Personally Ive enjoyed your community very much. But my friends do not care for this mystery. They are determined to leave as soon as
Oh the girl at the piano?
I knew youd understand. Thats why I came to you for help.
Mine?
Do you think this will come in my time?
Right Bob.
Come on Quick This way.
Aha  very good Freshie.3 Very good. Youd better put his name on the list and make out a report later.

Nothing about the porters yet?
Good heavens Bob weve been here two weeks and we havent found out a thing.
Porters?
George. George  do you mind? Im sorry but I cant talk about it tonight.
You cant leave George.
You mustnt. Youve got to stay here now.
So you think Im mad?
George I may be wrong I may be a maniac. But I believe in this and Im not going to lose it.  You know how much I want to help you but this is bigger stronger if you like than brotherly love. Im sorry George. Im staying.
Youre wrong George.
I dont believe it I dont believe a word of it
Theres nothing that would suit them better than to lose us but we must go on.  Come on.
As long as they keep on aiming at us were safe.  Come now child.
Wed be eternally grateful if you
Yes. Hold this pigeon.
Youre absolutely right. And I had to come all the way to a pigeon house in ShangriLa to find the only other person in the world who knew it. May I congratulate you?
Well I was almost born here. It took place in that wild country beyond the pass. My father and mother were in a party of explorers who got lost and wandered around for a year. When Chang found us only Father and I were alive. But he was too weak to climb the pass. He died on the way. I was brought up here by Father Perrault himself.
Oh youre going to make life very simple.
Bump?
Goodness no. From what you tell me about it it certainly doesnt sound very attractive.
Id love it
I tell you were going west and Shanghai is east of here
I dont know. Im a paleontologist not a Foreign Secretary.

Youll tell me some of the things I want to know wont you?  Youll tell me who runs this place. And why we were kidnapped. And what theyre going to do with us
Cowan
It means I know you think you got a beat on things.  But trust me you dont.  You dont even have an inkling of a hint of a clue as to whats really going on in the world.    And if you want to find out even a little youll shut up and come with me. And if you dont fine.  Go with them. Cause Im not interested in breaking in another little hotshot only to have him wig or die on me just when Im starting to count on him.  So forgive me if you dont exactly hear me ringing little bells and whistling welcome aboard but this isnt the Love Boat.  And Im not Captain Fucking Stubing.  Now Im sorry.  But this has been one long bad day.
I guess I lost
And Goodwill Toward Man?
And if I say yes?
I... I dont know air.  This guy. Mr. Best of the best of the best...  I dont know.  Its just still find it a little...  humorous.  Im sorry.  Sir.

Historys proven that where theres a nitrogenizer theres a 12legged signazoid.  They use it to make our food digestible for their systems.

Thats the Loch Ness Monster.  And... Kay thats... 444Eyes?
Get back in the car
I know you dont trust him.  You dont trust anybody
Thats my point.  For thirty years youve been looking through things and under things and behind things. Well what Im saying is maybe this is a time where you should look right at things.  He said our enemy in already here.  Well maybe it is.  Maybe our enemy is literally already here.
Do his job.
Actually it is a shotgun.  Hold onto it
Kay?
And I almost got digested. It goes with the job.
But its definitely a nest isnt it?
Actually... I dont know.
Out of focus?
The only thing I could think of would be... youd have to get rid of the queen.
Nowhere huh? odd youd get all dressed up like that just to be going nowhere.
Its... coming.
Nope.  Nothing at all.
Theyre not my pals
What if I dont?
Tell us the truth.  You dont just find these things at least not in this neighborhood.
Yeah.  Nov I know it looks normal but watch this.
Highway 119 just west of Smith. Why?

What?
Justice already knows.  Talk to me John.  Tell me whats happening?
The brick has been repointed the glass is original with new glazing bars.  I show composite mouldings with dentils.  Someone took care in the renovation.  Lets find the architect...

Cops arent allowed inside the temple.
Why dont you cut the cute act Danny and tell me exactly what it is youre looking for?
Ill write the paranoia off to the whiff you been doping on all night.
Wally.  This is Danny Witwer.  Hes from Justice and were to give him a full run of the farm.
It could have been a nightmare... Sometimes they dream about the old murders.
Rufus.  Shes a precog.
Tell me how.
Thats great.
I feel bad about that.  I need you to forgive me.
Once I even told him I loved him.
Goodbye Dad...
Hes alive?
No.
If I tell you my family gets nothing.
Im not.  I was trying to heal them not turn them into... something else.
Because these Minority Reports are destroyed the instant they occur.
Obviously for Precrime to function there cant be any suggestion of fallibility.  After all what good is a Justice system that instills doubt?  It may be reasonable but its still doubt.
Yes of course he knew but at the time he felt  we both felt their existence was... an insignificant variable.
But you will bring it down if you kill Leo Crow.  Why that will be the most spectacular public display of how Precrime... didnt work.
Inside the Precog who predicted it.  All you have to do is download it.
If... you have one.
Actually I think youll have to run out but yes thats what you have to do.
Sometimes in order to see the light you have to risk the dark.

Sean 
The Mets.  John doesnt think theyve got a deep enough pitching roster this year and Im inclined to agree.

Shhh.  You know what I hear?
Not after the vote next week.  Once the Amendment passes we go national theres gonna be nowhere to run.
Actually Gordon youre not gonna do that.  Im taking control of the team.
We can stop him.
I dont know why?
They could have been put away. Anderton could have found them.
Knott
Sure.  Raincheck.
Yes.
I dont have any cream.  Sorry.
Thank you.  He hasnt tried to contact you?
It wasnt a suicide attempt.  I regret ever saying that.
The FBI found something that belonged to my son.  A sandal... Anyway John was upset. He... he...
To what?  Trap him?
What does he want with a precog?
What are you talking about?
Youre Bobby right?
Good afternoon Bobby. Ill let Max know youre here.

Whos watching the baby?
Theyre not too classy to have tits rubbed in their face.
Leave me alone. I havent touched anything in months.
Shhh. Hell hear you.
How could you let her see this?
Tell you the truth I dont give a shit for me. But that little girl is so special and youre gonna fuck her up.
Whatd you say?
I had a fight up at Sportsmans.

This Welsh dude is tripping on Ruiz cause hes a Shot Caller.
He was uptown when I paged him. I gave him the address. Hes meeting us there.
She was fast huh?
Thats why they call it the smart money.
Mr. Reuben I swear to God they were out of line.

Ruiz knows about this?
Hell work it off.

Is it so unrealistic to think Ruiz who doesnt even want us here is throwing us to the wolves? As an apology? And I dont even know what were dropping off or picking up 
The what?
We dont need guns.
I listened extremely carefully. Nothing was even vaguely implied. He even laughed in your face when you asked him
You wouldnt even know where to get one.

I coulda dropped the bag alone. Its only two hundred Gs. But he sent you all. So I can either send you home and tell Maxie or we can flush the toilet one more time and hope it all goes down.

Shall I tell my sisters that we oppose marriage?
So it is not a matter of the breeding conditions or preparation of the meat. The meat itself is foul.
I can handle it.
Are you?
What have you set your mind to?
Well get to that too but this isnt just talk any more.
There are always slanders always lies. Youre reading the devils lies. Cant you see theyre trying to bring us down bring down the Messenger.
Woman have you lost your mind? Whats the matter with you?
Is that what this is about? Material wealth?
Shhh
Dear heart I love you.
Dont answer the phone. Its all right. Its all right. Nothing is gonna happen to anybody.
Malcolm where are you? Weve been calling all over the city.
Is my family here yet?
But we do know that the people of that region of Asia Minor from the TigrisEuphrates valley to the Mediterranean are darkskinned people. Ive studied drawings and photographs and seen newsreels. I have never seen a native of that area who was not black.
Please go ahead.
Women are deceitful. They are untrustworthy flesh. Ive seen too many men ruined or tied down or messed up by women.
What?
With him?
I know where youre going.
All them books you read and you still dont know nuthin.
All of your children are delinquent Mrs. Little and one at least Malcolm is a thief.
Youll regret this Mrs. Little.
How long has this been going on?
What does Sidney say?
Whats your story baby?
Me?
Lemme feed you sweetie while they hot.
Well bitch you move too slow.
Baby I got to let this old man win. Keep the faith and tell Billie Ill see her later.
Shorty this is Laura.
The hell you are.
Ive been clean for twelve years Shorty.
Hows the rest of the gang? You seen anyone?

South America.
Its a permit to carry a gun in Columbia. The gun youre about to find in that suitcase.

How do I recognize him.
I want you.
Your brother wants to talk to you.
Her life for your life.
And?
You stole the drop.
Dont lie to me
Ill probably kill them. Is that likely?
Creasy??? Where the fuck are you?
I came to visit you.
A bodyguard... Whos the guy?
You got tossed. Dont trust the cops especially the Judicials.  Oh you know that?
Sorry I woke you Ray.
Yes or no?
Time will tell.
Thats right.
No.
Once I get in the water but not starting off. By the time I catch up its too late.
Maybe. Did you hear him?
Its not too bad. Will it take a long time before its better? Our big swim meet is in three weeks. Interschools. I was going to swim in the one hundred meter freestyle.
It was in a book at school. Concubine.
No that was in Columbia.
No.
Could I stop you?
Thats not a question.
Now thats a question. I dont know about your Mom. For me the problem isnt in the glass. The problems in between my ears.
The foods fine. Sometimes I dont eat.
Youre paying me to protect her not amuse her. Right?
Because...  I was already dead.
Stay here. If you do something stupid we wont get her back.
Her beauty fucks with your mind.
She understands men.
Well see. And thank your father in the morning. A man always needs to be thanked.
This is Mr. Creasy.
He sounded strong to me. Stronger than we are.
Creasy is not a policeman. My sense is he could be very valuable to us.
Its a moral issue. On one hand youre cleaning up the bad guys but in another way we are feeding the problem that produces bad guys.
And left three more dead men.
I should start going for your tits first.
You just said it. Hes my friend. Nothing else to say.
This is my jurisdiction. I want these men as much as Creasy does.
I plan to. Ill even help him if I can. Hes going to lead me to the The Dreamer. Someone I want very badly. But Id like to understand him. Give me that.
Shes all right Andy. Its just that I get one Saturday night off every three weeks and I was expecting something better thats all.
All right Im having a fair time. Its just that I get one Saturday night off in three weeks and I wanted to wind up with something tonight.
What?
Listen. You people go grab a table. Ill be back inna minute. Ill be right back.
I dont know. What do you feel like doing?
Yeah sure.
Where?
I was gonna call that girl from last night. Take her to a movie tonight.
Listen Angie I wanna tell you you were very impolite last night. I introduced you to the girl you just turned and walked off. Now why did you do that?
I dont feel like going Angie. I thought Id take this girl to a movie.
We just talked.
Angie. He says she was a real scrawny looking thing.
Well he died. You know who else died?
I keep one eye open when I sleep because shes gonna come in stab me in my bed.
You son Thomas and Virginia they come to my house this afternoon...
Theyre the worst. College girls are one step from the streets. They smoke like men inna saloon. My son Joseph his wife you know she types onna typewriter. One step from the streets I tell you. Mrs. Pilletti ponders this philosophy for a moment.
This is something recent with me this bursting into tears at the least thing.
Im having a very good time too.
Youre a very nice guy and I dont know why some girl hasnt grabbed you off long ago.
Thank you.
Yes I know.
I dont.
I really should get home I told my father... Well I suppose a little while longer. I wonder if theres any place around here I could put some makeup on...
Actually I dont make friends easily.
Yes I know.
I just wanna kiss thats all.
Ill wait for your call.
Nothing.
How do you do?
Its a very sad business I tell you. A woman fiftysix years old all her life she had her own home. Now shes just an old lady sleeping on her daughterinlaws couch. Its a curse to be a mother I tell you. Your children grow up and then what is left for you to do? What is a mothers life but her children? It is a very cruel thing when your son has no place for you in his home.
Hobby What can she do? She cooks and she cleans. You gotta have a house to clean. You gotta have children to cook for. These are the terrible years for a woman the terrible years.
I dont think a mother should depend so much upon her children for her rewards in life.
Yeah. I was just asking you if you was here stag or with a girl.
Ill take you over and Ill introduce you as an old army buddy of mine and then Ill cut out. Because I got this other girl waiting for me out by the hatcheck and Ill pay you five bucks.
Well I bumped into her on the street and she was as big as a barrel.
Boy that Mickey Spillane he sure can write.
Well you see Thomas I figure the big problem is the supermarkets. But Patsys shop thats a specialized trade. The supermarkets dont carry Italian meat.
Thomas. He told me it was a very nice place.
Oh its a sad business.  My sister Catherine she dont get along with her daughterinlaw so shes gonna come live with us.
Sure.
She didnt look Italian to me.
Hey Ang...
You want a beer Ang?
Hiya Ralph...
Missus Fusari Missus Canduso over there shes inna big hurry and...
You just sit here I gotta turn the fire on under the cooking. 
The Stardust Ballroom. Its loaded with tomatoes.
Dont worry. Im gonna take carea the whole thing.
I just cant stand it any more Every minute of the day Do this Do that I dont have ten minutes privacy with my husband We cant even have a fight We dont have no privacy Everybodys miserable in our house
Sure sure.
Tommy I promised the babysitter six oclock.
Ill see you at mass tomorrow. Well sit down and well discuss the whole thing.
Why do you always put me inna position of being the louse?
I dont wanna hear anymore about it you hear me?
Waddaya talking about?
I told her she could use the kitchen any time she wanted...
What is Red the intention or the act?
Never this close.
Just one for a start.
You fixing to add overtime to a twelve hour day? The union aint gonna like it.
Well...  I was going to name you Chief Surgeon...  To consult on both shifts yours and Franks.
Sure you just blindfold him first and tie him to a stake.
Home.
Where you think you are boy? They probably never seen a olive in this country.
Pour one for Painless.
Four goddam months. And they dont even give you time off for good behavior.
...No cases over the age of temptation but deliver us eight. from evil. For Thine is the kingdom the power and...
Whats there to do? You found the sliver.
Duke Forrest.
Georgia where I come from its real if you make it yourself. But I been buying from the Yankee Government since they put me in this soldier suit and give me a rate.
Thats right pal. You just sit up front and sign the mail and leave the cutting to us.
Except we forgot one other small thing.
This outfit needs somebody who can find his way around the pulmonary anatomy when the bases are loaded.
You met him. Walt Waldowski the Dental Officer.
Whats he got to write for Gods sake?
You know damn well I nearly puke when I look at her. I dont even think shes a real blonde.
I not only say it Ill back it up twenty bucks worth.
All three of us played for our schools. And there are at least four other guys...
I dont think I could hurt one of them with a sledgehammer.
And Im grateful for you Frank especially with those boors around. Weve grown very close in a short time.
Shut up or Ill tear you apart.
A football game?
At ease. Captain Pierce you have a seriously wounded patient for whom you are responsible. Yet I find you in a poker game.
I want to talk to you Pierce.
All you have to do is ask.  The quarterback is saying theyll run the old Statue of Liberty. Their left end will come across and take the ball out of his hand and try to get around our left end.
We need medical officers for short arm inspection starting the first afternoon out.
Oh Im not sailing with you. I work out of the hospital here.
If you dont know what youve seen why should I?
As far as the greens maybe. I dont know if my putting would come back or not without some practice.
So lets haul ass Sergeant.
Radar
Be kind of rough on him if theres no blood. Why dont we close up and sit on him a couple of days?
Theyre coming.
We can balance that by getting ourselves a ringer. Henry has to say he needs a neurosurgeon and put in a specific request for Dr. Oliver Harmon Jones.
Not necessarily.
Honey nobody as pretty as you could ever impose... please sit down. Coffee?
I think we could still have a chance.
No lets stick to that strategy till we see whether you boys can do two things. The first is get that halfback out of the game. He had one year with the Rams before the Army got him but he didnt play too often because hes one of those hot dogs.
It isnt always this rough?
Ayuh.
Thats when the real strain starts. Three weeks on a troopship.  Poor baby.
Though I guess who itll really be rough on is your husband.
It could be a purely impersonal thing. What matters is the therapeutic value of relieving your tensions.
It happens to be a matter of life and death.
Id be crazy to think my virtue such as it is was more important than his life...
Thanks Reverend. Thank you both for tipping me off.  You dont know a Captain Forrest or a Captain Pierce do you?
Well one of the girls got careless and two days ago she gave birth to an eightpound AmericanJapanese male.
Every time we feed him it either comes right back up or he coughs and turns blue and has a hell of a time.
Thats what youve been doing all these years with every dame you could lay your hands on? Repressing your real self?
That. Its out of the act.
Right HoJon. See you later.
Finest kind. Captain Forrests say you better haul ass home quick. We got new chestcutter in our tent.
If you mean...  She is a lieutenant in the Army Nursing Corps Captain.
Thats all the commitment youre offering me?  Or do you have some more extravagant gesture of cooperation?
Theres no reason good enough for one medical officer to strike another.
You got to relax Henry. Since the deluge started you been working in the OR and running the outfit too.
You mean who hit who?
Ill tell you my news. Im retiring from football.
Yes sir?
Dont come so quickly when I call. I want you to take these officers...
Stop that ORielly
Oh get out of here
Morning Captain.
The way I run an organization any man in it has the right to speak his mind.
Its an American boys rupture youre supposed to close.
No we had a clear soup to start. This is a thick one and you ought to taste it. Theres nothing like it back home.
But its tenthirty at night. We cant get military personnel out for a civilian. A foreign civilian.
Yeah. You too? Oh Joe . . . oh Im sorry darling . . . why dont we tear the building down

Against what?

So?
Oh the Chronicle would consider it dirt cheap.
Hes perfect A baseball player. What could be more American
I dont know. He dont seem like a guy thatd fall into line.

As long as ya got one top Boss somebody elses always gonna be looking to knock him off. And thats war on top of war.
I dont care what anybody calls me Joe. Long as it aint to dirty. And if you fellas get together every year and say Charlie we still want you to run things for us I aint gonna insult ya by sayin no.
And maybe thats why he ended up dead in the streets of Rome.
Im supposed to be at my old mans for Christmas dinner at eight.
And if we dont invite Maranzano we cant invite Masseria. Guys dont wanna be choosin sides.
Is there a fuckin point comin up anytime soon?
They dont give a shit about us
Maranzano will think Masseria ordered the hit and wont have no choice but to start the war.
Masseria wont have any choice but to trust you. And as long as we keep the Boss alive Maranzano cant win without you.
Yeah. And no more Tommy Reina.
Yeah. Yeah. I bet ya feed Maranzano that same line.
Whats with the banquet? This is supposed to be a private meet.
Hell know you were smart enough to stay away Boss.
You know that if you come we gotta invite Maranzano.
Wassa matter Mr. Big Shot. Dont have time for my business no more?

But thats an hours drive.
Come on Charlie. We got business.
I must know more of you my son.
Don you talk about honor but you mean vendetta. Killin an more killin until nobody can remember how it all started.
Sittin around gives me the piles. You got a proposition?
What about the share.
The guy doin the job names the price. If you dont like it you can kill Masseria yourself.
What makes you think I give a damn about that Sicilian crap?
We can operate around these guys.
Talk English. Okay? I did lousy at school.
Shuddup.
Ill knock em in Charlie. I can do it. Blow his fuckin head off. Get rid of the bastard for good.

Good as new Its quite all right
I wish to ask the gentlemanhas he one shred of evidence to add now to the defense he did not giveand could not give at that same hearing?
I will not yield sir This same man Mister Taylorcame here to offer me a place in this Senate for twenty years if I would vote for a dam that he knew and I knew was a fraud But if I opened my mouth against it he promised to break me in two And I stood here one day and triedI started to open my mouth and it all came to pass. The long powerful arm of Mister James Taylor reached right into this sacred chamber and took me by the scruff of the neck
Excuse me for interrupting Governor but  that plasters gonna harden any second son.

Saundersits going to go pretty bad for Jeff tomorrow. Theres only one thing that can be done for him now  IIve written his resignation. He resigns under protestdenying all charges. No one will ever be sure if he was guilty or not. It leaves him with at least a shred of honor. The other waybranded openly in the Senateexpelledhell never live it down. Rather a simple compromise than utter ruin. In a yearthe whole thing might be forgotten
Jim its just that I like the kid I dont want to see you get too rough on him.

Jefferson dropped in for a minute Susan.
What Not Ol Honest Abe
Order  Will Senator Smith yield to?

Page boys
Who are you?
Morning neighbors. Morning.
Deeds?
Sometimes he whistles.
Never can tell what hes going to do.
Yes sir.
Yes
Your Honor what she is saying has no bearing on the case. I object.
What happened?
Mmm it tastes so good. Mr. Deeds I dont know how I can ever thank you.
Well Id like to  but I have a job to think of.
Yes.
Yeah I guess so. What puzzles me is why people seem to get so much pleasure out of hurting each other. Why dont they try liking each other once in a while?
He did?
A girl?
Oh hello darling.
Heres a guy thats wholesome and fresh. To us he looks like a freak. You know what he told me tonight? He said when he gets married he wants to carry his bride over the threshold in his arms.
Is he? Yeah I thought so too. I tried to laugh but I couldnt. It stuck in my throat.
I just couldnt stand seeing him again.
Were not going out tonight.
It took some highpowered acting believe me.
I even moved into Mabel Dawsons apartment  in case old snoopy Cobb might start looking around.
Yes.
Im having lunch with him today. He expects an answer. Its going to be pretty.
Oh as bad as that huh?
Come on  lets go
But what if they fall into somebody elses hands why  uh
Yes I know. A weeks gone by and we havent got the Power of Attorney yet
I dont care what I said. I cant strangle him can I
They are? I forgot all about them.  What do you think they want?
Thank you. Now dont touch a thing. Leave everything as it is.
Better wire him right away John.
They say if it hadnt been for Deeds theyd have gotten all the money.
Suppose you just answer Miss Jane. Now will you tell the Court what everybody at home thinks of Longfellow Deeds?
Yes I know. My first concern is to locate the lucky man. When I do its your job to keep the newspapers away from him.
See you later kid.
What?
Yeah?
Yes.
Not much. Hes an uncle of mine I think. I never saw him but my mothers name was Semple you know.
Huh?
Thats very kind of you. Are you related to him?
Nah.
Huh?
Oh I dont want to keep them waiting any longer. Theyre important people.  I wish youd go along with me Cobb. Theyre all strangers to me.
Only common sense.
Entertainment?
What do they mean by this  Cinderella Man
Not editors. Take my word for it. Not editors
Listen. Listen Longfellow. Youve got brains kid. Youll get along swell if youll only curb your homicidal instincts  and keep your trap shut. Dont talk to anybody These newshounds are out gunning for you.
They can have the Estate.
You see Mr. Deeds the opera is not conducted like any ordinary business.
Well thanks I  uh  How do you do? What is your name?
What kind of wife did you say she was?
Thats awful. The poor woman should be taken care of immediately.
Youll excuse me wont you? Ill be right back.
Why you must drink All poets drink
Take the stand
Well I dont know where to begin. Theres been so many things said about me that I
Oh yes. Yes. About my throwing those people out of my house. Mrs. Pomponi told the truth. I did throw them out because I didnt want the party in the first place. I didnt invite anybody. Mrs. Pomponi did all that. They just came to see what kind of a freak the Cinderella Man was. I dont know how people like that are supposed to act Your Honor but if that Pomponi woman is an example Ill stick to simple folks. She just came in talked my ear off and took charge of everything. If I were a friend of hers Id have her examined.
Oh yes I was getting to that Your Honor.
No.  Yes. Theres just one more thing Id like to get off my chest before I finish.
Thank you Your Honor.
Im a writer myself you know.
I write poetry.
Binge?
I dont know.
You gentlemen going to stay for lunch?
Yes lovely. Weve had a lot of nice weather lately.
Thank you so much. Good night.
What  tails?  Why thats a monkey suit5 Do you want people to laugh at me?  I never wore one of those things in my life.
Why Im assisting you sir.
Every man to his taste sir.
Miss Dawson sir? No sir. No Miss Dawson has called sir.
Better bring me some coffee Walter.
Who?
What sir?
How did they threaten you?
Take your time.
Theres no shame in getting a little therapy right Doc?
Mr. Cook.
Uhhuh.
No... a little. Theres a lot of debate about it.
Were you supposed to have a session?
A friend?
Dorothy Fowler. Fantastic woman. She passed last year in a train wreck. Damned Amtrak.
Mr. Follett do you trust me or dont you?
Good then go.
It doesnt matter how I feel about it. Its how you feel about it that matters.
What?
What exactly is it supposed to do?
My names Gilroy. Im from the State Certification Board.
Nope.
I thought it was  Nobody ever said I should have spent more time at the office.
A little.
Im sorry your honor.
No sir. I was empathizing. Sorry.
Salad nicoise? I love salad nicoise.
Youre terrible. Im never telling you anything.
Where am I supposed to eat?
Its a pleasure to meet you.
Okay.
Youve got to have the right ladder for the job. You dont know what youre doing you can get yourself in trouble.
Youre good.
Were going for a walk.
Oh... not a real doctor.
Theres something I think we need to talk about.
What do you mean?
No I really dont.
 the problem is youre a big fake. You havent got a clue whats wrong with that girl.
Could I see Sofie please?
About six months ago I guess it is now. God it seems like years. What a bore Im embarrassed by it. Before this happened  when Id hear people talk about this kind of thing  I thought it was a bunch of bullshit.
People usually have to get to know me before they hate me.
Is she against you getting help?
You actually address yourself by name in your thoughts?  So you really think having two opposing ideas in your head does some kind of damage?
I dont know if Im going to make it the whole way.
Oh... this makes me sound irrational which is probably right but there was something about him saying this  it was maybe the millionth time hed told me about some preference of his. Well I was so... tired of it.  Seems like my whole life someones been telling me... Im just not getting it right. Can we rest for a second?
Disgusting.
No thatd be a good story but that was just the beginning of the end. We went on for another year or so.
I dont know if 
Of course.
Youre upset.
No it is not something Ive heard about you It is someth  Why? Is there something I should have heard about you?
Okay...
Will you wait for me?
What do you mean in no time?
Its a big part of the show.
Its my bit for the community.
You been spying on me in the supermarket Nessa?
True. Should we stop them?
Im impressed. I couldnt make three million dollars if I lived three lifetimes.
Youd be surprised. Most guys have kids or wives or girlfriends. Theyre busy. Its not as easy as you think.
Well you know... thats the thing. Like I said just about everybody in town works for me. And its just not the same asking someone to throw a ball when they work for you. Its like an order or something... And no one  no one  asks me.
Okay then.  Have you got a lot of friends?
Really? Im the only person I know that likes Danny Ainge outside of Celtic fans. Maybe Phoenix.
Yeah.  Guys got some serious sex fantasies.
Sometimes its best to keep a few things just for ourselves.
Really?
Holy shit
You were messed up man.
Harder than I thought. Took me three tries. But I was highly motivated  figured there was no point in leaving me and taking that along. After two bombouts I found a place in the desert...
All new people start with that...
Everything flows from that and what doesnt... can be easily purchased.
English Lit.
Skip youre a visionary. That can be a burden.
There are a lot of lonely people in the world. Somebodys gonna figure this out someday.
Oh yeah very tough. But I guess thats good... to keep out the quacks.
Wallace Franklin... from Greensburg.
Relax I got him.
The ritual to bring the body of Anck sunamun back to life.
By reading the Book Of The Dead.
None of the above thank you.
Yeah well we all got our little problems today dont we?
It is better to be the right hand of the Devil... than in his path. As long as I serve him I am immune.
Intestines.
Who needs smart women? I put up with you because your mother and father were our finest patrons Allah rest their souls. Now straighten up this mess
 then perhaps the golden Book Of The Living can return them to the underworld.
No She has seen too much. She knows too much.
Correct And thats when 
For them to protect it like this you just know theres got to be treasure down there.

Got what?
I have no choice.
Yes?
He was the last Pharaoh of the Old Kingdom said to be the wealthiest Pharaoh of them all.
After all you rode us night and day to win that bet.
Whats it look like?
Be nice. That thing saved my life.

He was cute though.
I thought youd never ask.
Hes dead.
Think positive.
You know Mr. F me and the boys always loved workin for you. You had such style the clothes the dancin the elegant way youd snuff a babe. You were the King...
Really?
Its home.
What have they got that we aint got?
What are you talking about?
Good or evil whats the difference?
My heart died a long time ago.
I say we send out the word  and summon all of the unsung superheroes we know
Because thats what it is.
But I just dont feel it.
Theres a vague similarity.
So youre chicken?
Are you serious? This is the break weve been waiting for
The Eradicators
Hey... hes gone.
We prefer to think of ourselves as unsung... I am the Blue Raja Master of Silverware... 
Burgers all around.  Medium.  Rare.  Raw.
Of course. Im such a fool... Thanks Mummy.
Jeffrey... this is wonderful.
Who are they?
This looks like a job for Superman 
Sorry.
Shut up.
I got this cousin. Hes a real doofus but he claims he can become invisible.
The who?
The bazookas?
Crime was rampant. It wasnt safe to stay in your home.
May the forks be with us
Through there
I have decided to accept the principle of a negotiation the terms are not established.
You know General Kutusov there is a very strong possibility that the fire was not started by Napoleons troops but was organized under the orders of Rostopchins secret police.
For the sake of your argument let us say that is correct.
Perhaps it would be even more serious than that Your Majesty. His European confederation is held together by some very slender threads.  Your Majesty knows even better than I that Austria and Prussia are very doubtful allies and the Emperor has reason enough to fear that they will turn on him at the first sign of weakness.
If I can presume to go into the Emperors mind I believe that he has based his entire campaign strategy on obtaining a peace treaty after the fall of Moscow.  When Vienna fell there was a peace treaty.  When Berlin fell another treaty.  That has always been the rules of the game.  But what is he to do now if no treaty is forth coming?  He knows that beyond Moscow there is nothing and that if he withdraws there remains only a fall into emptiness.
Yes with all due respect I do Citizen Barras.
Where are they?
Who sent my wife and son out of Paris?
What cowardice  What treason Joseph has ruined everything.  How could they all lose their heads. They knew I was coming up fast. Victory was just within grasp. Come come turn your troops around General Belliard.
Let me see it.
Yes sir I had the honor of meeting them on the trip from Paris.
Yes sir.
Thank you sir.  I will do that.
A glass of champagne please.
I havent been back for ten years. Is your family still there?
It is the work of incendiaries.
Our troops have no part in this.  It has been started by the Russians
I believe you issued an order that all citizens of Paris must hand over any weapons that they have in their possession.
I told the Lieutenant my late father was General Alexander de Beauharnais and asked if there was any consideration that might be given to his memory.
My fathers sword means more to me than any other possession I have.
Im afraid he has been rather upset by the outcome of the battle.
Yes I am sir.
Are you staying with a friend sir?
Is it a nice warm room sir?
My dear Joseph the only thing that is clear is that my wife is a slut  and while a man may want a slut for his mistress he does not want her for his wife.
No Im afraid I never had the pleasure of meeting the General. This sword was taken several days ago from your son by some of my soldiers.
Now I know that I shall die if you leave me.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.  They were the easiest.  I made love to one of them within ten minutes of our first meeting.
All right  I promise.
Open the door.  Its me.
What are you doing in there?
Five minutes.
Not be safe?  What on earth are you talking about?
Im sorry I thought he would give it to you.
Hes downstairs  somewhere.
What are you talking about?
I couldnt face telling you.
Yes.
I questioned the maid and she admitted Charles had been Madame Bonapartes lover for several months.
And was it so widely known that Joseph had reason for such concern?
Before you quote the rules of the road to me Major may I point out to you that you are not in France now but that you are a guest in Russia.
Ah you must forgive me my dearest MarieLouise I saw it during one of my stays at your palace  at Schonbrunn.
Of course my dear.
You may have anything you wish my sweet and lovely MarieLouise.
I only desire what gives you pleasure my dearest.
Yes he has.
What you are talking about is a gamble on moderation  when I gamble I prefer to gamble on force.
He will stand by his agreement  I know him better than you do.
You may save your philosophy for the magistrate Monsieur Varlac.  I am only a simple officer in the army and to me what you have done is called murder and his always been called murder by honest men.
Monsieur Varlac do not pretend to speak for these good people whom you have misled and inflamed with violent speech.  Now I order you to come down from the cart.
From that moment on I foresaw what I might be.  Already I felt the earth flee beneath me as if I were being carried away up to the sky.
Duroc I have a bill here for 600000 francs from Tirot for building the Imperial throne and six decorated armchairs.  The amount is absurd  and at least twice too much.

Mysteries. Incredible body hookus pokus. Truth is we still dont know what they are or where they come from. As for nightmares...  Did you know that in the last three years twenty Filipino refugees in California died in the middle of nightmares? Not from heart attacks either. They just died.

And thats something we owe to Ninotchka.
No thats bad management.
You didnt get legal advice?
Yes Comrade?
Dont worry... there will be enough.
I must be stern with you.
Good old Razinin Is he still alive? How does he manage?
I dont know how I can get you out of it this time. How will it end? What will happen to you?

You mean you are deserting Russia?
Just looking around.
Oh yes but have you a safe here big enough to hold this?
Thats even better.

Yes Comrade.
No not a thing. Would you like to go out?
Sssh Once and for all were in Moscow
Yes a good piece of apfel strudel....
Why should an aristocrat want to go to Russia?
There is no privacy in Russia. This whole thing seems very suspicious. Whats the real reason? If you ever want to get into Russia take my advice... confess
I think so too.
Youre going to force us... huh?
Why should I take a chance?
Me?
Youre welcome.
You might hold this for me.
I dont have to but I find it natural.
And thank you for getting me up here. Ive never seen this before. Beautiful isnt it?
Now I didnt say that either... naturally nothing would please me more.
He takes good care of that.
Thats great. Im thirtyfive years old. Just over six feet tall. I weigh a hundred and eightytwo pounds stripped.
Im at a loss Ninotchka. You must forgive me if I appear a little old fashioned. After all Im just a poor bourgeois.
I dont like your following me.
But you have now and I know now that you are a man who employs business methods which in Russia would be punished by death.
Why?
Well er... lets drop it. I dont think you would care for that one.
No.
Yes.
Ninotchka youre jealous.
And General Savitzky.
A funny story?
No darling. Ill tell you another story a much better one.  The only thing that will be over on Thursday is the lawsuit. There will be no Thursday for us. Not next week or any week. We wont let it happen. Ill tear it out of the calendar. Is that a good story?
Darling darling... please
All right well make it red.
No No
No No

Good morning Swana.
We can forget horse racing roulette the stock market... our worries are over You remember that platinum watch with the diamond numbers? You will be in a position to give it to me.
I understand how you feel but there is a limit to everything particularly pride and dignity. They are willing to pay any price They have a circulation of two million
No and believe me Ive tried everything I must have telephoned her a hundred times. Ive sent her telegrams Ive sent her flowers... I asked her to dinner... I offered her seats for the Opera...
That wouldnt have done any good. Not with her.  Shes the most incredible creature Ive ever seen.
You cant imagine.
Is this your new dress suit?
Its a dream of beauty. He never takes my word for anything but I was right wasnt I?
Am I interrupting?
No thanks Swana.
I have to be simple again Swana and you may find it shockingly banal. Ive thought it over and Im willing to take all the consequences even if it means a complete readjustment of my way of living.
Hello.
Count dAlgout was for several years my personal representative and if it is necessary to sign any affidavit for him Ill be delighted.
We have nothing to discuss.
Wont it be rather embarrassing for a Soviet Envoy to disclose the circumstances under which she lost them?
No.
Yes... leaving immediately.
That is for me to decide Comrade Yakushova.
Where is it?
What is it Rakonin? Did you lose your job?
They cant impeach me for bombing Cambodia.  The President can bomb anybody he wants.
Hes nervous sir.  Hes heard youre looking for a new director.
Uh I would say these people are going to cost a million dollars over the next two years ...
I mean who the hell cares about this pennyante shit.  Goldwater put it right.  He said Well for Christs sake everybody bugs everybody else we know that. ... Its the coverup not the deed thats really bad here.  If only Mitchell could step up and take the brunt of it give them the hors doeuvre and maybe they wont come back for the main course.  Thats the tragedy of all this.  Mitchells going to get it in the neck anyway. Its time he assumed some responsibility.
Nobody knows more about this thing than you do John.
Ill bet he would.
In Richard Nixons long history of underhanded dealings he has never gotten better value for his money.  If I were to open my mouth all the dominoes would fall.
Im one of his people.  The Cubans are his people.  And were going to jail for him.
Its the fall of the Roman Empire are you blind?  And were putting fig leaves on the statues ...
The Old Man plays politics harder than anybody else.
Jesus  Did Mitchell know?
Mitchell?
Find out what the hell he was doing at CREEP.  This could be trouble. These CIA guys dont miss a trick. This could be a setup.
Well sir ... it turns out  one of the people implicated is still you see on our White House payroll.
I thought the gloves were off.
The hardcore four million Nixon nuts arent gonna go for it ... Theyll say I sold out to the Communists.
He got pretty burned at Chappaquiddick.
Can the president afford to ignore a subpoena?
Congress is considering four articles of impeachment sir.
So?
There is nothing in that statement the President cant explain.
Thats right ...
Howard Hunt is working for the White House?  No shit  This is goddamn Disneyland  Since when?
Our own intelligence capability  to fix the leaks?
You approved that before the fact because I went over it with you.  But ...
The Bay of Pigs? ... That was Kennedys screwup.  How does that threaten us?
Yes sir but ... do you think Grayll go for it?
The only problem with that sir  it gets us into obstruction of justice.
How is this national security?
He wouldnt do the makeup.  Said it was for queers.
Hes treading water.  Dont mention Khrushchev.
Chile Congo Guatemala Cuba. Wherevers theres a need for an Executive Action capability theres a Track 2.  In Cuba Track 1 was the Bay of Pigs invasion.  Track 2 ... it was our idea.  We felt the invasion wouldnt work unless we got rid of Castro.  So we asked ourselves  who else wants Castro dead?  The Mafia the money people.   So we put together Track 2 ...
Before?  Eisenhower approved that?
Jesus
No ... a little deficit wont hurt. Jesus theyre serious.  Whyre we stopping?
Please Mother it ... it was just one time Mother Im ... Im sorry.
What do you think?  He said in life theres no free ride.
I said I didnt need a free ride.  I need a suit.
Harold ... can I get you anything?
My friends call me Mister President.
Then find something.  And I want these leaks stopped.  Jack fucking Anderson the New York Times the State Department  I want to know whos talking to them.
Screw congressional oversight.  I know damn well going back to the 50s this agency reports what it wants and buries what it doesnt want Congress to know.  Pay close attention to this.
I promised the American people peace with honor in Southeast Asia.  That could take time  two maybe three years ... In the meantime your agency will continue at current levels of funding.
Yes.  And you will give General Cushman full access.
Is that why you and Kissinger are negotiating with the Chinese?
Black Irishman.  Very moving. Turning and turning in the widening gyre  The falcon cannot hear the falconer  Things fall apart the center cannot hold  Mere anarchy is loosed upon the world  And everywhere the ceremony of innocence is drowned  The best lack all conviction while the worst are full of passionate intensity ... But it ends so beautifully ominous  What rough beast its hours come round at last  Slouches toward Bethlehem to be born? ... Yes this country stands at such a juncture.
If things remain as they are ... Hes got the antiwar vote.
Yes.  Your old friend from Cuba.
Dont listen to em dont quit. Remember  Kennedy Bobby and King were against the war.  Where are they now?  Dont give em a goddamn inch on the war.  President Johnson bombed Laos for years and nobody knew or said a thing.  How the hell the Times ever got ahold of this Ellsberg stuff is a disgrace
No one.  Your property.  It would prove your case.  Why do you think Kissingers taping your calls?  For history.  His word against yours  and right now hes got the records.
A guy named Gordon Liddy.  Thinks hes Martin Borman.  You wanna meet him?
Just dont tell him to do anything you dont really want him to do.
I wont tell him if you wont.
A warrior with nerves of steel is yet broken by a thread of silk. Nietzsche.
Its me or Wallace Jack.  Wallaces third party is only going to help McGovern.  I need your support.
Jack were not living in the same country you and I knew in 46.  Our people are just not gonna sacrifice in major numbers for war.  We cant even get em to accept cuts in their gas tanks.  Hell the Arabs and the Japanese are bleeding the shit out of our gold ..
I beg your pardon 
But it must be done your government is paralyzed.
Not at all.  This is not going to leak is it?
Yes Mr. President.
I was the lesser of two evils.
Goes to show you all the moolah in the world cant buy you a brain.
You need her Dick  in 60 she was worth five six million votes.
One of the fathers was on the TV saying My child was not a bum.  And its playing like gangbusters.  Hell Hoover told me one of the girls was a nymph.
Youre shittin me.
Ernie Davis.
Oh I like satin I like pink ...

I want a divorce.
Are you serious?

Then youre dumber than I thought All youll get from their kind is pregnant
Yeah.
Now what on earth would give you an idea like that?
Like pick up some booze and go to a motel?
What difference does it make? If anything was to happen which Im sure it isnt it would be my responsibility.
What do you care? Suppose I was pregnant. Just suppose it. You dont think Id try to make you do anything you dont want to do you?
Lets just wait and see what happens.
Thats right. Lets get married Lynette. Lets find a justice of the peace and just do it

Great.
Already come and gone. Can you believe it? He DORed in the twelfth week. How can you win?
He didnt give you much choice.
Whered you learn to fight like that?
Wheres that coming from? I wouldnt fuck now if my life depended on it
Wrong. Ive driven a hundred and twenty miles told a hundred and twenty lies and said a hundred and twenty Hail Marys since I saw you. Hungry?
Ive never had a girl.
When Im good and ready.
No its okay. It was a great free meal. Everybody was so uptight I felt sorry for you.
Twentytwo years ago.
Ill try but this week we go into survival training so I cant make any promises.  Well thanks again for dinner. Thank your mom again for me will you?
Im not playing any games Go look at Lynettes
Why?
I cant risk it.
Sorry pard. Wouldnt want you to get an honor violation.
He said he grew up poor?
Foleys not poor. Buddy of mine in ohfour told me hes the son of a rich doctor down in Louisiana.
Yeah.
Thats what they want you to think but I saw where she lived what is shes trying to get away from.  Just take my word for it pard. Break it off now. Do it this week.
Im not your folks man. You love this... Susan?
I didnt ask you all that Sweet Pea. I asked if you loved her.
Lynette told me it really tore her up when you didnt call this week.
No but shes gotta be at least a month late.
Its mine.
I dont want Raoul to administrate that part.
Who else but God could think this shit up?  I spend ten years building those fucking rooms to keep people out now I gotta figure out how to get in.  God man He just loves the irony.
Just sending a message.  Shell get the point.
Okay okay  Okay.
FUCK YOU IM GONE
I know.
Youre an idiot.
I met him at the tables same as you.  And frankly Im grateful we have a little muscle right about now.
Yeah.  Kidnapping.
Shut up and let me think.
Shit
Adios.
Everything okay?
Stop asking me that.  Im fine.  Who called you?
No ball kid.
Its okay Raoul.
No fucking way.
If you think Im gonna let my half of the fourteen million bucks slip away because of 
The hell we are.
Nobody leaves.
Why?
I dont think so but I love her album.
Open the door.
Well I know that now.
The crowd goes wild.
Feel okay?
Shhh...
On it
He wont even know who it was.
Im sorry.
Im dizzy not deaf.
What if I keep dropping?
What do you mean? Were black aint we? And we care about improving the plight of out people dont we? Or you figure oppression stops at that thing dangling between your legs
But nothing we want full fledged membership in the Black Panther Party... and none of this Okay sugah as long as you stay in the background washing my socks and rubbing my feet bullshit either
And they sure aint from the neighborhood. Figure Sabus in there?
Fuck that weve got company...
You gotta. You gotta stay alive. You know what they were trying to do here. You got the pigs dead to rights. Its like Huey said youre more important than any of us.
Well as the Rev says God helps those who help themselves.  Well be our own stoplight.
What it be is You arent coming with us.
Thats just it Huey. The pigs dont know how many Panthers there are. Both of us show and they might start putting 2 and 2 together. Were not even two hundred strong yet... but we got em guessing thousands.
You know it brother.
Man ElRage is ElRage. You know him.
Whats with you?
Do you know how easy it would be for you to just disappear. Shit you wouldnt even wash up for weeks. Do you fucking understand?  I want you to move your ass outta neutral. I want a bunch of Panthers served up on a fucking plate. I want you to set em up... armed robbery
Yeah its me.
I dont know. Look around man.
Yeah and Im gonna start by getting on my feet. Working on things from inside the system.
Its a bit more like how can we help you. Bay Areas become quite a hornets nest in terms of subversive activities. And... well Mr. Hoover wants to reiterate that the FBI will be happy to assist local authorities in any way we can. On a strictly advisory basis... of course.
Chief Dorsett if the Black Panthers are going to remain in your jurisdiction some fundamental changes in attitude need to be made...
Are you finished?
Jesus...
...no full fledge alliance. But I think we should do a rally with them. Show that theres some common ground between Black and White. You all with that?  All right then Eldridge set it up.
Yeah... but it seems theyre bringing Malcolms widow Betty Shabazz to town to speak at a rally do an interview for Ramparts.  And they want us to help with security.
No Just harassment. Cant let it stop this.  Brother we got momentum
You know I think Brother Judge needs our support right now not our suspicion  This is beautiful man. Folks around here never read the truth like this before.
Im down.
Yeah I know. Youre smart Judge. You aint no bourgeois nigger like those Paper Panthers across the bay. I need every good man to help us with the security on Betty Shabazz particularly soldiers. You do solid on that I might have something else for you something real important.
They were empty...
Brimmer.
Yeah.
You got that right. And brother I got a feeling its going to get a whole lot thicker.
If the pigs only knew they were subsidizing The Panthers...
Me too. Thats why I fight so hard.
What you see is what you got.  Thats Bobby Seale.
Just the legit shit.
Yeah brother My best friend is stone dead.
Mothafucker You just set Bobby Seale up to be kidnapped. They dragged him off to some bullshit conspiracy trial in Chicago. How much the pigs pay you for this one Judge? 
Bullshit...
No man No Tyrone listen... we got to move man they got a warehouse...
All of the above man...  And then some.
Funny you dont look like church folk to me.
What?
Judge man. Watch yourself. Sabus got juice now.
I saw. I saw that big one  hit that police man. Saw em drag you off too.  They take you to jail?
Mom black folks been praying to God for four hundred years. Maybe its time we tried something else...
I dont know. I really dont.
Thank you.
That would be nice too.
I expect to try.
Ive just been inside the mind of a genius.  Lord Cornwallis knows more about war than I could in a dozen lifetimes.
No he takes after his mother...
Hes my father.
Dont fault him for having grown up on the frontier.  It was a harder time and a harder place than you know.
Oh right.  Baking powder we need baking powder.
Our governor is a bigger fool than I thought.
Very well then.
Goodbye.
Apology accepted.
Please accept my apology for not having done so sooner.
Prisoner exchange.
If thats your position then eighteen of your officers will die. Nineteen if you hang me with my men.
Sir.
The British army is barricaded in Boston.  Harry Lee is here from Virginia recruiting for a Continental Army.
When you have children I hope youll understand.
Its already over.
You know how old I am.
Go on.
Please.
Thank you.  Were I an orator those are the exact words I would have spoken.
Harry Harry Harry...
When?
So youre going to try to keep Cornwallis in the South until then.
You expect Cornwallis to be held here by militia?
How many men does Cornwallis have under his command?
Goodbye Harry.
Four five miles.
I heard about your son.  Im sorry.
For richer for poorer in sickness and in health til death do they part.
He looks as if hes sleeping doesnt he?
But its already been two years and thats two more years.  The war could be over by then.
Sixpounders.  Lots of them.
Quiet.
Well...I guess not.
But what if he dies and has to go to the Pet Sematary?
Anyone who can scream that loud isnt ready for intensive care just yet looks like she just skinned her knee.
Yayyy
To remember.
Thats enough Ellen.
Well I think Michael McDowell is so full of shit he probably squeaks when he walks my dear.
Sure carnation. Like in that movie you rented Audrey Rose.
Do you believe that?
You believe in it.
Same here. Come over and visit when you get the chance.
Ayuh I think twas. If I see Louis come home before I go to bed Ill tell him to
That roadand those Orinco trucks are the two main reasons its there.
Nope. The Micmac Indians. Whats up ahead is all thats left of their tribal lands.
Im sorry. At least it dont look like he suffered.
You going to bury him in the Pet Sematary?
Maybe when they call Ill just tell Ellie I havent seen the damn cat around. You know?
Does she love the cat?
The place were going is on the other side of that.
No. We wont. I have climbed it a time or two before and I know all the places to step. Just follow me...move easy...dont look down...and dont stop. If you stop youll crash through for sure.
No Im okay. Will I really be able to dig him a grave? The soil looks thin.
Dont worry about that.
No buts Accept whats done Louis. What we done was right. Another time it might not be but tonight it was... at least I hope to Christ it was. Now you make your call...but not a word about tonight.
What did we do Jud?
Stanny B. did for me what I did for you last night Louis. Only I wasnt alone when Spot came back.
Why...that sometimes dead is better. Thats all. Sometimes dead is better.
The power of this place is old and always restless. Sometimes the dead do more than speak. Remember doc.
Timmy Baterman. That was wrong.
Come onlets parole em.
Jesus the road
Yesthanks. Im Louis Creed.
Did you see his shirt?
Jesus Rachel whats got into you?
I thought maybe you did. I know you dont approve of the subject being raised
Youre doing fine.
Oh Louis I just dont know about this
Aye aye sir
Say the name or I slit your throat.
Wait as long as you like.
Bosun  Set up Mr. Sparrows quarters nice and fine ... in the brig.  Meaning no disrespect of course.
All right then.
I cant help wondering Jack why youre being so helpful and all? Last time you did that it didnt end well for you.
By the powers youre right  Wheres Jacks pistol?  Whos got it?  Bring it forward
Very well.
Elizabeth   Turner.  Im a maid in the governors household. 
Of course.  I didnt steal it if thats what you mean.
Will  you cant trust him.
Think again Miss Swann. Vile and dissolute creatures the lot of them. I intend to see to it that any man who sails under a pirate flag or wears a pirate brand gets what he deserves a short drop and a sudden stop.
Boy overboard
He can locate Isla de Muerta  but I doubt hell be willing to help us from the brig.
I am to understand that you will accept my marriage proposal on the condition I rescue Mr. Turner?
And thats what concerns me. Elizabeth we will be landing in Port Royal soon and beginning our new lives. Wouldnt it be wonderful if we comport ourselves as befits our class and station?
Is an occasion necessary for a father to dote upon his daughter with gifts?
Will how many times must I ask you to call me Elizabeth?
To keep it away from them?  No pirate would sail to London for fear of Execution Dock.
 but that was not a proper kiss.
I saved your life now youve saved mine.  Were square.
The trees are taller.
Dont be thinking Im not already working on it.
Aye and thats why I know where its going to be and thats why I know what Barbossa is up to.  All I need is a crew.
Will  itll go worse for us  for Elizabeth especially  if we fight.
Wait for my order  what the blazes is that?
You understand this ship cannot be crewed by only two men.  Youll never make it out of the bay.
As likely as not.  Will short up the anchor weve got ourselves a ship
Sorry I didnt know.
Smith.
No.  I can not just step aside and let you escape.
Surely youve heard the stories? The Black Pearl sails from the dreaded Isla de Mureta ... an island that cannot be found  except by those who already know where it is.
Why ask me?
My business Will.  As for your business  one question or theres no use going.  This girl  what does she mean to you?  How far are you willing to go to save her?
Aye  Avast
I worked passage from England as a cabin boy.  After my mother passed I came out here ... looking for my father.
You didnt beat me.  You ignored the rule of engagement.  In a fair fight Id kill you.
Barbossa.
Depends.
 and its guns and crew will cut you and your men to pieces the moment you step outside these caves.
The Black Pearl is a real ship.
If he were telling truth he wouldnt have told us.
Mentioned it is more what he did.
No.  She hasnt.
You got it Dr. Argon.
Have you found Dr. Bright?
You egomaniacs make me laugh. Natures going to bury you like she buries everyone else.
The only history Im gonna write is your obituary
Its ready now I know it is.
Now Icky I dont need you winding yourself up.  I need you focused and in control.
In the meantime were going to need someone to deal with that mess in the lab.  I dont think we should call Dr. Bright.
Nebbleman.
Yes.  Yes of course it is.
Poppy please just tell me what you want.
Dr. Nebbleman take care of them.
Excellent.  How long until the assembler tank is complete?
I want Trix  Mommy
Why dont you just put this in your pocket so when you see a garbage can you can put it where it belongs.
What did he want?
Dr. Argon I know you want to use the nanobot on yourself but you mustnt.  The situation is critical right now.  The replicators are growing exponentially.  If we wait much longer it will be too late. You have to use the nanobot to stop the meltdown.
Susan Dr. Argon is giving you an opportunity here.
No  Well not those exact words.
Wellie well Dr. Bright.  Youre just in time.
You know this and that.
Same old Daniel.
Yes.
Got it.
The waste.
Thats right.
No why?
No no I just feel wired
Blame the victim.
No problem.
I think it would be better for me to go alone.  Im sure Sim is looking for you.  Just sit tight.  Ill bring you back a pizza.
I was hoping you were over that. Remember to keep drinking fluids.
Getting used to it.
Like a glove.
Sort of.  We used a process similar to the vulcanization of rubber and added bulk with a chain of chloroprene elastomers.
Lets go.
Did you think I could just leave you...?
Its too late.  Argon injected it.
I guess they do.
Oh yes you are
And you have him?
Is that a threat Dr. Bright?
Just one question.  Since Dr. Argon no longer has feeling below his waist how is it that youre still able to do your job?
Dont worry four eyes.
Paranoia is what separates the secured from the unsecured.
Yes he might be.
Now Anne you remember how much it cost to get rid of that baseball player?
Thank you. Ill go and look for her at once. Goodbye Mrs. Smith.
Decent? Why Miss Schuyler I want to be noble.
No  give you another guess.
Your mother will want to kiss me? Give me back my letters.  Thats the breaks I get. Its the mothers that are always grateful to me.  Here.
Yeah. Oh its great. Of course it doesnt compare with this coliseum of yours here but twill serve mlady twill serve.  The architecture has a little feeling of Missouri Gothic  and the furniture sort of leans toward Oklahoma Renaissance  with a tiny touch of Grand Rapids.
Of course I am Stewart.
Got my initials on them too. Theyre cute. Theyre nice little things  what do you do with them?
Oh no. No no. Not me. I havent worn these things for Years.
Oh you cant carry a tune  you cant carry a tune  all you are good for is to sit and spoon spoon. Oh no I wont wear garters
Gallagher this is Mrs. Smith.
Why down at the office we always look at Gallagher as  eh  just Gallagher thats all.
I thought I was very charming Stewart.
Yes I said it. Sure I said it. I didnt say it for publication however.
What are you talking about?
Stewart would you mind telling me why youre not going?
Will you stop being silly Stewart?
But I dont want to meet your gang.
Unreasonable  Have you any idea what the place looks like downstairs? Do you expect me to stand here and see this place turned into a cheap barroom?
Your house?
You cant walk out of here like this.
Stop it. Anne. Youre behaving like the person youre married to.
Mother
Who is it you wish to see sir?
Thanks I will.
Huh?
But right now Im acting in the capacity of Mrs. Schuylers attorney.
Hey make up your mind will you?
Oh boy Id love it.
Excuse me Gallagher. I wouldnt miss this one for the world.
The human cash register. Got her hooks into the Schuyler kid eh?
Well  its only April.
Get going where? I can write that yarn without stepping out of the office.
My play.
Your valet sir.
Miss Schuyler  I mean Mrs. Smith  she engaged me this morning sir.
Thats a canary Who brought that in here? Canary huh? Go on get that out of here. Get that out of here
Yes of course. Miss Ramsey telephoned me. Well what would you like to have?
I hope not . . . Ive got to call on her this morning
I hope youll be very happy.
Well if she doesnt want to come Ill come down alone.
Pay attention? Im not paying any attention to him. You think that guy could get me upset? Hah Not that mug. Hes a tough mug  hard cynical. He doesnt know the fine things in life  that guy.  A bird in a gilded cage huh? Its getting so a guy cant step out without being called a magnolia. Stew Smith a magnolia Not me. Say Im not going to hang around and be a speakeasy rat all my life Ill tell you that. Not me not me. Im going to step out and mean something in this world. You watch me.  Say am I a lucky guy to be near Anne Schuyler?  Ive been hit with a carload of horseshoes and believe me I know it. Lucky Ill say Im lucky  Dont you think Im lucky Gallagher?
Well well If it isnt my old friend Turn around gal Lets get a look at you.
No no Maybe we could interest you in some well done butterflies or perhaps some slightly fried pansies or better still some stuffed shirts. And guaranteed every one of them will give you a good stiff pain in the neck.
Havent I covered some territory? It feels like Ive been on a Cooks Tour18 some place.
And theres her mother  and what a character that old dame would make with her doublestrength  and that lawyer friend of theirs  hed make a great villain  and theres you
Very good.
Sorry boss
Surely sit down. If I had known you were coming I would have thrown you up a waffle.
She did?
Double strength
Sure Im insane but Ive got some good news for you.  This magnolia is leaving your sweet smelling vanilla joint. This bird in a cage is gonna button his own pants from now on. And that is what is known as telling the mother inlaw.
Yes sir.
I just putter.
Oh no sir. I putter with me hands.
Oh my wouldnt that be tragic? To know that you could never be a putterer.
Thanks.
Yeah ...  Thatand ...

This is a bunch of bullshit.
What time are you gonna be there?
You cant be late though.
Dont puss out.
Can we maybe ask for more money on this?
Hey its me. This guy from L.A. Barry Egan is calling on the other line and saying all this stuff he wants to talk to a supervisor or whatever 
Nothing.
Are you sure?
Hes being weird Im sorry. I have no idea why hes being weird and dressed in a suit 
Ok.
One day Fanchon was visited by a surgeon. He ran his fingers across her naked skin pulling apart folds of flesh inspecting follicles...
Hes not the man whos cast a shadow here.
Why not?
Youll hate me now wont you?
Dont come any closer Abbe. Gods watching.
I dont take my orders from you not anymore.
Im not a beautiful young prospect ripe for corruption.
But isnt that the duty of art? To elevate us above the beast?
More than your writings at stake. The Ministry has threatened us with closure.
Whores and pederasts? Youre better off without them.
Valcour. His chair.
Your wig. Remove your wig.
Oh thats rich  coming from her lapdog 
I know because I felt it myself 
Why was it you never took her by force?
Then it mustve been love 
We inspected the body Marquis. She died a virgin.
It seems a particular patient of yours has captured his fancy.
A few indiscretions in his youth.
Playing dressup with cretins? That sounds like a symptom of madness not its cure.
Abbe I admire you I do. Youve a conviction... an idealism... peculiar to the very young. And so Ill be candid. The Ministry has sent me here with the most explicit... the most severe instructions.
A practical man sir. Given the Marquis unusual tastes a sound thrashing on bare flesh may not qualify as a deterrent.
Hes sworn to obedience.
 then Ive friends of my own to visit.
Thats not our intent 
What could cause a tincture like this?
A word of caution Sire we all remember what happened to Robespierre Danton and Marat. Put the Marquis to death and history might even regard you as a despot.
Im afraid so hes an idealist. Youll have to be politic.
Monsieur Masse says hed like another manuscript quick as you please. Hes got himself three presses and he cant print em fast enough.
I tremble with fear Youre bound to pound the quivering lips of my Venus mound
Yes?
Its because of the Marquis isnt it?
Dont start 
Theres something else I want from you.
The climax comes at a higher cost you must sit on my lap.
I pray you be succinct.
Oh you do do you? It is my dearest hope Doctor that he remain entombed forever and that when at last he perishes in the dank bowels of your institution he be left as carrion for the rodents and the worms.
I pay his stipend every month far more dutifully than I should.
Its tainted money Doctor.
And I in yours.
Of course.
If only youd remained true to our contract Opiates for his nerves Restraints The man warrants a bed of nails 
Its libelous you wouldnt dare.
How was I to tell you? By writing a letter? WITH WHAT MY ASININE BRIDE?
He refuses to be seen in my company He blanches at the mention of your name 
Not you too
She knew what she was signing on for After all she took the money.
Houdini mice.
Why dont you come down to LA? Stay with us for a while.
I cant
And he did.
One . . . buys things.
Theres nothing to explain
No you dont. You want to condemn me like everyone else. You want to point to the pathetic old man grown lunatic with his spending  trapped in his ridiculous
You dont care about anything except you. You just want to persuade people that you
A toast then Jedediah to love on my own terms. Those are the only terms anybody ever knows his own.
Huh?
Were using
Like a bug.
Sure. Dropped her out of his Lockheed over Utah
No baby those are the hands of a killer
The whole joint is half the size of Rhode Island.
Image the possibilities as this man controls the public perception of the nation through his
Were doing Hearst.
Dont do this
Then let him. What have we got to lose you and I?
Short enough. But this is a grand start And I think we need to change the name.
KANE. One strong syllable. Kane I
Uh huh.
Fuck you.  You wanted me out. Im out.
And how is the country to feel when this industry continues to employ bedraggled foreigners and swarthy refugees instead of real Americans? Doesnt Hollywood know theres a Depression on? Dont real Americans deserve work?
Christ.
Yeah youre probably right.
And we gotta be clear here. I need the negative and every existing print.
No maybe put it on the shelf until the old man kicks it.

But you know when Jake gets set on somethin Jesus Christ Almighty could get off the fuckin cross and he aint gonna talk him out of it. Im his kid brother. I got no say with Jake on this. He thinks he can buck everybody and make it on his own.

No take her home. I wanna be alone for a while. Everybody go.
You want the title shot or not?

Your weight? Look even if you lose theyre gonna think youre weak theyre gonna think youre not the fighter you used to be. Theyll match you with guys they were afraid to match you with before and then youll kill them and youll get your title shot. And if you beat this kid Janiro they gotta give you a shot at the title because theres nobody else. Either way you win and you do it on your own  just like you want it. All right?
I remember the first time I met Vickie... I know theres somethin up. I know shes doin somethin but I cant catch her...
What do you mean?
What the fuck they want? I took the dive. They want me to fall down too? I dont fall down for nobody. I never went down in my life. Joey what do I gotta do? Crawl on my hands and knees? I made an asshole of myself in the fuckin Garden All the newspaper writers make fun of me. Im the bum of the year. All I want is a shot. Just a fuckin shot. What do I gotta do? Ill do anything.
Yeah except fall down. Thats right.
What am I gonna do for 24 hours? I cant even eat
I cant tell. Youre stomachs in the way.
Nothin. Salvy was out of line. He was drunk or somethin I dunno. Anyway the windup was I gave him a beatin. Tommy called me down and we straightened it out. Its all forgotten about.
No I just told you what happened.
Youre supposed to keep an eye on her for me. Im askin...
So go ahead. Kill everybody. Kill Salvy kill Vickie kill Tommy Como kill me while youre at it. What do I care? Youre killing yourself the way youre eating the way you worry about things you dont have to worry about.

Are you drunk?
What friends?
Never felt better.
Hey but Joey youre thinking nickels and dimes. The moneys with your brother.
All right Ill try. See you later.
Im not doing anything wrong. Im just trying to have a good time. Do I have to be cooped up in the house all the time?
And Im gonna finish my drink. And Im gonna have a good time because I aint doing nothing wrong.
This is L. B. Jefferies a friend of Toms. Who am I talking with?
Well if he calls in tell him to get in touch with L. B. Jefferies right away. I might have quite a surprise for him.
Jefferies?
But his leg
Namely?
When the lock is broken  yes.
Because everything that mans done has been suspicious. Trips at night in the rain saws knives trunks with rope and a wife that isnt there any more.
Ill bet its been done.
She  was  an  invalid
I was jaywalking.
What time?
Too bad. The Thorwalds were just leaving the apartment house at that time.
Now how could anybody guess that? They had perhaps signs on their luggage Grand Central Or Bust?
Doyle  are you interested in solving a case or making me look foolish?
By morning there might not be anything left to find in his apartment.
Mrs. Thorwald.
You think hes getting out of here?
He has his wifes jewelry hidden in among his clothes over there.
You figured that out huh?
That depends on who they were.
You think perhaps it was old hambone?
Whered they take Lisa?
For getting rid of that cast.
I didnt ask you to stand in the middle of that automobile race track.
Well  you know best. Call you later Jeff.
Why should I?
How?
It crashed didnt it?
Dont you ever heat that stuff up.
I dont want to.
Shes all right.
Stella
I can just hear you now. Get out of here you perfect wonderful woman Youre too good for me
How did you know
Depends one which one.
Speaking of misery Miss Lonely Hearts drank herself to sleep again. Alone.
Its hard to figure. He went out several time last night in the rain carrying his sample case.
Its not an ordinary look. Its the kind of look a man gives when hes afraid somebody might be watching him.
You dont say I might just take that compliment as an insult.
Theres probably one in the basement.
Theres no point in taking unnecessary chances.  Give me the phone book Lisa.
To bail Lisa out of jail.
Jeff again.  Has Tom come in yet?
Goodnight Mrs Doyle.
Mmmm  hurts a little.
We sell a dozen a day in this price range.
For what?
No wonder hes having so much trouble with it.
Some people can. Now if youll let me explain 
Jeff you dont have to be deliberately repulsive just to impress me Im wrong.
Right now it doesnt seem so.
I have one now.
Tell me about it.
Youd better before you catch the disease
Someone not his wife?
I dont know.
Thinking about Thorwald?
Im with you sweetie but Detective Thomas J. Doyle has a pat answer for that.
You mean  like the kitchen? And make us some coffee?
Jeff  if anybody walked in here I dont think theyd believe what they see.
How?
Shall we vote him in Stella?
Lisa  I  I  cant tell you how scared I was that you  you might 
Think youve got enough for a search warrant now?
Give me some dirt.
Somebody find him a knife.

He hates me.

Yeshe started yelling for a handkerchiefscreaming.  He grabbed my face and he rubbed all my lipstick offhe rubbed till I thought I wouldnt have any lips left.  And all the time yelling at methat thingthe thing I told you he called me.  Then I ran out of the house.
Ill never get close to anybody.

You aint dying he is.
Who?
Was he all pissed off?
It makes perfect fuckin sense to me. Eddie you didnt see how he acted during the job we did.
How do you know all this?
What?
Really? Whos your P.O.?
Nobody did. You assholes turn the jewelry store into a wild west show and you wonder why cops show up.
Nobody saw what happened to Mr. Blue?
I got a bag. I stashed it till I could be sure this place wasnt a police station.
What the fuck was that chicks name? Oh this is just great Im totally fuckin tortured now.
Let me say this out loud just to get it straight in my mind. According to you Mr. Blonde was gonna kill you. Then when we came back kill us grab the diamonds and scram. Thats your story? Im correct about that right?
This better not be some Freddy joke.
...What bar?
You ever seen this motherfucker before?
How can you tell?
Did the two of you talk?
Where I was from who I knew how I knew Nice Guy had I done time shit like that.
Its a scene. Memorize it.
A undercover cop has got to be Marlon Brando. To do this job you got to be a great actor. You got to be naturalistic. You got to be naturalistic as hell. If you aint a great actor youre a bad actor and bad acting is bullshit in this job.
Something funny that happened to you while you were doing a job.
What for?
Mr. Brown stays in the car. Hes parked across the street till I give him the signal then he pulls up in front of the store.
What? Snap out of it
A guy named Scagnetti. Seymour Scagnetti.
What do you care?
She hooked up with Fed McGar theyve done a couple a jobs together. Good little thief. So explain the telegram.
Freddy Newendyke.
Shit you shoot me in a dream you better wake up and apologize.
What was that? Im sorry I didnt catch it. Would you repeat it?
Its a surprise.
You didnt ask.
You see what I been puttin up with? As soon as I walk through the door Im hit with this shit. I tell m what you told me about us stayin put and Mr. White whips out his gun sticks it in my face and starts screaming You motherfucker Im gonna blow you away blah blah blah.
I can take you to a hospital.
Lie back down and try to 
Well you better start thinking about it. Cause I sure as fuck am thinking about it. In fact thats all Im thinking about. I came this close to just driving off. Whoever set us up knows about this place. There couldve been cops sitting here waiting for me. For all we know theres cops driving fast on their way here now.
The cops didnt show up after the alarm went off. They didnt show till after Mr. Blonde started shooting everyone.
Uhuh just cops.
Thats the way I look at it. A choice between doin ten years and takin out some stupid motherfucker aint no choice at all. But I aint no madman either. What the fuck was Joe thinkin? You cant work with a guy like that. That motherfuckers unstable. What do you think? Do you think he panicked or ya think hes just triggerhappy?
You dont think its possible one of them got a hold of the diamonds and pulled a 
That was the plan we meet here.
Thank god we discovered in time. We hadda forget the whole fuckin thing. Just walked away from it.
That kid in there is dying from a fuckin bullet that I saw him take. So dont be calling him a rat.
Go down the hall turn left up those stairs then turn right.
You gotta idea spit it out.
Oh I dont doubt is was quite beautiful 
Oh thats really easy for you to say youre Mr. White. You gotta coolsounding name. So tell me Mr. White if you think Mr. Pink is no big deal you wanna trade?
Grahams got something to tell you might interest you.
Maybe you wont feel that way after I tell you what I stopped in for.
As far as  Sonora?
Its a nice place owned by an old couple named Wyatt.
Mostly we open a can of beans and boil some coffee.
In the grub box.  Toward morning the dew gets kind of heavy so maybe you better fix up a bed under the wagon. Spread some bunch grass under the tarp and the ground wont be so hard.
And look at it this way. How about Jim  it puts him in a sort of tough spot.
Are the horses stragglin or arent they?
I couldnt leave you sitting by the road.
The who?
Will she be dark or fair?
Maybe its better that way.
If its pretty speeches you want you wont be hearing them. Even when I mean em they dont come easy.
Thats right  worry about your clothes 
There wont be any rest of the trip. Over the hill is a stage road and when we hit it you get dumped into the first stage that comes along. So keep your money. Youll need it for the fare. Im fed up with you. I was fed up with you before we started.
Why?
Which ranch?
Like what?
You sure worry that bone. He killed a fellow.
Thats right Steve.
Sure. Youll find it under the wagon seat. Like I said before a twenty twos more your size.
I guess I have. You were pretty little when they locked him up. I dont suppose you even remember that time I was gone two months.
You remember Jeff Rawson?  We used to go fishing and hunting with him when you were so high.
You better start.
Ill eat when Im good and ready.
Like I told you half those horses are mine. Im makin sure they get to the ranch safe. So lets quit arguing and do whatever you figure on doin.
So  maybe Im old enough to tell you how to run your life?
The whole states lookin for em.  And theyre lookin for me.
Nobody asked you to.
I dont care.
He wont take us.  Dont you want us around?
Drink this and stop being silly. Why would anyone want to live in this place. You might as well be dead and buried. Nothing to do but look at mountains. In a week youd be talking to yourself.  Maybe thats what got you started in the first place.
Darling  now Ive got you all upset.
I like it.
Then why stay in the hills.
Well say it.
Depends on how good you drive.
They shouldnt have done that.
I dont like to see you go.
Maybe in Sonora.
Thatd be swell.  You know youre an awful lot different than I thought youd be.
Why not? You went farther than that last time.
Thats the end of the line.
Theres plenty of use for reading  youll see.
Hmmm... sort of like a horse  with a horn in the center of its forehead.
Would they be good to eat?
Oh I wasnt worrying.  I saw him saddling up and thought he was ready to leave.
Steve 
I think he wants me.
Oh this is too much. Im gonna have to play these numbers. Remind me to pick up a Lotto ticket.
Okay... maybe that would be best.
Hey Cindy. Your friend needs help.
Brenda are you okay? Come sit.
Hello Ray.
I dont know. He was right behind us. Wait here. Ill be right back.
Thanks. Im Cindy.
Yeah.
Wow shes beautiful. You really think she looks like me?
Alright
Hugh Kane.
Oh Buddy thats so romantic.
I dont care. You pick.
Its okay.
Listen no need for you to worry. All that stuff that happened before is behind us. Lets just try to move on.
This is Ray. Whats up? Where are you?
Yes Professor Oldmans group. Forgive me. I didnt mean to frighten you.
Thanks. I made them by hand.
I dont need your help.
We? What do you mean... we?
My child you are the only survivor.
Father I dont understand. Tell me what happened?
I told you it would taste just like chicken.
Why dont you shut up Professor? Just relax.
And what happens when all hell breaks loose?
In about fifteen minutes.
Fine.  Whats all this stuff?
That one.
Congratulations Dwight its begun.
Well theres a lot riding on this project.
Thats right.
Oh I couldnt do that.
Alright. Come on you guys.
Yours or the turkeys?
What do you know about it?... Listen the ghost is too powerful. The only chance we have is to use this machine.  I need you to go get the others and meet us upstairs.
Alright go to the belt store...
Father come in please.
No Im fine.
I am Tom Green I am Tom Green. Daddy want some sausage sausage. Daddy want some sausage...
Get out? What does it say?
Mom Mr. Stubbins is a nimrod
You dont think...
MURDERED?
Always the dentist.
I certainly did not.
Thanks Mom.
Looks good Mom
Im so happy I could shit.
But Chip...
Thats right.
Farrah Fawcett? Whos gonna play my brother? Is Jason Priestly available?
Leave her alone Chip.  I think its great she has a new beau Beverly.
Misty I made your favorite sesame broccoli... 
Its a shame. But they should brush their teeth honey.
Oh honey
Yes I did.
Not at first but then I heard the same inflection in a voice at a social gathering and I put two and two together.
Is this the Cocksucker residence?
Isnt this 4215 Pussy Way?
Its not fair
But... but... she... Rosemary I heard her voice Its her I tell you ITS HER
Yes I was.
Mother Did you hear me? Someone murdered Carl in the mensroom I saw his dead body
Rosemary honey. Good morning. Im fine.  Thanks for remembering.
Ewwww  Thank you Rosemary.
...Browsing.
Right here
Hes a good boy.
Thats no excuse for a morbid imagination. I caught him drawing this in class last week.  Is there a problem at home?
Well youre doing something wrong Mrs. Sutphin. Id recommend therapy for your son.  Thank you for taking the time to come to PTA.
Excuse me Mrs. Sutphin.
You forgot something...
I havent any money but Ill get a job and 
Yes. She bought my sisters business.
You think my sister is there?
If my sisters in that room it wont make any difference about warrants and things I want to go there.
Which room is it?
Id like to get out of here.
Yes I understand.
No.
It doesnt matter. You want to now. You should want to. Its your obligation your duty.
Youre not a dipsomaniac at your age?
She can only use cash.
Oh as beautiful as ever.
Shes nervous naturally under the circumstances.
I dont know. Thats why I came to see Mrs. Redi. Im trying to find her.
But I like teaching school.
She seems rather an odd woman to me.
No. She asked about the trademark.
Thank you.. .goodnight.
But you have treated me that way.
Yes.
Oh Im making investigations.
Good night.
I dont think thats a good subject for jokes Mr. Hoag.
Im looking for a party  a merry party.
We could tell him.
Not from me.
Im Mimi  Im dying.
Im afraid.
Why wait?
I wont get lonely.
You will have to make all the jokes because Im going to be very serious.
I can imagine.
Dont make me tell you Jason.
Jacqueline is a murderess she killed a man.
I understand.
I want to see what they read so Ill know what kind of books to give my friends as presents. Theres nothing nicer for a gift than a book.
What a peculiar question.
I dont think that you would understand if I told you.
You dont expect me to do that do you?
Tell me what?
I wanted to get things clear for Jacqueline. Let her know 
They may have found her.  Mrs. Cortez  this morning I told her Jacqueline was no longer under my care.
You know where she is?
It seems right to us.
Thank you my dear.
That wont be necessary. I havent much to say.
Difficult? Has anything happened to Jacqueline?
Sometimes she can be quite careless. Why dont you try Mrs. Redi?
Of course.
I dont know no Gibson. This is a restaurant. Many people come here.
What did he say?
No Nancy.Youve got to sleep two more minutes.
When?
I can quote it fully Mrs. Redi. We will avoid violence. For once undertaken violence becomes its own master and can lead to either good or evil.
What about Judd  he knows about us.
Yes Jacqueline. You were always talking suicide   of ending your life when you wanted to.
Are you uncomfortable with my appearance?
Oh. Well maybe Im uncomfortable with my appearance. I feel a little out of place in these surroundings.
What about it do you like? Im not being critical Id really like to know.
Yes. So you feel security stability. Like things are going to last awhile.
I knew him very well. We were extremely close until I dropped out.
Whats the first?
I dont know he just said he wants to wait. I quit asking.
Agreed.
Well Ive been watching you. Ive watched you eat Ive watched you speak Ive watched the way you move and I see somebody who is extremely conscious of being looked at. I think you really believe that people are looking at you all the time. And you know what?
Hah No Im not. Actually I used to be but the therapist I had was really ineffectual in helping me deal with my problems. Of course I lied to him constantly so I guess I cant hold him totally responsible...
Ann. Hello.
What kind of personal project?
Mostly. Sometimes they do things.
Im sorry this came up.
Why not?
What difference does it make why I do it?
Absolutely not.
Are there people other than your previous lover that you have fantasized about?
Yes.
If I cant do it all I dont want to do anything. And I cant do it all.
So you have had sex.
Who was the last person you had sex with?
So you lied to her?
But how do you know for sure you have to try to find a way to fig 
No.
As I said I havent decided what to do exactly. Perhaps I wont do anything.
Why not?
Because? Thats not good enough. I asked you a question Graham. I asked you how does it feel? How does it feel Mr. I Want To Go Down On You But I Cant? Do you know how many people youve sucked into your weird little world? Including me? Come on how does it feel?
Jesus Christ Ann. Why is anybody anything? I think you have this idea that people are either all good or all bad and you dont allow for any gray areas and thats what most of us consist of.
No Ann I cant. I cant forget it. Its not something I can fix. Its difficult. There s something in my mind... the way my brain works...  God Ann when youre with another person and youre... inside them youre so vulnerable youre revealing so much... theres no protection. And... somebody could say or do something to you while youre in this... state of... nakedness. And they could hurt you without even knowing it. In a way that you couldnt even see.  And you would withdraw. To make sure it didnt happen again.
You did that?
Are you having an affair?
I cant tell you how upset I would be if you were lying.
Is that supposed to comfort me?
Always the lawyer.
Youve made your point.
Quitting your therapy wont feed the children of Ethiopia.
I want out of this marriage.
He does.
Yeah I know.
Oh yeah.  But see Ive never really been into sex that much I mean I like it and everything it just doest freak me out I wouldnt miss it you know? But anyway lately we havent been doing anything at all. Like I said its not that I miss it but Im curious the way things kind of slacked off all of a sudden.
Is he still at your house?
Did you find him attractive?
But you dont have hidden motives for feeling that way right?
Hes not getting a phone he doesnt like talking on the phone.
Okay Ann okay. How about this you buy her something nice and Ill pay for half. All right?
What do you mean he doesnt want me to come over? Did you tell him about me?
Well what then?
What kinds of questions?
Cynthia who knows where that tape may end up? He could be... bouncing it off some satellite or something. Some horny old men in South America or something could be watching it.
You know what I mean you dont even know him
That doesnt mean you do. You cant possibly trust him hes... perverted.
Theres a phone here.
Why dont you let me tape you?
Yes.
It was warmer than I thought it would be and the skin was softer than it looked. Its weird. Thinking about it now the organ itself seemed like a separate thing a separate entity to me. I mean after he pulled it out and I could look at it and touch it I completely forgot that there was a guy attached to it. I remember literally being startled when the guy spoke to me.
He said that my hand felt good.
If you wish.  Youre not wearing any underwear.
Yes.
Is that what he tells you?
Okay.
So make an exception.
Goddamit give me my tape then.
Dont give me this passiveaggressive bullshit. If you want to leave leave. My life doesnt stop when you walk out the door you know what Im saying?
Meaning well have to cool it for awhile right?
In here
Oh.  Well when then?
I want to see you.
Cynthia. John.
You told Ann about this?
You trust him.
I knew it I knew it. Things are getting complicated.
Will you lease monthtomonth?
You were prying before?
Or go someplace in a hurry.
No.
Youre hesitating. I think that means you have.
John Millaney.
Yes?
He hates doctors. Doctors and lawyers. He never goes to doctors.
Was he nice to you?
I cant dummy. Hell see that the packs been opened. Youre such a dumbhead.
Meeting Rollo at Tudors. Might take a while.
OK. But late.
Nope. Damned thing wriggled out of my hands. Thats all.
I want to be able to see us Nick. I... Im going to go into the bathroom now and put in my contacts OK? Is that OK?  I want to be able to see us when we make love OK?
Just breathe normally.
Mr. Parkins what makes you think you caught these lumps of yours from a young lady?
You oughta be careful yourself. Might end up cutting your throat.
It looks like  and I quote  a disease to save man from his mind.
Id kinda like to come over there and have a look at one of these guys.
Yeah.  Ah I dont want to panic you or anything but I mean the way Hobbes designed them theyre supposed to get out of hand real quick so you dont have much time to think about whats happening to you. Once they decide to start pumping all those dynamite juices into the old blood stream... I dunno. But if you see some people doing kind of compulsive maybe even bizarre sexual things...
BREAKING OUT
Of course.
On the contrary.  He wants to see your ratings soar.  He needs a woman of exceptional desirability.
I am in Farleys employ  and...  ...were discussing a network deal.
I detect a note of reticence. Are you perhaps one of those amongst us who feel this emotive form of presentation is overly manipulative?
Bert brought them over from Europe.  They had a very popular series together.  Its still rerun in a lot of countries.  You must have seen them in Dentonvale?
SOME PEOPLE DO IT ON THE PAVEMENT
Shove it Ralph
No  I dont know what Janets next move will be...but you can be sure of one thing...it all starts here
YOUVE LOST YOUR CAUSE
SOME PEOPLE DO IT FOR FOR EMPLOYMENT
He moved all right  When they found him with fifteen other naked men at the back of Wilsons Bakery.
Janet.  Janet Majors.  Its just that Brad...my husband...is not... very well and...  I dont want to miss the next episode of Dentonvale.
YOUNG BLOOD
Im sick of hearing about that lame dog.  Ive got a lot going for me.  Im going places.  Im going to be someone.  Im gonna win my way into the lives and hearts of people even if I have to kill to do it.  Ill make the pathetic little crumbs love me. I dont even know why Im wasting my time here with you.  I should be with my people...
Arrest that man  Hes committed to our care.
Farley
Flavors

Yes Janet.  Leave the crying to Brad.
LIKE A DEEP PLUM LIPSTICK AND SOME THERAPEUTICS
No.
Were not confused.
Its all in the wrist.  You know you look really familiar. You from around here? Whered you go to high school?
I picked him up and I fucked him. Im a bad girl.
The wallet He took Dereks wallet
Then put him with the Feldmans. Whatever you and your Mom decide is fine with me.
Yeah Im here.
So I guess thats it.

Tight as a nuns asshole but qood concentration. Nice fruit.
Highliner.
A famous actor bringing me flowers on my birthday. Dont I feel special?
Oh that was for uh wait... That was for Spray and Wash.

Oh yeah. Real well. Still do.
Stephanie.
Hi.  Mayas in the kitchen.
You said you loved me You fuck I hope you die
Thats on us.
No Im an actor.
Well in that case...
Yeah Conundrum.
Yes. Absolutely. Despite your crass behavior Im really glad were finally getting this time together.
I liked it a lot. A lot of improvements. It just seemed overall I dont know tighter more... congealed or something.
Oh yeah. Much better.
Well then I guess it must have felt new because everything leading up to it was so different.
Ive just got to make one quick stop. Wont take a second.
Its her birthday tomorrow. And I dont feel right driving by her house and not stopping in okay? Itll just take a second. Shes right off the freeway.
Just a second. Guys going for 2500.
Shes a kid Jack. I dont even look at that stuff anymore.
Its not worth it. You pay too big a price. Its never free.
Id rather have a knife.
Whatevers closest man. I need a glass.
Let me call Christine.
Good yeah it is a rose. Only this one is rather atypically made from 100 Pinot Noir.
I dont know. Wine? Fermented grapes?
Its not even a mile.
Not with the wine list these people have. We dont want to hold back.
If thats what feels right.
Its going to be great. Heres to us.
You know her?
Now Ive got another lie to live down. Thanks Jack.
Didnt seem to me like thats what was going on. You were all over her.
Oooh. Oh. Miles. Miles.
Ooooh now the cards are on the table.
Miles I gotta tell you something. Victorias coming to the wedding.
Im going to be a fucking pariah. Everyones just going to be holding their breath to see if Im going to get drunk and make a scene. Plus Tony fucking Levin?
Youve all been talking about it? Behind my back? Talking about it?
Im a quick learner.
What?
Well she is cute.
Oh yeah? How exciting. Whats it called?
Ayeaye captain.
Im fine
Bathroom.
Well Im glad you got it out of your system. Congratulations. Mission accomplished.
Shes been leaving messages here too.
What?
Um... not exactly. But Ive been honest. I havent told her Im available. And she knows this trip up here is only for a few days. Besides...
Understanding of what?
In love? Twentyfour hours with some winepourer chick and you think youre in love? And give up everything?
Youre crazy. Youve gone crazy.
Yeah.
Nope.
They probably think my book is such a piece of shit that its not even worthy of a response. I guess Ill just have to learn how to kiss off three years of my life.
What exactly are we going to do?
He wrote a great one on Burgundy and I used to get his newsletter but then there were doubts about whether he does all his own tasting. Plus a couple of times he declared certain years vintages of the century and they turned out to be turkeys. Fucker never retracted.
Its private.
Sure Im sure. And just what are you implying? Im really pissed off at you about all this if you want to know the truth. Whats Maya going to think of me now just for associating with you? Youre the one whos sabotaging me not the other way around pal. Not by a longshot.
Jesus Jack. Jesus. And you walked all the way back from Solvang?
Yeah.
The plan is... you go.
Im fine. You rest.
You need a new car anyway.
So Ill see you at the rehearsal.
You know it. This is my friend Jack. Jack Maya.
The Windmill.
Try it.
Thats what Im having.
I dont know. Special occasion. With the right person. It was supposed to be for my tenth wedding anniversary.
What was the bottle that did it?
I think they overdid it a bit. Too much alcohol. Overwhelms the fruit.
Well its a little difficult to summarize. It begins as a firstperson account of a guy taking care of his father after a stroke. Kind of based on personal experience but only loosely.
The Day After Yesterday.
Like what a fraud he was.
Yeah.
Oh yeah. No. I mean yeah I stopped by for a drink. Didnt see you.
What rehearsal dinner?
Of course I was. I mean just now I could have made up some story but I didnt. I told you the truth.
Do you know what hes been saying to her?
Oh just that he loves her. That shes the only woman who has ever really rocked his world. How he adores Siena. How he wants to move up here and get a place with the two of them and commute when he has to.
Oh Miles. Youre drunk.
Ken.
Thanks. Um this is Ken Cortland my husband.
So howre you doing?
I guess.
See you over there Miles.
About four weeks.
About a year.
Quaffable but far from transcendent.
Yeah I reserved the tee time about a month ago.
You golf?
Where?
Bye Stephanie. Bye Siena Caryl.
It tastes old.
I heard them Morgan.
My ballet recital.
Me too.
What?  Colleen?... Colleen?
This is not an intelligent way to approach this.
Its broken Morgan. Itll just keep doing this.  Lets get out of the car okay?
That wasnt the answer you wanted?
Whats furry furry rabbit?
Good choice... Im going to have a cheeseburger with bacon.  Extra bacon.
They already know were here.
From what?
Have they said anything about our area?
I know.  We need to be sure before we open that door Graham.
Graham.
Yes.
I have some upstairs.
I hope theyre doing better than we are. We dont even have helmets.
Dont call me Father.
The footprints.
There are none.
I would say so.
Edgar it sounds as strange to me saying it as it is to you hearing it. But we couldnt see him. He stayed mostly in the shadows. All we could make out was movement.  But Ill tell you something with absolute certainty. There was someone watching our house last night. He was looking in my childrens windows and I want you to find him Edgar.  I need you to take this seriously just in case it is something serious.
Do you owe anybody money? You can tell me off the record if you need too.
Yes... Thats the first thing Colleen asked too.
Why not?
Youll lose the signal
What book
Your next water aint for three days.
McKendrick.
Im sorry.
I just came out to say goodbye.
Yeah me and Jake will be heading out for California soon.
Didnt Paden tell you that?
This is a brutal land.
Hows Mr. Parker doing?
That I do.
No Leavenworth.
I had to get up anyway.
Wheres the pinto going?
Which way do you mean?
I understand.
No hard feelings.
Ive got a job.
Shes gone gone to town. She hated working on the farm...  ...just like you.
The cattle This valley runs down to a clear creek. Thats why we picked this spot and thats why they dont want us here.
Whose law? The law here runs a man down  just like these cattle.
I dont believe in luck. I know what Conrad was like. Dont tell me what you think I want to hear.
We got married just before this trip so we could come out here and try the land. Its hard to find a man willing to take on a life like that.
His son is worse than he was. Hes smoother so you dont always hear him coming but hell do anything to keep his range free.
We didnt get that far.
Really?
I wanted a drink and a bed. I guess I came to the wrong place.
What are you doing here? I thought you were done with our family.
Oh thats just fine. Where were you when Ma and Daddy needed you? Its too late Mal. Now you finally show up and all you can think of is to get yourself killed.
Its none of your business.
Because youre my sister. Theres nobody else.  The men who killed Daddy are after Jake. I gotta talk to him.
Theyre watching the Hollis place. I cant get through.
Wheres Emmett now?
I heard that too.
So have I. Ive got a legitimate job now. I can use a guy like you.
Well Im real happy for you Cobb. But I think Ill keep looking for mine.
Nothing. Do nothing. Dont get between us.
So we understand each other?
Yeah maybe I will too.
I saw how youre putting Mal Johnson straight.
Yeah. Bad luck.  Goodbye Cobb.
I am. Im always there but I only shine at night.
Me too. Whats wrong with us?
Socalled?
Whyd you go into business with him?
Whos the owner?
Who?
No  I can prove it to you.  Ill take you to her.
No I understand.  Thats what I want to talk about.  I dont know if you know this Simone but Viktor and I were married once.
It sounds like you still have feelings for him.
We can hardly make a profit with them.  Upfront salary backend deal perks per diem percentages  Theyre mocking us Elaine. Were at their mercy.  We always had movie stars but they used to be our stars.  We used to decide who would play what role. We told them what to wear what to say who to date.  When they were under contract we could change their names if we wanted to  more than once
You can have everything  office car assistants  all I want is the picture.
I dont need a star.  All I need is an actor  Ill reshoot the part cut out Nicola and replace her with a real actor.  A real leading lady.
I dont know if thats going to happen.
Shes my actor.  There are other studios Elaine.  Theres only one Simone.  Leave the press conference to me.
Forever.
There arent any.  If the filmmakers are happy Simones happy.  She considers herself an... instrument.
Shell do her own.  Theater training.
Ill send you her resume.
No need.  She does all her own stunts.
Simone does not control my destiny.
Thats genius Viktor.  Was that Simones idea?
Thank you.  Ill tell Simone you liked it.
Oh make it live  please Viktor.
She said you were very beautiful.
I do?
Lainey and I just wanted to congratulate...
Shes lying down.  Shes exhausted.
When is she coming over?
I know.  I know.  Theyll say anything.
I would rather have you than Simone.  Believe me.
Not if I dont let her.
Every actor is an invention Viktor.  Dont embarrass yourself. No ones denying that you discovered Simone.  But its like finding a diamond in the desert. Anyone can trip over it but its not the finder who sparkles.
How can you bring that up at a time like this?
That sounds wonderful.  How do you feel about all this Lainey?
No... its life.
Right beside you.  I borrowed Viktors car.
Sometimes.  But just when I think your fathers changing for the better I realize hes as self absorbed as ever.  He took the credit for Simone tonight.
Just a minute.
He also happens to be the most talented man Ive ever known.
Is that a problem?
I just think actors talk too much. Does the world really want to hear your life story just because youve got a movie opening Friday?
Clyde.
It was more in passing.
How did the wall get there?
I know what you mean.
I need flesh and 
 You finished the film on your own terms thats what matters. Did you really do all the post yourself?
I saw her picture on the er... internet.  You really didnt notice anything  unusual?
If anyone asks about Simone 
Night Lainey.
I do okay.  How about you?
Ill see what I can do.  You know Lainey.  I dont believe youve ever once asked to meet Simone.  Dont you like her?
I could get the death penalty.
Id like to see that Sayer. Invite me.
I dont have time for this Sayer.
 I bet you have.
Abduction?
Dont you?
Why?
Which means theyre significant.  Incriminating.  Perhaps criminal.  Shes hiding her past.  Shes hiding her past.
What do you want  ?
 Cashiers check went out to our anonymous tipster this morning  worth every penny too.  Who says theres no place for checkbook journalism?  Well be running stills of this for months then release the whole tape  well get our money back  maybe show it on an exclusive payperview event. Do you realize what we have here? We have the only independent footage of Simone in existence.
Is that why she left you?
Yes.
Good morning Mr. Taransky.
Do you have any idea what this means Simone?  Our ability to manufacture fraud now exceeds our ability to detect it.
You know what Im talking about.
Why do you have to bring that up? Theres always risk  lifes a risk.  Its worth it.  Besides how could something so lovely be a crime?  Well I think weve done enough for today.  Youve been cooped up in there too long.  How about you and me go out on the town?  Theyre expecting us.
Three? We should hock it. Buy a C.D. rack for the bedroom.
What? You dont see enough of me at the store?
What Anna? What did I do? Whats made you so sad?
No just one.
Congratulations.
That Im a freak.
Upset words.
I forgot myself.
Dr. Crowe.
You havent told bedtime stories before?
You have to add some twists and stuff. Maybe they run out of gas.
No walking around like regular people... They cant see each other. Some of them dont know theyre dead.
All the time. Theyre everywhere.  You wont tell anyone my secret right?
Will you stay here till I fall asleep?
And the tiny hairs on your arm. Are they all standing up?
Yes.
I dont know.
I dont know Cole.
Dont give up. Youre the only one who can help me. I know it.
It means I wasnt what everyone thought I was...  I was a fake.
Yes.
Yes I am.
No were not.
You do?
Yeah.
Ghosts.
They want me to do things for them.

They were the ones who hanged everybody.

Book of Jeremiah.

I am not Im telling you its worth its weight in gold.
Cowshit? Are you sure the Aztecs even had cows?
It harvests It threshes Look at these blades.
Metaphysical question man.
Depends. You got some nerve intruding on a mans grief. I bet I could pull this trigger right now and call it justifiable homicide. Now who are you?
Aint nobody mentioned that name on this farm for 14 years. My boy was taken from me... far as Im concerned hes dead. Now I aint gonna ask you again.  Who are you?
Broke her heart you never visited... But I always said youd come back.
This is his room... isnt it?
Blood?
Who? Us?

What? You mean... I slept on this couch for nothing?
Nothing to tell.

Hell Starla. I always regretted that.
We cant make it. Just get away when you get the chance.
You took Bill.
Oh yeah. Fuck you fat ass.
What do you see? I see a butterfly.
Shelby shut up. Keep an eye out for these things. If you see em keep your mouth covered. Otherwise theyll go straight down it. All right?
Work thing hell Starla. He just wants to get in your pussy. Him and most these other ones around here. Thats where their minds is at them sick fucks.
Im sorry. I dont just have some switch.
Grant no
Through a wound on his stomach?
An animal that doesnt procreate. It spreads grows. A living disease.
Margaret.
Yeah well I kinda figured that.
Your what?
Whats the matter? Legend has it Bandit LaRues king of the road.
For a new Kenworth. Thats a truck.
Whaddya want to know? My sign?
Theyre both a challenge.
Would I lie to you?
Were cool. The dumb schmuck took the wrong turn.
You know youre not a bad passenger.
I dont know. We were planning on seeing the Astrodome.
Hes after us again
Yeah.
You want to lose this putz or not??
Do I know? Im an authority on it.
Then lets change the subject.  What do you think about forced school busing?
How do you know?
You take the front Ill take the back.
Yeah?
Forget it. This is one of the longest relationships Ive ever had. Im not blowing it now.
Weight Station.
See ya Kate.

No ones ever done it before. Thisll put us on the map.
Quit being so negative guy course were gonna make it. We aint never not made it have we?
Running blocker.

Pull your hammer back Smokeys coming at you.

Whats going on Bandit? Come on.
If I knew Cledus Id be on College Bowl.
Gods back on our side so lets get smokin.
Im cucumber cool.
Whats that pardner?
Ticking away but it looks like a clear shot to Hot Town. Green lights and white lines all the way.
Go head on breaker.
Bandit this is Mister B and Im gearjamming this rolling refinery. You got another Smokey on the rubber?
Some boy named Bandits been givin the Highway Patrol shit fits.
Chickenshit money.
 Road looks clean as a hounds tooth.
 Yeah I heard. But they wont hold him for long. Anyway he sure gave them sumbitches a run for their money.
Well we were worried about dust and debris from the work being done ruining the cameras so
Of course. Yes.
Only the mention made in that phone call. Theres no Swedish hitman of any renown much less one with a million dollar day rate.
Maybe.
Heller was buried in agency lore anytime an operative failed or was perceived to have failed Hoover blackballed their memory. Look at Ness.
Thats happening in about ten minutes. Israels at optimum risk of flight right now so we cant wait.
Have them mobilized. Ill phone security and have the elevators locked down and stairwells secured. We need to keep Israel sequestered in that penthouse.
Yeah uh  it was Spanishsomethin Garcia or Diego uh 
 he was wearing one of our jackets.
The other agent. He said he was here to do an inspection and later when he got on the elevator with the other guy Carruthers I saw him wearing one of our security jackets...
And threw us into the lake.
Yeah why.
Then what 
I got his machine.
I said I got his machine.
Look at that we didnt have to fill up the whole blackboard after all. Now do you know anything about that?
GET IN HERE GODDAMMIT
I dont have to do shit Which includes cooperating any further with these motherfuckers until I get what I want  Alright fuck it if we gotta hand em somebody from our end and theyre being hardons about it  make it Hugo him I dont mind. He needs that regimented thing that prison provides 
I thought Heller was a double op?
You think its possible he could be involved in the Israel hit?
 will be handled back in 
And you just figured that out?  The Swede isnt a hitman is he? Hes a surgeon. Sparazza didnt want Israels heart for a trophy he wanted it for a transplant... why?
So all of our intel was bogus to begin with.
Information was arriving all day yesterday. When we finally figured out who Sparazza actually was we 
Nah nuthin on my end 
 okay ghead 
Yeah yaint heard the punchline yet and before I get to it one more thing I heard little curious should probably bring it up... Primo wants Israels heart. The actual thing the organ.
Hey we nab Israel they pay tgetm back Ill cut the fuckin thing out mself no extra charge. My thing is we crew up lets not fuck around someones cousin some Zip off the boat from Naples lets get pros people who know how to behave.
A million flat.
Well uh  damn alright so hes headed in does that  where does that leave us?
I probably woulda busted on you too... and what a shame that woulda been.
I aint even goin dignify that. You my road dog. We threw up sets.  Plus you stank.
I can trust Rheya.
Youre not Gibarian...
All right.
The same thing that could happen to any of us.
What?
How much sleep?
What was it?
Im just trying to find an explanation for the continual reappearances.
Consciousness is enough thats all Ive saying.  Consciousness should be enough for anybody.
But why is it doing what its doing? Given its resources it could have done anything.  Presented me with your double and you with mine.
Yes.
Her oxygen would have run out.
I wont be making the trip.
Why?
Yes.
Book?
He does have a point.  Thats just not the way Id like to see it proven.
Its a violent response to something we havent figured out.  Dont let the cowardly demeanor fool you He is ruthless.  Unblinking in his prejudice.
For a reason that neither of us understand you are forced to stay near me.  Thats all I know right now.
Neither can I.  Not any of it. Theres no reference point for whats going on its never happened before. Its a clean break in the fabric of the Universe a gap.  There is nothing to do but experience it momentto moment and not let it destroy us.
I want you here.
Yes.  I told you.  It was exactly like mine.
I want to stop taking those pills.
You must have been dreaming.
Im sorry.  Im not sure how this works.  I have to go out... is that all right?
Lieutenant Garber said that in all likelihood there was no real danger is that true?
He thinks youre being a little careless.  He made the point several times.
Beg pardon?
I got money.
If I had known I was going to have company he was right next to me.  I think he heard me peeing  I hate that I am glad hes in jail.
Urdu and Hindi.
Theyre kind of fuzzy.
No kidding.
No no seriously  Theres a study done on this you walk this way the muggers are gonna single you out.
Hey.  This is my business.  Do I tell you your business.
You dont like him do you?
Hes very caring in his way.  You havent seen him at his best.
No youll be safe.  Were gonna pick him up again...
Claire...
Let go
More bullshit  More bullshit  What kind of odds are they giving me?  There must be some kind of office pool.  One month?  A couple of days?
They called here after you left...
Pretty far.  Im told not to say anything about it on the phone in case its tapped... they think its best safer if I go away at least till Venzas found.
Tomorrow night.  Can you come?
Do you dance?
Pretty bad.
Yeah.
I know.
I dont know...
It was something my father always liked me to do.
Nothing.
Sure we are lets go
Too kinky.
Amen to that.  The supermarkets full of assholes.
Til they pick up the perp.  Seniority gets day shift... You know what that means.
I can still use a gun.
I think televisions a dangerous thing.
Let em eat their hearts out.
Oh some shit.
I dont know that Ellie.  He might get out.  Garbers not bein straight with the witness she could be in deep shit if she identifies him and its my job to convince her she wont be.
Why?
No  No  Im sorry.  Ninetyseven five right?
She didnt like the other one so she picked this one.
Ellie it was a formal party...
She bought it.
Take it easy  I set her up.  I saw it coming.
I dont remember Michael go to sleep.  You dont have to make conversation with me.
Well.  Thisll be over soon. Venzas such a nut job were bound to pick him up soon.
You talked to his wife?
Im all right.
Me neither.
You apprehended him after he gave himself up 
If she identifies him.  Where the fuck were you anyway cowboy  Venza was meat.  He walked right past you and now were the ones playing catchup  You better hope she identifies him.
Koontz  I need you guys
Bad fuckin news.  Even the families dropped him when they found they had a fruitcake on their hands.  But he knows where a lot of bodies are buried.  Itd cap it for Garber if he could bring him in.
Sir I am just trying to do my job its standard procedure to question the witness alone.  Help me out here could you please leave.
Thats right youre gonna do what I say.  Joey.  I want to help you out of this.
I get my hostage first.  No ones turned loose until I say so.
Oh beware of jealousy my lord the greeneyed monster...
You stop him?
No no.
Oh come on Ben thats not
I was sort of hoping to get out of
Theyll never take me alive.
Well Ive missed a lot of classes myself...
Oh look Mr. Hogan Im really sorry about what happened in there. Really
Right.
I dont submit to blackmail  The first amendment protects my freedom to tell the news as I imagine it and
Sorry. Im still getting the hang of this.
Just call me Spidey.
Well...
When Peter was little he loved to hide.  In closets under the sink. He needed a secret place.  But when Id look for him hed laugh... he wanted to be found.
I hate your relatives I hate your coffee I hate your shoes.
Thank God.
So?  The next day Id read Peter Parker murdered and Id feel...
Listen.  You think youre responsible for everything that happens.  Dont flagellate yourself  and dont flatter yourself either.  Youre not the center of the universe. Youre just... Peter.
Hello.  So very boring.  Peter Parker how do you feel about me this morning?
But you said he went off a little after the accident when those mechanical arms
Your records are older than you are.  Have you never heard of new wave?
Yes.  Do you have a date?
Itll shut itself off.
How is he?
Ach theories  This was first hand experiential knowledge the essence of the universe.
Oh Roz.  My mind is so far beyond yours now.  I could beat you at chess now.
Actually I got this spider bite
Luck.  The right place at the right time.
Oh. Yeah.  Thanks.
Oh I dont know thanks Mr. Reiss but
Explain that some jerk in a mask and costume fought a mad scientist with four tentacles?
Yeah just a lung full of New Jersey.  Lucky you showed up when you did.
Imagine how I feel.
Just drop me off here.
Sure in the war.  Pull those cables
Is you all little Adolfs?
I dont have to think. We didnt tell anything to anybody. Not a word. Not until we hit this barrack.
Thatll do.
In this barracks?
Anybody here wanna double their bet?
You stink Sefton
Maybe its going to be a longer war than you figured  eh Duke?
Thats right.
Lets get on with what? What is this anyway? A Kangaroo Court? Why dont you get a rope and do it right?
Ill call the whole pot.
Easy Walked right through the gate past the guard. Like he was some Kraut Field Marshal.
Only he aint quite finished yet. Blondie  get that smudge pot. Tie it to Steves leg.
Such nice boys It makes me sick to 
Twentyfive.
What is your number?
That is correct.  Lieutenant Dunbar I came to apologize for the accommodations. Ordinarily of course we never put officers up with enlisted men.
Abfuehren
I want to sleep... I havent slept for three days.
They also smell of moth balls.  When were they issued? This morning?
All I know is he did it. I am satisfied.
Some are not bad at all.
Droppen Sie dead  Raus mit dem Ofen. Los Los
Whats the award?
Blind? How stupid can you get Animal? I drank the stuff myself.
What do they always say?
You want to go?
Yes sir.
Kill it Duke. Its got us all spinning.
Maybe its crazy but its better than having Dunbar dead.
Good.
You have elected me Security. The way things have been going in this Barracks I guess Ive done a poor job and I want to make up for it. Is that asking too much?
Because thats where he is. In the water tank.
Lay off Schulz. Hes got a sickness. Hes krank.
One more thing gentlemen. The Kommandant told me to pick up the radio.
Just one question. Did you calculate the risk?
Are we boring you?
Says who?
Thats right. Or would you rather see Dunbar lying out there in the mud tomorrow morning like Manfredi and Johnson?
You told them Hoffy.
Uhhuh. Fell right on my head.  Sprechen sie deutsch?
Just one little thing. How come you were so sure Manfredi and Johnson wouldnt get out of the forest?
Maybe just one word? Kaput? Because youre kaput Price.
What time?
Suppose you let those mattresses cool off a little  just out of decency?
Ich weiss alles.
Here. Take them.
Talk what? I do not know anything
Not particularly.
Well put pink ribbons on the bedbugs.
Maybe those Russian dames would take him.
He is.
The stars destruction has had numerous astrophysical effects within this sector. However none of them appear to have a connection to the energy ribbon.
No sir. I am finding it difficult to concentrate. I believe I am overwhelmed with feelings of remorse and regret concerning my actions on the observatory.
Guilt. It is a most unpleasant feeling.
I believe so.
I believe so.
You get what?
The station complement was nineteen.
I hope so sir.
All hands brace for impact
Wherever he wanted to be.
Yes where would you go?
Yes yes it is.
Im from what you would consider the future the 24thcentury.
Not exactly. As I said this is some kind of
Better?
Least I could do for a captain of the Enterprise.
What do you mean youre not going? We promised.
And what would that be sir?
No.
No I didnt know that.
No sir.
Understood. That will be all.
A quantum implosion has occurred within the Amargosa star. All nuclearfusion is breaking down.
Yes. Fine. If youll excuse me.
What I cant get out of my mind is the image of Rene my nephew. I just cant believe hes gone.
Mr. Data scan the planet for lifeforms.
Why were they looking for it on a Federation observatory? It doesnt make any sense.
Lursa and BEtor? This doesnt make any sense. A renowned stellar physicist somehow uses a trilithium probe to destroy a star kidnaps Geordi and escapes with a pair of Klingon renegades. Why? What the hells going on?
If he tries to get away with Warp Drive hes really in for a shock...
He has been here for some time. I can feel his presence.
Yes sir I sealed the room myself. Nevertheless  I am reading a life form there.
I cant get an answer. Starfleet is up to its brass in galactic conference. No one has time for those who only stand... and wait.
Message acknowledged. All units will be informed.
Mr. Scott we need everything youve got now.
Nothing. As before.
Short range scan Mr. Chekov... On screen Mr. Sulu.
It has to be. Gravitational fields were in flux... It must have soft landed...
Like your father... so human.  All units functional recorders are on... Scanning sector one. Foliage in fully developed state of growth. Temperature twenty two point two Celsius.
A photon tube...
My mother knew nothing about it. Thats why I asked her to leave Genesis in my hands.
... How long?
Ill go...
Yes Saavik go ahead...
I know but  lets do it by the book. Stand by on this channel.  Go.
Sir...?
Saavik... Is... David with you?
But we have Spock alive Thats more than we bargained for
And if they dont.? What will Happen to Spock?
The word is no.  I am therefore going anyway.
Ill need it Sulu.
... A cloaking device?
Its been a while sir. Here we go... Retrothrusters
Approach control... this is Enterprise. Ready for docking maneuver.
Thats the good news. Hes home in bed full of tranquilizers and he promised me hed UstayU there... They say its exhaustion...  Well see.
Thats out of the question. No one is going to Genesis
Dont quote rules Harry Were talking about loyalty. And sacrifice. One man who died for us another who has deep emotional damage 
Any time.
All right damn you All right  Give me a minute to inform my crew.
You should take the Vulcan too.
You fool  look around you This planet is destroying itself
He would not have spoken of it openly.
One alive one not. Yet both in pain.
Success my lord.
Good.  This is the turn of luck I have been waiting for.
They are useless It was Kirk I needed. And I let him slip away.
Im afraid I cant stop to discuss this logically 
I only use it for medicinal purposes. Dont be a pring...
Four hundred years old. You dont find many with the lens still intact.
Amazing I dont know what to say 
And who am I hiding from?
Im your doctor and Im your friend Jim. Get back your command. Get it back before you really do grow old. Before you turn into part of this collection.
Ah.
As a physician you of all people should appreciate the danger of reopening old wounds.
This one looks like a Steward. Theyre not warm but rigor hasnt set in. This didnt happen all that long ago Jim.
And almost got tossed out of the Academy...
Why? Why didnt you tell me?
And bored. I know. But maybe it IS something they can...
Mother go back
Weve picked up a minor energy flux reading on one dyno scanner.
Ssssh
Whats the matter  ?
Marooned on Ceti Alpha V. Hes completely mad Admiral. He blames you for the death of his wife...
Then to whom do you report directly regarding Genesis?
I see. Helmsman?
uWe were still thereu you dumb bastard We could hear the screams all the way to the transporter room 
Shes making it up My father was Professor 
uFull power damn youu
Aye sir.
Scotty lets have it.
My sisters youngest Admiral. Crazy to get to space.
All right well do the job with auxiliary power.
Engine room reports auxiliary power restored. We can proceed at impulse power.
Right on schedule Admiral. Just give us your coordinates and well beam you aboard.
Welcome aboard Admiral. I believe you know my trainee crew. Certainly they have come to know you.
Regula I is a scientific research laboratory if memory serves...
Excuse my presumption but I do not agree. As a teacher on a training mission I am content to command a Starship. If we are to go on actual duty it is clear that the senior officer aboard must assume command.
You proceed from a false assumption. I am a Vulcan. I have no ego to bruise.
Id best talk with Mr. Scott first so that he may in his own words explain the situation to his cadets.
The power of creation 
Chekovs on Reliant isnt he?
It would explain a great many things 
Raise shields Energize phasers stand by to 
Who the uhellu are they?
Its all weve got.
Engine room... Scotty do we have enough power for the transporters?
Yes sir.
Transmission jammed at the source sir.
There is no correct resolution. It is a test of character.
You may ask Lieutenant.
Phasers on stun. Move out.
As your teacher Mr. Spock is fond of saying I like to think there always are possibilities.
I reprogrammed the simulation so it was possible to rescue the ship.
At what.
Aye sir.
Understood sir.
Aye sir 
I am delighted any chance to go aboard Enterprise however briefly is always an excuse for nostalgia.
Engage warp engines 
Try again.
Battle stations.
Ill try Captain.
No power to the weapons system sir.
What did you expect Lieutenant?
Thank you Mr. Saavik.
Lieutenant the Admiral is aware of the Regulations.
By the book...
Spock. Does the good of the many outweigh the good of the one...?
Then you stand here alive because of a mistake  made by your flawed feeling human friends. They have sacrificed their futures because they believed that the good of the uoneu  you  was more important to them.
Bob... its tearing me apart.
I tried to clear things up Professor Scott. I explained youd come all the way from Edinburgh on appointment to study manufacturing methods here at Plexico but they dont seem to know anything about it.
Would you prefer to do nothing?
Lets hope so Bones. Mr. Sulu set us down in Golden Gate Park.
Pavel can you hear me? Give me your name and rank...
It would be impossible to discuss the subject without a common frame of reference.
Pardon me Doctor I am hearing many calls of distress.
I liked him better before he died.
Thats crazy Who would send a probe hundreds of light years to talk to a whale?
... Best shot...?
No Spock. It means he feels safer about your guesses than most other peoples facts.
Reading the patients vital signs.
How do you explain slowing pulse low respiratory rate and coma?
Fundoscopic examination is unrevealing in these cases
My God man drilling holes in his head is not the answer. The artery must be repaired without delay or he will die So put away your butcher knives and let me save the patient
Captain their call is being carried on an amplification wave of enormous power
It gives me a great sense of danger. We have to beam in next to the reactor room not in it.
No umyu name.
Mr. President the Probe has passed through all quadrants. The starships Shepard and Yorktown and three smaller vessels have been neutralized.
Communicate? Communicate what? You have no right to be here
Youre not one of those guys from the military are you? Trying to teach whales to retrieve torpedoes or some dipshit stuff like that?
To put it mildly. Since the dawn of time men have harvested whales for a variety of purposes most of which can be achieved synthetically at this point. A hundred years ago using handthrown harpoons they did plenty of damage  but that was nothing compared to what theyve achieved in this century.
How soon?
Youve already been that. Cmon.
In fact we may be able to help  in ways that frankly you couldnt possibly imagine.
Very likely. Youre not exactly catching us at our best.
Just lucky I guess.
Whats what?
Tell me when the whales are going to be released?
You asked.  Now will you tell me something?  George and Gracies transmitter. Whats the frequency?
Right.
Yes... And Im glad youre here. Though Ill admit you picked a hellova time to drop in...
Have I flipped out? ... Is any of this real?
What do I care? Ive got nobody but those whales...
Youre going to your ship Im going to mine. Science Vessel. Ive got 300 years of catchup learning to do.
Dont worry. Ill find uyouu.  See you around the galaxy...
The sounds but not the language. We would be responding in gibberish.
There is one but I cannot guarantee its success. We could attempt to find some Humpback Whales.
What are the variables...?
How do you know this...?
Admiral if we were to assume these. whales are ours to do with as we please we would be as guilty as those who caused their extinction.
The hell I cant
Admiral you must wait one damn minute.
Hardly Admiral I cannot even guarantee we will escape the Suns gravity I will attempt to compensate by altering our trajectory.
No data Admiral. Computers are nonfunctional.
Mr. Sulu we need breakaway speed
Hover on my mark Mr. Sulu Mr. Chekov stand by decloaking  Scotty ready for power build up  Mark Mr. Sulu...
Picture Uhura
Overlapping distress calls. Some from Starships... others...
From a city? That doesnt make sense....
On screen.
Give me one more day sir. The damage control is easy. Reading Klingon is hard.
About 60 feet Admiral.
I suppose I can sir are you planning to take a swim?
Not good enough Scotty. Youve got to do better
No power to the bay doors.
Scotty dont prejudge. A ship is a ship.
Dont concern yourself Saavik. Your leave has been granted for good and proper cause.  How are you feeling?
Yes Admiral.  Sir. I have not had the opportunity to tell you about your son.  David died most bravely. He saved Spock. He saved us all... I thought you should know.
Millions?
... Yes?
Gomen nasarei. Hito chigai de gozaranuka na.  Im sorry my son. You have mis taken me for someone else.
Your directive apparently doesnt include spying on other cultures.
Weve always known that to survive we had to remain apart. It hasnt been easy. Many of the young people here want to know more about the offland... theyre attracted to stories of a faster pace of life...
But not you.
... an offlander?
Ill be here.
The mighty Federation could learn a few things from this village...
Youre what?
I understand.
Perhaps that is true.
It is safer there. I will join you shortly.
The artificial lifeform was right?
Captain Geordi...?
What possible purpose could a duplicate village have except... to deceive the Baku...
I dont know.
I prefer to wait until we can share the benefits with all the people of the Federation...
Hes right. Our shields have been upgraded to protect against the environmental anomalies...
Talk... we should send down an assault team and take them by force.
Thats probably not a good idea. Your ship hasnt been fitted for this region there are environmental concerns...
This was too important for the Enterprise to be on the sidelines Admiral...
Understood.
... or understand that they were participating in the outright theft of a world.  I wont let you move them Admiral. Ill go to the Federation Council...
There are metaphasic particles all over The Briar Patch. Why must this planet be...
If a courtmartial is the only way to tell the people of the Federation what happened here then I welcome it.
Is this how a Federation officer begs for his life?
No sir. But it wasnt easy... being among them...
Sir as the Enterprise left orbit one of their support craft went down to the surface.  It appeared to be the Captains Yacht. Five persons on board.
May I talk to you alone?
No one hated them more than you Galna.  Weve come a long way together. This is the moment weve planned for so many years...
When I was an ensign I could detect a threemicron mis alignment...
The Sona reports claim they didnt fire until after he malfunctioned.
So youre saying he still knew the difference between right and wrong.
Its nothing. Im just tired.
Negative. I want to use the ramscoop to collect as much of it as we can...
On screen.
Cometary debris pockets of unstable metreon gas... we dont want to go in there sir...
We cant delay the archaeological expedition to Hanoran Two. It would put us into the middle of monsoon season...
We wont be able to go any faster than onethird impulse in that muck...
Were not going anywhere.
Aye sir.
No were here to... rescue them.
Were coming as fast as we can... we cant risk using phasers...
Its good to have you back Worf.  Slow to onethird. Take us in.
Sir?
Decloak the holoship and engage a tractor beam Mister Worf.
Better have the chef whip up a light balsamic vinaigrette... something that goes well with chrysanthemums...
Why was Data assigned?
What are they interested in...?
Was I doing something to your neck?
But its comfortable.
Or you could try lying down.
... Doctor Crusher has something thatll take care of that...
They must have been locked and secured after we were beamed here.
Absolutely.
Yes...
JeanLuc this man needs medical attention now.
How did Doctor Almack react to that?
You want some advice? Dont do this again.  You know exactly what I mean.
Id call them excuses. And the first excuse on both our lists was our sense of duty. We convinced ourselves that it was more important than anything else. And you know what? Its not.
Um... yeah.  Now hes going to need a respirator. Do you have one?
Theyre not your friends... theyve held you back... kept you from your destiny...
No... no please... you cannot...
What?
I am the Borg.
How serious is the damage?
There should be some kind of manual release...
It could be the radiation Captain. Try from the surface.
Always am.
UEngage.U
Were crossing the threshold
California. San Francisco.
Im an old friend of Cochranes... I wanted to see how he was doing.
The invasion plans.
Ah... yes... but I didnt realize that 
Yes... I wanted to ask you about some photographs I saw out at the silo. There were three of them... printed on some kind of fabric.
Fraid not.
Im sure it is. But itll have to wait until tomorrow.
Dont flatter yourself. I take pictures of a lot of junk.
Myself... and a few other friends of Zephrams.
Western hemisphere... North American continent...
They did it... they assimilated Earth.
Were still in Earth orbit.
Incoming message from the Starship Intrepid. Admiral Hayes.
Assign another team if you need to. I want to reestablish communication with the Captain as soon as possible.
Well have to assume theyve been assimilated into the Collective.
We have to cover both possibilities.  Well take care of the Bridge. Worf take your men and seal off Main Engineering. Turn it into a fortress  nothing gets in.
They appear to be modifying the deflector dish.
I guess Id better get it right the first time.
The Borg.  Some of them mustve beamed over before we destroyed their ship.  Seal off that entire deck with emergency force fields.
What are you suggesting?
Commander... we have a problem.
At present Im awaiting a full report from Enterprise. Pending that I am constrained to observe Interstellar Law.
We DO sleep lying down.
Thank you nurse. Jim shes ready Lock and load
We WERE beginning to hit our stride together doctor...
Whats the Brotherhood of Aliens?
Come on...
And the good news is theyre not going to prosecute.
Captain shall we attempt to return fire?
In space no one can hear you sweat.
Theyll make it look like an accident...
I dont mind. Smuggling. Guilty. I come from Arc. Smuggling is an ancient and respected trade there.
Thats a comfort...
I beg your pardon?
How can I trust 
He just tried to save him
Isnt it a fact that you served Romulan ale a beverage illegal in the Federation because of its overwhelming potency?
There... were no other ships in the sector.
That we fired two photon torpedoes. But 
Those words WERE spoken by me.
Captain Sulu... on assignment... anyone seen Spock?
Full diplomatic courtesy Mr. Chekov...
Torpedo bay DID we fire those torpedoes?
Who else?
But if shes cloaked...
Shields up. Battle stations.
Aye sir thrusters...
Now we go to Starfleet?
Mr. Valtane any more data?
Do we report this sir?
Uh would you and your party care to dine this evening aboard Enterprise with my officers as guests of the United Federation of Planets?
Well make arrangements to have you beamed aboard at 1930 hours.
Commander face to face at last.. you have my thanks..
Except us.
Energize...
Saavik sir. We were told youd need a helmsman   ... so I volunteered.
Plot a course for Kronos Lieutenant.
Uhura signal our surrender.
I wont allow Starfleet to be dismantled over some Klingon promises.
Sulu
Curiously it appears to emanate from us.
He was just about to explain the whole damn 
What peace conference?
You were right it was arrogant presumption that got us into this situation. You might have died.
Probably trying to figure out why were reversing wondering if we detect her.
Control this is Enterprise requesting permission to depart.
This is the Starship Enterprise Captain James Kirk commanding.
Who else?
Sir I speak to you as a kindred intellect. Do you not recognize that a turning point has been reached in the affairs of the Federation?
Faith...?
In the meantime we must endeavor to piece together what happened here tonight. According to our data banks this ship fired those torpedoes.
Such things have happened before sir.
I dont want to.
Youve betrayed the Federation  all of you.
Signal Starfleet that... we have no idea location of Enterprise.
Well have to check every one of them Mr. Scott.
Then someone forged a data bank entry.
This one can.
Yes sir.
Hes placing himself in a most awkward position...
I was taken from my homeworld by people called the PakJeds. They are fat. They traded me to a ship belonging to the Bolians. The Bolians are blue. They put me in a seat and asked me questions. Then they were attacked by another ship...
No.
Because you are dangerous.
You have been programmed to gather information that can be used against this ship.
No.
No. Can I move now?
For how long?
Understood. Keep on it. I need to know what he has and how to neutralize any threat. Give me options.
Is he very much like you were?
It would appear so.
Well find a way off together. Recommendations?
Port thrusters sir. Would you like me to drive?
Its interfering with our uplink from Starfleet cartography?
You are not looking at your self. You are looking at me.
Captain I dont recommend transporting that ion storm doesnt look very neighborly. It could head this way with out much warning .
An individual more like you you mean.
Maybe hes not supposed to be like you. Maybe hes supposed to be just like he is.
Emergency force fields are holding.

The resemblance is... striking.
I would like to pick you up now. May I do that?
The least I could do for you Deanna.  Besides you know me... Im a talking head.
As much as we care for him Deanna... we have to remember that Data isnt capable of disappointment.
How could I not?
Permission denied. If you can possibly endure any more of these assaults.  I need you at my side. Now more than ever I...
I know how he thinks.
Your timing is impeccable Commander.
When this is over I owe you a drink.
What do we know about the planet?
Which is why our initial scans didnt pick it up. But hes got it Captain.
Aye sir.
Sir we wont be able to bring you back. Its a one way trip. Captain I dont know if the transporter...
Just lucky Admiral.
If you dont mind.
Your new chair sir.
Still well on our side...
Thank you sir...
I appreciate your concern Number One but Ive been itching to try out the Argo.
Counselor?
And the Romulans invade.
Shes the most beautiful ship Ive ever seen.
When your first officer insists that you cant go on away missions... Ignore him.
Praetor Shinzon. Were not here to discuss your lack of a social life.
I know.
Youll acquire a taste for it.
Youre doing this to liberate the Remans?
Theres so much and so much of it is dull...
No. I was the first Picard to leave Earth.  It caused quite a stir In fact. But I had spent my whole life...
I always hoped I would hit two meters.
Youre not Reman.
We are.
So if I gave you my life what would you do with it? Would you spend the years in a blaze of hatred as you are now? Or could you change? Could you try to remember a mothers touch you never felt? A fathers words you never heard? Could you do that?
Please.
It is... invigorating.
Find her again.
She is here.
None.
I came this far alone ...
You dont have to understand.
Silence Romulan
I dont want to scare them away.
How much are your rooms?
Ill have to run your card off now.
Its still the full price.
We should have. Let me see.
I understand.
Get the body out of there. Load it on the Air Force chopper and get it to Wright Patterson. Theyll take it from there... We didnt expect this Shermin.
Its in a green Mustang?
Dammit Shermin. Earlier you were asking for help. Whats changed?
We dont know what else to do. We need results.
Ill make this as simple as I can George. They disappeared.
George listen to what youre saying. This things changed itself into a man. Disappearing may not be that big a deal.
You just do your job Shermin. Well make the policy.
Shermin...
We have a new directive. Im taking over.
What?
Shermin Shermin
Marc Shermin.
Do you know what you were kidnapped by?
What.
Ah no.
Eh... police.
Good.
Smile.
Its closed... closed. We need one thats open.
Not what. Who. What is for things.  What? What? What? What? For people you use who. Who is he?  Who is she?  Who are you?  Who am I?
Space?
Shit?
You better.
I do not understand.
Yes.
No.
Why?
Thats easy. Ill explain that in a minute. This is your ticket. When you get on the bus here the driver will take this part. You will ride to Omaha. When you get to Omaha ask the driver. Salt Lake City please. I do not speak English.
Las Vegas please. I do not speak English. What is hitchhike?
Tomorrow morning. Start hitchhiking right away and...
I am your friend.
Why?
Im not sleepy anymore. Lets drive for a little while longer.
I cant stay on this planet.
You can stop. I will go on alone.
I cant be late. I dont know if the radio balloons work above your planet. I dont know if my words went to the ship. If Im not there the captain will think Im dead and go.
Youre damn right I am.
Nothing.
Do they talk?
I understand.
I gave you a baby last night.
Yes.
Many of my people will not believe those things are possible. On my planet there is only one government one people one language. I will be asked a lot of questions.
I will say that we can be friends.
Many many days and nights...
Thank you Jennyhaydn. You are good. I must go alone now.
Call the police
Hey she doesnt want to go with you. Come on.
In the cars too?
Its easier not to tell if you dont know.
I wouldnt worry about it... There might not be any little league tomorrow.
Any reports about monsters people in Halloween masks anything like that?
It was only an accident that we discovered them.
Yes.
Las Vegas please. I do not speak English.
I dont understand.
Huh?... Eh... no there isnt
I wouldnt think so.
If I talk to you I will miss my ship.
Okay cash  Logical.  Heres everything I have on me what do you say?  How about a Rolex?
No problem.
Youre too goddamned paranoid.
A tragic story no doubt.  Howd you get up here?
Maybe now you appreciate the danger were in.  It was touching the way you stood by me in there.  Stand by your man. I was moved.  You were very good.  I dont think he even understands that you did it for him.
I know.  Lenny if Tran finds you talking to me hell hurt you.
What?  He gonna record you on his label?
Max Pelcher?  Youre kidding?
Cant do it.
Iris is dead.  She was murdered.
Dont know.  But this guys real damaged goods.  Iris knew someone was after her... and she said you were in danger too.  Now no more games Faith.  Whatever youre hiding whatevers going on you have to get out of here now. Come with me right now.  Dont even think about it.
Okay.  It was funny.  But it cost me money.
Shutup a second
Not now... I dont want to think about it
Im on her amigo.  No worries. Gotta jam.
I intend to.
Wheres Faith?
And who was regrettably also your best fucking friend.
Well you couldve at least warned me.  You know I hate the zap... when they die.  It just brings down your whole day.  Jeez Tick.
Yeah when did that start?  Come on man  Its what people want to see and you know it.
Ha  Thats for fucking sure.
Wait wait... wait a minute.  Iris was here?
She never gave me a tape.
Faith can I talk to you a second?
They jerked my wheels dyou believe it?  I mean its outrageous the computer errors the banks are making lately.  Have you noticed?
Mace  Youre a lifesaver.
Coming with you.
No see a friend is more than one person constantly doing favors for another.  You just suck people along with your schemes and your scams and your slick act.  Well Im out.  I got a kid I got rent I got an ex husband someplace who doesnt send me a dime of support... Im just trying to hold on here.
Lenny youre turning into some kinda squidhead lowlife.  Youre always broke you just go from one score to the next.  And youre getting strung out... you dont even see it.  Getting high on your own supply like some crack dealer.
Go to the Sunset Sheraton.  RIGHT NOW  Just go  GO
Snuff clip.  It was Iris.  She said she needed my help and I... aw Jesus Mace... the sick fucker killed her.
Ive never dealt in blackjacks. Never.  Everybody knows that.
So some psycho wirefreak gets to keep running around
Okay so hes a freak who thinks hes sane pretending to be a freak. The point is he was a hitter. Somebody wanted to shut her up.  But why not just put a little lead in her ear?
Now youre really getting paranoid.
OK.  He asks about you all the time. Its been weeks since youve seen him.
Easy there Mom.  Easy.  This is audio only.  John Coltrane.  A Love Supreme. Give it a listen let me know what you think maybe you wont go for it now but itll get in your head and grow like a seed into something really beautiful.
Its in my case.  Okay?  Im going to open my case...
Take it easy.  The glass is bullet resistant.
You sure?
Well look at the plus side.
Yeah.  You gave up your hot tub tape to save me.  Thats real progress for you.
Yeah right blow it open.
Lenny... shutup.  Just park your mouth and listen.  Its a setup. Think about it  Whys he been sending you tapes?  To freak you get you to rush in without thinking. Then they put one in you put one in her put the gun in your hand... crime of passion.  This guys bent enough to think of that.
You never told me.
No its not.
No.  They must have sent it to my beach house by mistake.
Uh unh.
And do what?  Take on his whole posse?
See you downtown.
Aw Mom
Take the tape to the cops.
Um... he was older.
The bearded guy the creep. Oh one other thing. Testa if thats his name he kept mentioning my feet. Said I had very pretty feet.
Just mopping up. Nine bodies in all.
No sir.
Mack this is Sheriff Dylan.
Whats the bad news?
Tape it off well want to finetooth comb it. My guess is that the UNSUB is having us on. He checks in pays picks up the key but never walks inside. Tell me if Im wrong.
I want to talk about the Karen Sumpter case.
Shes buried.
We need to run this through VICAP search for similar burns.
This is Agent Mackelway.
Not a discrepancy an error. My capacity is 5.5 tons not 6.
Its been customized for sleeping capacity.
Sorry. Ive seen you in here. Always lugging that case around.  Whatja sell?
You must travel a lot huh?
Whole country or just hereabouts?
About your being away all the time. Must get lonely.
Why me? What do you want from me?
What are you doing?
Just step outside sir. Now. Keep your hands where I can see them.
This better be important.
Then why do I still have a badge?
You suspected all along suspected he was alive. Thats why you came to El Paso.
How long ago?
An oversight sir I apologize. I felt I needed to get away for a day. The pressure. Paid for my own ticket.
I need to get to Amarillo immediately.
I cant. The chat room isnt open for another five days.
Theres a killer out there  we know who he is. He could be stalking now.
Suspect Zero now theres an idea that doesnt look good on paper 
They sort of got me on shit detail no offense.
The Academy then CIIAC.
This is no random killing no one shot deal. The UNSUB has killed before hes good at it. So what do we have?  We have someone who has killed before who kills someone who kills a serial killer of a serial killer  and who wants the FBI to know he exists.
It explains a lot.
The man knew how to dress.
I was going to be a physician I am a physician but I kept drifting over to criminal psych. This seems to be the best of both. My parents still havent forgiven me.
Sex.
Grown man dressed like a clown. Does he really think he looks good?
I was thinking maybe we should ask Professor Daitz. Nobody knows this stuff better.
I know.
Does Koessler ask about me?
What did you tell him?
No Jaime I apologize. I didnt... I had no right to speak to you like that.
You did.
Not the way I can.
Jaime? Where are you?
I guess Im a little paranoid.
Koessler doesnt know any of this?
Its too late for that. Ive gone ahead of the curve on this one. Theres no turning back. When this is over Koessler is going to be right or Low is going to be right or Im going to be right but not all of us.
Could be a lot of things. Depends on the freezer.  Im sorry Mack but I dont think this is the answer.
Hardly anyone calls me Tom. Everybody calls me Mack. I always liked that.
Yeah of course.
How are we going to find him?
No weapon.
Ill be back.
I believe it is you sir who has us jumping through hoops.
Im not sure exactly. I had monsters on the brain. I wanted to get these guys every one of them. I got obsessive.
Deputy Director Koessler opposed the theory because it meant pressing the legal envelope risking highprofile failure. Better to get rid of me. Then he could be Mr. Serial Killer Mr. Authority on Deviant Behavior  no embarrassing questions about the contribution of one Richard Low. Do you really think that plane crashed by accident? Do you really think I wasnt on it by accident? Ive always had a good sense of intuition.
Zero killed them all?
Whatever happened to MyDick?
Something came up Murman my man.
Lead the way Murman.
Lets go someplace private Murman I have something for you.
You tell me.
And I want to go back to Needlepoint.
I dont think so. We want the same thing. See ya.
What did you do to end up here?
Sounds like fun.
I wished to be reinstated at Computer Crimes. I was undiplomatic in my request.
This case has sent bells and alarms ringing all the way to Washington. Your old boss is coming out.
He wants us to know hes out there what hes doing. Its not enough just to kill somebody like Speck he wants us to know he did it.
What is it exactly I dont understand Agent Mackelway?
I know I know.
Enough. Ive got to use the phone.
What do you drive?
I know Starbucks I served you an espresso at Starbucks.
Yes Remember? You asked me for an application? I introduced you to the manager?
Yes. Like the quiche.
I thought real men dont like quiche.
What else...? Lets see... You have complete freedom.
Uh if the guy wants to.
No man. I know you didnt get it cause you wouldntve asked me. It wasnt that funny anyway...
...and even then...
What an asshole.
Dont worry. Hes in good hands.
I believe it too. He really just wants her to be happy.
No thanks. Why ruin a perfect night.
Uh I dont want to bet it all.
There are different circuits... its hard to explain... you wouldnt understand...
Actually its funny you... Im actually uh between...
I know but she did. Shes with someone else now...
We were a rebound and we lasted six years.
If and when I get a real gig Ill call you.
...The red piece of shit over there...
...get the hell outta here already...
Hi Mike?
...Six months.
Yeah?
What kind of things?
I thought you met someone else.

What do you want? Youre tall.
Well until now. Tend the pin.
I shouldnt Mike its a weeknight.
I dont know. Eight or Nine.
Whatd you get?
Looks like were in a dead heat after one hole. This is turning into quite a rivalry.
Classy.
Bud.
I know. Its like the opposite of inbreeding. The hottest one percent from around the world migrate to this gene pool.
Ah theres the rub...
...A Boy Named Sue. I think thats why hes such a bad cat.
Because you left man. Shes got her own world to deal with in New York. She was a sweet girl but fuck her. You gotta move on. You gotta let go of the past. The future is so beautiful. Every day is so sunny out here. Its like Manifest Destiny man. I mean we made it. Whats past is prologue. That which does not kill us makes us stronger. All that shit. Youll get over it.
Sometimes is still hurts. You know how it is man. I mean each day you think about it less and less. And then one day you wake up and you dont think of it at all and you almost miss that feeling. Its kinda weird. You miss the pain because it was part of your life for so long. And the boom something reminds you of her and you just smile that bittersweet smile.
You always know the right thing to say.
So what? Eleven?
...People get carjacked...
...Whatever. Youre like a whining little woman. Big deal. You got a fuckin number. Whoopee Youll fuck it up...
Hi Nikki. This is Mike. I met you tonight at the Dresden. I uh just called to say I uh Im really glad we met and you should give me a call. So call me tomorrow or like in two days whatever. My number is 213 5554679... 
I just got out of a sixyear relationship. Okay? That should help to explain why Im acting so weird. Its not you. Its me. I just wanted to say that. Sorry.  This is Mike. 
Hang on Voltaire.
I know. Daddys gonna get the Rainman suite. Vegas baby. Were going to Vegas
Whu?
Baby there are beautiful babies here.
She smiled baby.
Im telling you they love that shit.
What? You think shes gonna tell her pitboss on us?
Im just saying not in this particular case.
Yea how much?
Lets go.
That was money. Tell me that wasnt money.
Leave? The honeybabys bringing us some cocktails.
Baby did you hear her? You shouldnt leave without getting something for free. She wants to party baby.
Its not. Youre money. Any of these ladies would be lucky to pull a cat like you.
...gotta...
What?
You didnt have to get into it baby.
I didnt even like her to be honest.
Baby youre so money you dont even know it.
Michelle went for you right.
Baby shes the one who should be thinking about you. Sounds to me like you cut loose some dead weight. Trust me Mikey youre better off.
Aww... He got away?
It starts at eight...
I dont know. It was kind of a dick move if you ask me.
No baby
A day.
Oh. Hes got it under control...
...Its on.
No Shes not looking at you. She hasnt looked at you once. Will you stop asking if... Wait she just looked.
True.
Youre like this big bear with claws and fangs...
Now go over there and get those digits.
Listen. Just because I was the only one with the balls to stand up to them...
Have you gotten laid once since you moved here? Did you fuck once?
...its on.
...its definitely on.
Yeah. You probably coulda hit that tonight if you didnt have to drive us home.
Two vodka martinis straight up shaken not stirred very dry easy on the water.
Yes. 
I ask for Justice.
America has been good to me...
Good.  From me youll get Justice.
Ba Fa Goulle.
No just you and Paulie.
You wont see Paulie anymore.  Hes sick for good this winter.
We gotta move...
Sure.
Drive while you thinking I wanna get to the City this month
OK go to Arthur Avenue Im suppose to call when I found somethin.
Maybe or you gotta know now.
Its too late.  All the contracts have been signed theyre almost ready to shoot.
You understand him better than anyone.
Mention it dont insist.  Barzini is a man who will know that without being told.
Tattaglia is a pimp.  He could never have outfought Santino.  But I wasnt sure until this day.  No it was Barzini all along.
Maybe I can help.
For bravery.
Ill need him.
Yes.
Tom what we need is an Act of Congress to allow Enzo to become a citizen.
Michael why must you do this.  We have been lucky so far all these months youve been here weve kept your name a secret.  It is from love for your father that Ive asked you never to more than an hour from the Villa.
Where are you going?
There is nothing there.  Not anymore.
Bad news from America.  Your brother Santino.  He has been killed.
Only the son of a Pezzonovanta.
Shhhhh.
You look good too.
Come here a minute Fredo.
Okay.  One minute.
The cops have it locked in and I got my people there visiting Pop all the time.  What about the hit list.
Without your fathers political contacts and personal influence the Corleone family loses half its strength.  Without your father the other New York families might wind up supporting Sollozzo and the Tattaglias just to make sure there isnt a long destructive war.  The old days are over this is 1946 nobody wants bloodshed anymore.  If your father dies...make the deal Sonny.
We put out a lot of material through our contacts in the Newspapers...about McCluskeys being tied up with Sollozzo in the Drug Rackets...things are starting to loosen up.
Mama no.
Thanks Tom.
Not so perfectly if you noticed.
Because they know that no Sicilian will refuse a request on his daughters wedding day.
Michael I love you.
How do you do.
My brother Sonny found him living in the streets when he was a kid so my father took him in.  Hes a good lawyer.
No.
My parents dont read the Daily News.  All right if you think I shouldnt.  I cant believe the things the papers are printing. Im sure most of its not true.
Im busy.
Dont ask me.
Jesus Christ hes my father Sonny.
Youre right kid Clemenza is okay. It was Paulie.
Thanks.
You took Freddie in because the Corleone family bankrolled your casino.  You and the Corleone family are evened out.  This is for business name your price.
You son of a bitch you think you can brush me off like that?  I made my bones when you were going out with cheerleaders.
Everybody should have one talent.  Whats yours?
Meet my father Herbert Richard Greenleaf 1st.
Marge Ripleys saying goodbye.
Did you speak to my father?
Stop Its too much Youre making all the hairs on my neck stand up
Marge Youve got to hear this
No I think your mother her illness 
What time is it?  Oh God Do you always type your letters?  That should be two Ts.
Sure. I love Venice.
A few places  thats a few jobs. Anyway I dont want to think about New York.
Pretty vile. See this The S and the T do you see?  fine vulnerable  thats pain thats secret pain.
No
I dont know Why are you asking me?  How can it take an hour to find an ambulance?
Did I know you at Princeton Tom? I didnt did I?
I knew it I had a bet with Marge
Do you even like jazz  or was that something for my benefit?
I love Marge.
What evening?
I dont think so. Come back with me to Rome. Theres this great new club. Have some drinks lotta ladies...
Far cry from New York.
Marge good morning. Unusual weather.
Hes being thorough thats all. Im learning about my son Tom now hes missing. Im learning a great deal about him. I hope you can fill in some more blanks for me. Marge has been good enough to do that about Mongibello.
I feel guilty. I feel like I pushed him away. I spoke and he heard you.
Can you bear it? We hear youre a friend of Freddies  he has I hate Opera tattooed on his chest.
Im sure weve met.
Mr Ripley? Im Alvin MacCarron.
Frances?
What does that mean?
Is that what he said  he wanted to be alone?
No.  Hello Im Tom Ripley.
Marge you know Dickie has I hate Opera tattooed on his chest.
Really? Thats swell. No I was just  youre way ahead of me Great
No well go if you want to but dont talk to the Police about my face  they find out he hit me  hes got a temper  he couldve hit Freddie.  Good luck Marge. Ill catch up with you later.
Dickie hasnt killed himself. Im sure of that. Theres a private detective on the case now  a Mr MacCarron  Dickies fathers employing him.
Hes having an early night.
Let me put on some clothes and then we can talk about this.
What are you going to do now Tom?
Marge I dont know you so I have no right but Dickie loves you. Hes  I think youll find hes coming home to you.
No glasses.
I dont know her.  He hasnt called hes hardly written just these cryptic notes. You dont just dump people.
Excuse me?
As in the...?
Randall.
What?
I thought you were enjoying yourself?
Youre crazy Its freezing out there.
Peter SmithKingsley? I havent seen him in months. No Im alone. 
But the point is Dickie  well we know this  Dickie loves Marge and he misses her and apparently hes come to his senses...
Dont be daft. Its fine. Im delighted you finally made it to Venice. Im delighted contrary to rumour youre still in one piece?
What do you mean? Theyre sending someone from Rome?
Whatever you do however terrible however hurtful  it all makes sense doesnt it? Inside your head. You never meet anybody who thinks theyre a bad person or that theyre cruel.
You look ghastly Tom. Are you okay?
Its okay.
All kinds of things. Making plans.
I dont know. Both. My plan right now is to go up on deck look at the sunset. Come with me.
Peter I... I...
You have the key. Tell me some good things about Tom Ripley. Dont get up. Just tell me some nice things.
Postmortem?
Of course. What happened to your face?
Even your fiance...?
May I ask... why would you speak to your friend and not your fiance?
I want a .32. Revolver. And a palm gun. That .22 there.
You cant carry in a cab even with a permit  so why bother?
Sure here take this card go to this place and give em the card. Theyll charge you but there wont be any hassle.
Yes mam.
Its just to the corner mam. In broad daytime. Nothing can happen. Ill be there to protect you.
I know what you mean. Ive got the same problems. I just cant get things organized. Little things I mean. Like my room my possessions. I should get one of those signs that says One of these days Im gonna get organezizied
I can believe that.
Oh uptown. You know. Some joint. It aint much.
I had a regular job for a while days. You know doin this doin that. But I didnt have anything to do at night. I got kinda lonely you know just wandering around. So I decided to works nights. It aint good to be alone you know.
I shut the meter off for one thing. I knew I wasnt going to get paid. Then I dropped him off at the cop shop. They took him.
Oh you see lots of freaky stuff in a cab. Especially when the moons out.
No. It was you. You had some manila folders and a pink bag from Saks.
Well no... not really... had some famous people in the cab.  I got this guy who makes lasers. Not regular lasers not the big kind. Little lasers pocket sized small enough to clip your belt like a transistor radio like a gun you know. Like a ray gun. Zap.
I work a single which means theres no replacement  no second man on the cab. Six to six sometimes eight. Seventytwo hours a week.
Sometimes 76 or 80. Sometimes I squeeze a few more hours in the morning. Eighty miles a day a hundred miles a night.
What?
Im no pusher Betsy. Honest. I never have pushed.
Yeah. Yes. I dont follow music too much.
Yeah well my stereo player is broke. But Im sure the record is OK.
No.  I thought maybe you could play it for me on your player.
Oh I got over that. It was nothing really. The papers always blow these things up.  A little stiffness. Thatll go away. I just sleep more thats all.
Thank you Travis.
The senators white paper is almost ready Bets. Should we wait for that?
Have you been noticing anything strange?
Whys that taxi driver across the street been staring at us?
Im great. Always set my fingers on fire. If you want to see another trick. I do this thing with my nose.
You sure hes not Italian?
Dont be naive. They cant kill everybody. They have different punishments for different things. Like if they kill a stool pigeon they leave a canary on the body. Its symbolic.
I dont know. Maybe they dont leave a canary. Dont be technical. What Im saying is if this newsstand guys Italian and his fingers are gone maybe hes a thief.
Show me how he did that again.
Awh come off it Pal.
What did you do?
OneBall McCall?
And the kid says Yeah. Shes about 19 goodlookin. McCall says What can I tell you?
No just some crazy fucker. Cut half his ear off.
In the jungle. 122nd.
All right.  You see that guy over there?  His name is Sport. Go talk to him. Ill wait here.
I dont like my real name.
Why should I want to get out of here? This is where I live.
Oh come off it man.
I can leave anytime I want.
Thats not hard to do.
Sure. All right. Well have breakfast. I get up about one oclock. Tomorrow.
Why do you want me to go back to my parents? They hate me. Why do you think I split? There aint nothin there.
I dont know. Just should though.  Somebody should kill em. Nobodyd miss em.
Im sorry Iris. I didnt mean that.
I cant. Otherwise I would.
Thank you sir. Youre a good man sir.
No Sir.
We hire a lot of moonlighters here.
Well then check back tomorrow.
Why do you ask?
Great hey. Thanks a lot.
Im no cop.  I want some action.
Shit.
Well if you are its entrapment already.
Funny you dont look hip. 
Thats just about the dumbest thing I ever heard Wizard.
Yeah. Sorry Wizard.
Okay.  How bout Carla Goodspeed?  Six years Bill.  Weve lived together six years.
Youre not wimping out on us Goodspeed.

Its all I could think of.
Its about time.
Partners.
Whats that?  Mason?
Oh yes.  Yes he was.
Come on Delly look at the country today.  Were fighting communists in Korea were paranoid about the Russians weve got this thing with the Rosenbergs and the atomic bomb...  You think they want suspected communists entertaining the American public with party propaganda like gosh I dont know Sand Pirates of the Sahara?
I am too.
I wish you were coming with me.
Maybe we could train Cat to run the projector.  You know a system of scratching posts and gears and levers...
Mr. Chairman as I understand it the Fifth Amendment pertains to selfincrimination and I cant incriminate myself because Ive done nothing wrong.  Besides incrimination is why you have Mr. Clyde working for you.
That always used to work.
You mean  me?
Ive seen you before.  Your picture...
You look... different.
Howd they get it inside?
Actually I was married.  For four years.  But... well we didnt fit together.  Im divorced now.
Oh...
What?
Yeah and needless to say none of us has that kind of money lying around.
Have you got a cigarette?
I dont smoke?
Oh.
You had a hidden agenda though. See when he was five or six little Spence used to follow you around like a puppy.  Bothered the hell out of you.  But as soon as you gave him the clarinet...
Nope.  Just filling in the blanks.
Mr. Appleton do you know an Albert Lucas Trumbo?
Good.  Good.  Now I hold in my hand a photostatic copy of the attendance roster for the Bread Instead of Bullets Club of the University of California Los Angeles dated October 11 1935.  A copy of this paper is before you Mr. Appleton. Do you recognize it?
Mr. Appleton please tell this committee what was the nature and purpose of the Bread Instead of Bullets Club?
Start with what you knew then.
Im not refuting anything.
I do.
I... I need a drink of water.
Whats that?
Thanks.
Cant wait.
Oh.  What... what time is it?
You two have a lot of catching up to do I guess.
Theyre...
Oh no I...
Dad I...
Sixthirty.  I thought wed get an early start.
Youre not going anywhere Harry.
Pete if J. Edgar Hoover walked in here wearing a dress I wouldnt know him.
You should watch what you say.  You dont know whos listening.
Pete...
No sir.
Call me... Ishmael?
Whats his rent?
At least I was on our side  Look they want me to testify?  Ill testify.  Ill tell em anything they want to hear  Jesus Leo this is my career
Yeah well thats enough.
What do you mean?
Thanks.
Oh...
Actually my grandpap.  But ancestors sounds better dont it?  Here.
You look familiar fella.  Whats your name?
Well Id really hope to rent it for...
No its not the cut thats bothering me.
Afraid of any woman whod give Mitch the only thing Lydia can give him  love.
No I dont think so. Shes not afraid of losing her son you see.  Shes only afraid of being abandoned.
So it ended. Not immediately of course. I went back to San Francisco and I still saw Mitch every now and then... but we both knew it was finished.
Then you know. Little girls in brown beanies. Deadly. Here I have a life. Ill go into that classroom on Monday morning and Ill look out at twenty five upturned little faces and each of them will be saying Yes please give me what you have.  And Ill give them what I have. I havent got very much but Ill give them every ounce of it. To me thats very important. It makes me want to stay alive for a long long time.  Thats the first reason.
I wanted to be near Mitch.  It was over and I knew it but I wanted to be near him anyway.  You see I still like him a hell of a lot. Thats rare I think. I dont want to lose his friendship... ever.
In a democracy Cathy everyone is entitled to a fair trial. Your brothers practice...
Just listen to them
I dont think your mother would like that.
I dont know yet.
I guess it does get a little hectic at times.
She said something about having to get home to take a call from her mother back East.
Take it into the living room would you hon?
That road can be a bad one at night Melanie. 
Shhh. Shhhhh.
Thats where the Brenners live.
Follow the road straight through town til it curves off on the left. Thatll take you right around the bay to their front door.
Yep.  Could save yourself a lot of trouble. Her names Alice for sure.
Its nothing.
Birds are not bad
No. ...came down on one of my boats. They could have been after the fish just as you said.
I had to acknowledge a delivery.  Mother Id like you to meet...
Miss Daniels is staying for the weekend. In fact Ive already invited her to dinner tonight.
Im simply quoting the law.
I told you. We met yesterday.
No. I only led her into believing I believed she was... Mother its really very complicated.
I know Mother.
Mother?
I think I can handle Melanie Daniels by myself.
Oh my God look at her
Youre doing fine.
Where can we go Mitch? Theres no place to go.
Im frightened terribly frightened. I... I dont know whats out there Mitch.
Yeah and the freeways welllighted isnt it Mitch?
I keep seeing Dan Fawcetts face.  They have such big windows at the school.  All the windows were broken. In Dans bedroom. All the windows.
Yes.
Is that so important Mrs. Brenner? You liking me?
I dont mind really.
We know what it is Al.
Well use smoke pots. Like the Army uses.
Yes.
Bodega Bay. He goes up there every weekend.
These are for my sister... her birthday you see. As shell be eleven and... well frankly I wouldnt want a pair of birds that were too demonstrative.
As the same time I wouldnt want birds that were aloof either.
The sign says strawberry finches.
Those are canaries Miss.  Doesnt this make you feel awful?
I imagine thats very important. Especially during the moulting season.
How can you tell?
Ahhh but I really do want those birds.
Yes.
I cant say I like your seagulls much either. I come all the way up here to...
Then its settled. What time is dinner Mother?
Of course how stupid of me. A quarter to seven will that be all right?
San Franciscos a long way from here.
Im neither poor nor innocent but the truth of that particular...
I wrote the letter.
It said Dear Mr. Brenner I think you need those lovebirds after all. They may help your personality. Thats what it said.
Yes.
Cheers.
What do you do?
Im glad you do.
A gull smashed into Annies front door.  Mitch... whats happening?
Its hard to believe anything at all happened yesterday isnt it? Its so beautiful and still now.  I think Ive got it all figured out by the way.
At Annies house. Shes all right.
It... it doesnt look very different does it? A little smoke over the town but otherwise...
Inland.
Maybe.
I thought theyd have stopped by now.
Mitch...
You said three oclock.
Well this one wont be a chick will he?
I think maybe youd better deliver him. Let me give you my address. 
Do you have any lovebirds?
Daniels. I think they were after the children.
I thought not. Birds have been on this planet since archaeopteryx Miss Daniels a hundred and twenty million years ago
No one called it a war
I have seen jays doing everything it is conceivable for jays to do. Ornithology happens to be my avocation Miss Daniels. Youre talking about preservation of the species a hen protecting her young. Theres a vast difference between...
No one ever said you were Mitch.
Im not sure but...
Georgina told me how kind you were to her.  It gave me hope you might intercede for us with Dr. MacFarlane.
Yes.
Good morning Mr. Fettes.
But thats long since.  Gray cant threaten him with that.
MacFarlane
Where can I find him?
From the Municipal Council  theyre the bodies of paupers 
Not if I have to be party to things like that Dr. MacFarlane.
Youre a man of the world Fettes you wouldnt hold me to promise given in drink.
Look here Fettes.  Not I nor anyone else knows enough about the spinal column and its intricacies to insure success in such an operation.  I would have to study the matter.  Have we any subjects?
Grave robbing is one thing  this is murder.
Wait Doctor  wait  The childs fainting.
He has his own idea of a joke. Perhaps his horse tickled him in the ribs.
A burial party  poor people  its hard to bury a loved one on a rainy day when the churchyard is so cold and lonely.
It was a woman when we put her in.
He was a nice horse.
Dont call me that confounded name.
Medicine?  Thatll keep.  Sit down.
Afraid of what?
I am the best man for the job.
Youre uncommon friendly tonight Toddy. More like the old days.
The nerve centers  the brain 
Because it would be a hurt to me to see you no more Toddy. Youre a pleasure to me.
I know 
We could do that. But when he had them there then what?
Ill show you how it was done Joseph.  Ill show you how they Burked them.
No Doctor.  She seemed to get better then about six months later she began to complain of pain in her back 
You can get out.
Ill get him.
Tell her... well get him.
You said you saw me with this. I never held it until today.
Theres no scar. Corvis made it up.
The scar.
How can you die if youre already dead?
And another one. There. Erlich. Took a wrong turn.
Im not hiding. Im right here.
... is that I sent them here. I told them she came here sometimes. With her dirtball boyfriend. Thats exactly what I said.
Yes I do I really do.
My father.
Its not. I cant take it.
I know.
Some hooker phoned it in. There was a riot at his apartment yesterday.
Good for you. You do know something.
Could say that.
She was eighteen years old There were four of them. They stabbed her fifty three times Wheres the fucking accident? Huh? Where is it?
I want you... to bend over.
Erin. I know you think shes been talking to you.
The cop who found the knife in Corviss car.
He said hed prove it.
Looks like you have them both on.
Its not what you think.
Erin. It wasnt supposed to happen.
About you.
My name is Klaatu.  I spent two days at your Walter Reed Hospital. Room 309. My doctors name was Major White  and I had a very attractive nurse called Ruth whos getting married next Wednesday.  If you are not interested  or if you intend to turn me over to your Army  we neednt waste any more time.
We scientists understand this. Even we primitive scientists.  What exactly is the nature of your mission Mr. Klaatu?
I come to you as a last resort  and I confess that my patience is wearing thin.  Must I take drastic action in order to get a hearing?
I assure you such power exists.
Hello darling.  Good evening Mr. Carpenter.
Gee why Mom? Hes my best friend... And hes awful good in arithmetic. He even helps Professor Barnhardt.
No dear of course not. Hes a very nice man. I Just think he might prefer to be left alone. Now you get to bed and forget about it.  Night darling.
No I havent Mom. I promise you... I saw it
No  Im afraid not.
He lives here in Washington doesnt he?
Where is that?
Yes  I think so.
Gee How could they make a landing?
I dont know Bobby. Im inclined to doubt it.
Velocity is the time rate of change of position.
Its a problem in celestial mechanics.
All right.
Why not Bobby?
Well finish it tomorrow... Goodnight Bobby.
Thanks Mr. Carpenter.
Yeah  sure.  Its a real Boy Scout flashlight.
Why  the light in my room went out.  Thank you Bobby. Goodnight.
Their life expectancy is a hundred and thirty.
He says their medicine is that much more advanced.  He was very nice about it. But he made me feel like a thirdclass witch doctor.
Im afraid in the present situation youll have to learn to think that way.
This is not a personal matter Mr. Harley. It concerns all the people on your planet.
I traveled 250 million miles. What about your United Nations?
Under the circumstances Im afraid that will be impossible.
Theres always somebody here but today of course theyve all got plans.
I  Im afraid I cant  not right now. Can I talk to you later?. Yes thatll be fine. Bye.
All right Tom  its true. I know its true.
I dont care about the rest of the world
Goodnight Mr. Carpenter.
Where is the meeting going to be?
How long will I live?  That no one can say.
Hell catch on to it in no time now.
No  Im afraid not.
They would have killed this man?
How long will that take?
Get going will you Brady  before I get mad
We dont ride with vampires.
El Vampiro.
Ive only got one question for you and I want an honest answer.  Have you taken any human victims yet?
We unraveled in the face of the enemy
Why?  Theyre only noodles.

Look at your reflection in the mirror
I dont know Michael.  This is not like breaking a lamp or getting a D.
I dont know.
And the horse you rode in on. Sixteen for how long?  You cant predict this time of year...
I just cant comprehend any of this. It was just a dog.
If the weather clears enough before we reach anybody  Im sending you and Doc up to MacMurdo...
Nobodys getting in here.  You can tell them all that
I dont know who to trust.
Now whod go and do...
Let go of me...
Was dark... find a light...
Im working it  Nothings happening
Clark you want me to come in after you?
Look Im just guessing...
I just cant believe this voodoo bullshit.  You believe this voodoo bullshit Blair?
Thats good enough.
But...
What for?
I think so.
Im a real light sleeper Childs...
Nothing we can do about that.
And if it got to Clark... Clark could have gotten to anybody.
Well stick to it.
No.
Damn if I wont.
Thought youd feel that way Garry. You were the only one who could have gotten to that blood plasma...  ... well do you last...
Blair.  Hes gone berserk.
Itll come.  It needs us.  Were the only thing left to imitate...  Give me a hand.
Couldnt be possible.  Must have weighted a ton and a half...
Bullshit  Hes got to know damn well I cut it
The generator
So what do you make of it?
Who else could have used that key?
Hear what?
Cant hear you.
Dont tell me youre a mud carrier.
Were not supposed to think about it.  But I dream about it sometimes...
I am called Vox...  ... Now you are Eloi.
Can you show us where they live?
What?
It was meant to.
This way.
The Morlocks didnt build this.
End...?
Yes.  Initiative and daring are not desirable traits in the Eloi.  But you should be happy for her.  She wont remember the creature she was.  She will... become.
A man can change his history.
I  what are you?
Got here as soon as I could.
I mean... well... affection.
And what do you propose Professor? Shall we hold a seminar to study the problem?
I need... to talk to you.
Not here... alone.  Please.
No... lets walk through the city.
Shhh.  Lets just hurry on here. We dont have to talk all right?
The sailors omen of good fortune. The hunter watching over him on his travels.
Ive seen it.
Let them.
Tonights the night?
I want my students to emerge with theoretical and practical knowledge.
Thats how I knew we were destined to be together.  When I met her parents for the first time I came right from class and I was covered in chalk.  They sniffed and snorted but she just smiled.  At that moment  I just knew.  How did you know with Molly?
Youre dying here.  Dont you see that?
I dont understand.
Yes...
Mm.
Youre not from beyond the valley.
Allowed me to travel from my time to yours.
Just a dream.  You should sleep too.  Youre still not well.
You can see so many here.
And you saw a shape ahead of you...
Thank you.
You lost someone.
Mara...?
Ouch  all right wish me luck.
Tell him to go away 
May I get you some 
Exactly correct sir.
No Dr. Hartdegen they are not just chickens and roosters.  They are science.  Perhaps they arent inspiring to you.  Perhaps they dont challenge you 
Abstract mathematics relativity of dimensions geometrical durations  even allowing for the uses of speculation what is the point?
I took a different route.
New Yorkers.
Thats quite enough Kalen.
I am.  Are you a climber?
Theyre here  Theyre inside the house  
Must be all the exercise I get scampering up and down these stairs like a wee lamb.
For our sake I hope not.
Should we be what? Trying to change him any way we can? Beat Yes.
Depends on what youre seeing.
In where?
That wasnt a fucking restraint.
Dont give me that. I know whats real goddamnit You strapped me in something and stuck me in a drawer.
I had a patient a few years ago. His name was Ted Casey...
My business?
You in here. Beat Works like a drug.
I think you know. Your eyes say you do.
I didnt kill myself. I died from a blow to the head. Howd it happen? I have to know.
No we were patients.
He didnt either.
I wish theyd skip the formality of this annual review and just cut our budget. Our silence on the matter should be enough to appease the civic conscience without wasting an hour we dont have.
I am. One of the few things I remember doing is eating. So I guess I must be exercising it off in my dreams.
His body was found on January 1 1993 but do you know if that was long after he had died?
Mom this is the guy that drove us home that afternoon we were stuck on the highway. The guy you yelled at for no good reason...
Yeah but I dont know what.
Hey can you reach the gas pedal?
William Starks. Beat Thanks.
What? Now youre gonna show me some kind of drivers license?
I dont know. But he did die. STARKS falters under the news. JACKIE looks around through her now blurred eyes like she might find some help in the apartment. She settles for the BOTTLE of VODKA on the table lowers the iron fork and takes a long heavy drink then laughs nervously as she looks up.
Yeah.
What?
No. They never figured it out. I did. Most murderers dont stop to help a drunk woman and her little girl on the side of the road. Not without hurting them.
Me neither. Who was the boy she was talking about Eugene?
Lets see if they have an address for Becker. I also want to figure out more about the kid you helped her with.
Here drink this. Ill get the heat going.
Theyre not.
Therere no cars on this street.
Beat I dont know.
William youre not making sense.
No he didnt.
Because your body can only take so much of what theyre putting you through.
Youre bleeding pretty bad there.
Its complicated but looking at Starks in a way your father let me know how Id get through to him.
I see youve done your homework. Beat Alpine Groves undergone a lot of changes since then. At the time we didnt have the...resources to help our patients the way we needed to. Beat Now we do. And things are different.
I was working with a boy named Eugene.
How do you know about Dr. Becker?
Then help me understand. You know youre not alone. A lot of Gulf Vets have begun to experience curious symptoms. What you have might well be a syndrome and if so its not one we know enough about to be treating it this vigorously.
It doesnt look all that different.
I dont know how you know about Eugene but these ideas are part of your delusions.
You still dont believe me do you?
Who told you this?
Yeah guess so. Howd you know?
Or just plain stupid. Youd think by the twentieth time Id have found an alternative method. Maybe a more effective one if you know what I mean.
Gravely No I mean in four days Im supposed to die.
I doubt it. Beat I dont think prisons so bad you dont want to remember it...
Sure.
Well dont you somewhere? Stuff? Belongings?
Nothing. Getting up Thanks for bringing me this far.
Ill manage.
You remember it?
May be easy to remember but not easy to get. Being warm maybe  but look you dont even have a coat and I still have to chop wood to make a fire. Beat And being happy...you tell me if thats simple.
What.
No Thelma I dont give a shit what we have for dinner.  I may not even make it home for dinner.  You know how Fridays are.
Yes baby?
I could shoot your cousin Eddie.
I dont know honey.  I guess it would depend.
In the leg.
Has anybody asked his wife?  Shes the one I hope did it.
Youre still with us though.  Youre somewhere on the face of the earth?
Would you believe me if I told you this whole thing is an accident?
Is there any reason to believe theyve left the state?
Its him.
A .38.
Hes got nothin to gain by lyin.  Nothin at all.  He already got all their money.  I just dont know what were dealin with here. Anyway it went out again last night on Nationwide Teletype.  Lets just wait it out a little longer.  She said she was gonna call back.  Lets just sit tight.
Its okay.  He is an asshole.  Most of the time I just let it slide.
Thelma?  Its me.
Wait...  Um where ya going?
I dont know.  Nothin.  Took a shower.
Im a robber.
Oh my God  Jimmy  You... Oh my God  What are you doin here?
Why now Jimmy?
Damn Jimmy did you take a pill that makes you say all the right stuff?
You mean you havent asked him yet? For Christ sake Thelma is he your husband or your father?  Its just two days.  For Gods sake Thelma. Dont be a child.  Just tell him youre goin with me for cryin out loud.  Tell him Im havin a nervous breakdown.
Okay.  I will too.
How come he let you go?
Aw shit Thelma hes gonna kill you.
Isnt this fun?
Tell me somethin.  Is this my vacation or isnt it?  I mean God youre as bad as Darryl.
Yeah
Givin him a taste of his own medicine.  Asshole.
I wonder if Jimmys gotten back.
Get the car.
Tell them what?  What Thelma? What do you think we should tell them?
Only about a hundred people saw you cheek to goddamn cheek with him all night Thelma  Whos gonna believe that?  We just dont live in that kind of world.  Pull over
So this is all my fault is it.
What?  Oh I dont know.  Let me look.
Well when you figure it out wake me up.
Why are you actin like this?
Oklahoma City.  Jimmys gonna wire me some money and then...
Ive been tellin you that for the last ten years.
I dont want to go that way.  Find a way that we dont have to go through Texas.
Nothing.  Im not gonna tell him a thing.  The least I can do is not make him an accessory any more than he already is.
Nothing.  It got messed up.
Lemme see the map.
Oooooweee  You shoulda seen me Like Id been doin it all my life Nobody would ever believe it.
Try to.
Yeah.
Youre right.
Yeah.
Yeah.  Those.  That always put the fear of God in me.  What about you?
Harlan.
About how fast was I going?
I believe you.
Just asking.
Its good.  Its what the pioneers ate.
That guy was hurtin me.  And if you hadnt come out when you did hed a hurt me a lot worse.  And probably nothin woulda happened to him. Cause everybody did see me dancin with him all night.  And they woulda made out like I asked for it.  And my life woulda been ruined a whole lot worse than it is now.  At least now Im havin fun.  And Im not sorry the son of a bitch is dead. Im only sorry that it was you that did it and not me.  And if I havent I wanna take this time to thank you Louise.  Thank you for savin my ass.
No Louise you said the first part. I said all the rest.
But I dont know... somethings crossed over in me and I cant go back.  I mean I just couldnt live...
You could call it that.  My eyes are open.
We can change our names.
Youre drivin.
Its him.  Hes got California plates.  Its the same guy.
Yeah right.  Were not gonna get caught.
Oh.
You too sweetie the best.
How do you stay so positive?
Where?
Go?
Yeah.  I been seein you too.
You got that right.
Grrrreat
Fresno.
The things kind of heavy.
No I just meant...
Jeez I didnt catch it.
You sent that?
Woogie I caught you redhanded.
Stop that No Somebody help me
Never?
I dont know.
I did try calling her.  A few years ago. She wasnt listed.
They told me they dont help out stalkers.  Look maybe theyre right its been a long time.
Relax this guy owes me a big one. A couple years ago he got in a jam up in the Boston office some bullshit about padding his resume  like we havent all done that. Anyway they were going to let him go but his mother wrote a tearjerker letter that ended up on my desk.
Jesus Ted youve got to finish that damn novel so you can quit that stupid magazine.
Car clean? Plenty of gas?
Pipes? What are you talking about?
Im usually too tired to be.
But but youre married. You have kids a great wife.
Out getting coffee.
Big guy  goes to Barrington high school.
That right?
Aw Christ I cant take it anymore. Im gonna pack my bags and go back to my own place.
Nah some guy threw me a few bucks to track down his high school girlfriend.
Im doing okay.  I gotta get ready for work.
What can I tell you? Its a healthier lifestyle down here and its easier to succeed when your heads clear. Those guys I worked with back in Boston they were a bad influence.
You found my car?
Ah I got a date tonight with that Mary girl I told you about.
Dumbshit.
You own a home there?
Same here again.
Some buildings Im working on.
That sounds like fun.
Wow Ive never seen him like this. He doesnt usually like guys.
Great.
We will but first I have a surprise.
What say we get outta here and go crush a bucket?
That...? Vestibule.
When you look at architecture try not to concern yourself with the pieces  look at the building in its totalitarianism.
Magda? Shes not my grandmother  actually she rents the apartment right next to mine. Her husband passed away a couple years ago so she doesnt like to be alone.
Yeah I think its that dog of hers running around on the rug all day  just makes for a lot of lint. Look at this...
Have you seen it?
Well Ill see ya.
What?
Not to worry. So... see you tonight right? Right?
Well I know youre busy...
Look lets forget it. Lets forget the whole thing.
You get fifty a day period. Its a business trip theyll pay for your expenses.
So she hasnt changed?
Huh?
Its just that... Mary. I wouldnt have thought...
Yeah this insurance business is too slow for me. Im going to go down and try my hand at jai alai.
Rollerpig? Are you nuts?
Fetched a pretty penny too. Dont forget its the Sumo culture they pay by the pound there. Sort of like tuna.
I dont know what youre talking about.
Kim and I are close friends
You mean him.
Oh look its Doob Will you excuse me a minute Tucker?
Who?
But... but you knew people at Harvard.
Future wife? Get real man  youre nothing more than a glorified brother in her eyes.
Bingo. Especially since we guarantee youll get every bit as good a work out.
Whats that supposed to mean?
I dont want someone wholl put up with him. I want someone who will enjoy him the way I do. Do you know what he told my friend Tucker? He said he wouldve popped the question a lot earlier if Warren wasnt in my life.  Well he is in my life and Im goddamn lucky to have him. The hell with Steve.
These aint strangers theyre neighbors. This only picks up signals in a halfmile radius.
Hes no Steve Young.
Puffy get over here.
The little shit lied to me about that guy
Well thats what Im trying to figure out. How long have you known him?
Dont get all gooey on me now youll give me a big head.  The important thing Doctor is youve got to distance yourself as much as possible without pissing this psycho off.
Hes dead.
Oh... are you... ?
Thanks.
I mean he murdered someone and did time back in Boston. The guys a freak.
Well lucky for me I found out. Thank God I have friends like Tucker.  Look Im sick of talking about stalkers.  Lets talk about you.
No short game.
What are you?
I like it. And think of the toppings  cheese mushrooms mint jelly
Look Mary the truth is... Ill be in town for a while now but I dont think we should see each other for a few weeks.
You forgot your keys
Um hi Im Ted Peloquin. Im here to take Mary to the prom.
I think a little of both.
How the helld you get the beans all the way up top like that?
No thats really unneces 
Giddyup.
Were concerned about the possibility of an incident with an innocent cargo carrier. If it turns ugly the Russians could use an ugly incident and bad world opinion as leverage to force us to remove the quarantine.
With all due respect Mr. Secretary we were not firing on the ship. Firing on a ship means attacking the ship. We were not attacking the ship. We were firing over it.
Yes sir.
Yes.
So if there are alternatives that make sense  and Im not saying there are  we need em. Need em fast.
Tonight listening to Taylor and Acheson I kept seeing Burke and Dulles telling me all I had to do was sign on the dotted line. The invasion would succeed. Castro would be gone. Just like that. Easy.
Were split down the middle. If I held a vote I think airstrike would beat blockade by a vote or two.
Weve got bigger problems right now.
McNamaras on his way back here now. We need to pick the right ship. No subs. No armed boarding parties either. We need a little more time to figure this one out.
Hes right. And things are happening too fast. It smells like the Bay of Pigs all over again.
Something your father wouldve come up with.
 Jesus Mary and Joseph. I told you how stupid it was to float the Lippman article But you wouldnt listen to me. What if there hasnt been a coup at all? What if its you two who invited that second letter by raising the possibility of a trade?
No Ken. I need to see him now...
 You listen to me. Nobody nobody talks about my friends that way. Youre fucking here right now because of the Kennedys. They may be wrong. They make mistakes. But theyre not weak. The weak ones are these people who cant speak their own minds.
Weve just begun the mobilization under cover of a prearranged exercise sir. Were looking at another week and a half Mr. President.
Still heading for Cuba.
Understood sir. We need to step up the overflights finalize our pilots target folders in order to be able to carry out the strikes.
He was.
Well you know how Bobby has it in for the State of Mississippi.
Today for your information is Pulaski Day. Were going to Buffalo...
Zorin must not have gotten instructions. Somebody in their Foreign Ministrys blown it bigtime.
Youre sure...
Okay Ken. Were going.
Of course it is. But the President needs to realize were going to have to stop a ship eventually.
Listen to me goddamn it. Were talking about a possible nuclear war. You dropped the ball on Bay of Pigs 
And if this is a move to appease the hard line then it may just be the bone he needs to regain control of his own house.
Why else would they approach us in this way? Its deniable. The Soviets have done nothing but lie to us. This could be more of the same.
Weve worked up several military scenarios. Before I ask General Taylor to lead us through the various options Id like for us to adopt a rule. If we are going to strike we must agree now that we will do it before the missiles become operational. Because once they are I dont think we can guarantee getting them all before at least some are launched.
Mr. President Were receiving reports that the ships are stopping
Breathe Carl. Four nice deep ones.
Dont have one Carl. I have a number man. Just like the numbers on those treasury checks. You stole from your own country Carl. Shame on you.
Our police are afraid of them. Please get them out of here.
Hey Brooks come over here. I want you to meet a coupla fellas from Denver.
FBI? What you investigatin?
The only good Indian is a dead Indian does that old adage still hold true out here?
Leos been out here too long man. Im taking him to ceremonial burial.
No. No thats Ray here. Ray uh...  Ray... Little Weasel.
Good. Thank you.
Goodbye.
His mother needs a piece of his hair. Its for the Keeping of the Souls Ceremony.  Has to be kept for four days.
Airborne. Thats where they used to get us agents from. Now we get em from CarnegieMelon Ivy League. Accountants and computer whizkids. Yuppies with guns.  Thats scary shit.
I think Leos retired from quillwork for the moment.
She talks a lot of shit. Were not doing our job. Jimmys innocent. Whats the FBI really doing here. Some shit about the Fort Laramie Treaty.
Why we setting Eagle Bear up as an informant?
I just wanna make sure no one else gets done in that way because we were in bed with the wrong doer.
Thanks Cooch.
Well shes running now too. These fucking people like to run dont 
Yes.
Yeah. I... I fell asleep. I cant believe it. I 
We neutralized anybody with a voice. Leo Jimmy... Eagle Bear. Anyone who was standing in the way of the land. Is that it?
Youre steppin on sign.
Bullshit.
 his mother never lived here. She was from up in North Dakota.
Medicine. As in medicine man?
He wants to know if you ever watch the Cookie Monster. He says the Cookie Monster is not to be trusted  a trickster.
Go back to your DNA fingerprintin.
I see. Forgive my cultural ignorance.
You want solid? That one single print he left in the Badlands  the one the FBI missed and then stepped all over  it belongs to a man who walks heels first. Like a white man. Jimmy has a serious Indn walk  ball of the foot first. The man who murdered Leo walked like a Wasicu.
Go catch Jimmy Ray. Really. Hes gettin away. Go ahead go get him. Im late.
A what?
You aint no Indian. Youre a Sal Mineo Indian.
I cant Hoss. I dont talk to FBIs.
Crow Horse listen 
Nowhere. Im trying to find her.
Sorry.
Yeah. Fitful dreams.
Were standin on broken treaty ground Ray. This aint supposed to be here. Itll poison the water.
What we need... is Richard Yellow Bird.
I know. Come on. We gotta get off the reservation or were dead.
Washee is like... a dumpling. Like tallow we put in stew. I think he was calling you chubby boy.
Come back?
Yellow Bird committed suicide at three oclock this morning. Some gungho agent from D.C. pushed him into a corner. Youre playing a losing game. Pull over.
 yes Teton Sioux. Fathers side.
At Sioux Falls Pen?
I get thrown in solitary until I dont know my own fuckin name and then you people tell me I can beat nine years if I help you. I helped you
Uhhh...Anything I can do for you? She laughs again doesnt know what it is...could be chemical but shes instinctively attracted.
Save you from a big mistake with that other guy.
Its classified.
You know. The finger.
You know Im assigned to this school. I see sixteen new hotshots every eight weeks. Your attention is flattering but not really productive. Why dont you keep your mind on flying.
Im special.
Evan... or Maverick.

You dont believe any of this. You dont think youll ever die.
Why?
What do you want?
Hardly ever.
How does it go?
True.

Woods okay. I want Viper.
They should have warned you about that one.
Hes a hell of a flyer. In fact hes so damn good he might have been picked for Top Gun himself. Except for one thing.  He just cant seem to follow orders
Thats because you dont have any women.
SHIT

Howd you find me?
Thank you.
Definitely.
Get your story straight.  This idiots been trying to kill me since I went to Rekall.  You dont kill somebody youre trying to plant.

Sons of bitches
Naw dont want to winch it.  Thatd tear it all up.  Want to lift it. Some kind of crane with lifting straps.
First lets see if Stumpys still out there.

Just about too damn long.  Bolt patterns probably wrong anyway.
Doesnt matter.  The cat can pull uanyuthing.
You are so full of shit...
Ran into the new college student Rona.
Yeah.  One two three...
An hour after you picked it up
I know about Esparza.
Absolutely.
Let go of my hair.
Sustained.
I would like to put Shus alleged crime in a context your Honor. And we do have the foremost expert on prison and street gangs right here in this room... If it please the court Id like to call Mr. Reynard.
Im a lawyer. The firm is thinking about renovating. Everything dates back to the Sixties.
 I dont care who you are. You couldve been killed. Every man and woman in here has done hard prison time. And we look out for each other.
Shut your sewer mouth
I had a minute before the Mapp hearing  but I couldnt get you on the phone Eddie...
I can describe it.
I didnt take my eyes off it
Didnt this information come from the Joe Boys themselves  did they not all but hand you Shu Kai Kim a Korean an outsider?
No. No...
Of course.
Look  Im tired Ill see you in the morning Eddie.
Eight years ago. The Chinatown hit.
Saving it for the Sunday Times.
Roger Baron.
Thats why I hate experts.
You know how I know? Cause Reynard says hes guilty and Reynards full of shit Look 
Thats not gonna happen. Im gonna create reasonable doubt. Buckle your seatbelt and watch me work.
Im not that desperate.
Christ... Shu is innocent.
... An hour.  Thats why I thought the morgue was on the other side of town.
 Me? Neither.
Beats getting paid in twenties by slimedogs selling angel dust to high school seniors.
I didnt put him in a wheelchair. Reynard did. He can get around without one  its all in my report.
Eddie these things take time. Particularly at this hour...
How can I tell you what I dont know
When I joined up I took an oath of secrecy. I told you what you needed to know.
Seecil.
I always ttell the truth.  Thats why Im here.
Its in the area of narcotics Mr. Reynard that the government tramples on the Fourth Amendment.
Your client is guilty. Dont dick around with me.
Please dont bullshit me Mr. Reynard. Youve got witness problems youve got proof problems...
You know youre very tense Mr. Reynard. Youghta take a week off fly the wife and kids to Oahu.
Objection. The witness is not an expert in racial classification.
Objection.
And who was Arturo Esparza?
I didnt say he was an informant. But since you mentioned it wasnt Esparza your primary informant?
 Eddie told you?
Shouldnt one of us...?
 Why dont you ask Chuckie?
And its purpose?
Im a soldado in the GWing Regiment.
Shus the only one I know of...
No They ggot the wrong guy I saw it The killer wasnt Chinese.
Blonde.

Who are you? Who are you REALLY?
I want you to kill for me.
I want you to kill for me.
Here he comes.
Bobby... ssshhhh... you killed Mike.
Youre lucky I am not wasting you.
Weve got our own clock. Well lock up.

Teresa Banks had a ring. Any idea what happened to it?
Sam get the body and put it in the van.  Sheriff Cable where were you the night Teresa Banks was murdered?

COOPER MEET THE LONG LOST PHILLIP JEFFRIES. YOU MAY HAVE HEARD OF HIM AT THE ACADEMY.
Teresa Banks.
ALBERT WHY TYLENOL?
Sorry to hear it.
Did she ever mention any friends?
Did you ever see Teresa take cocaine?
Right which is probably why Lil was wearing a red wig meaning we are headed into a dangerous situation. Let me ask you something Stanley did you notice anything about the dress?

Accused. Not indicted. He resigned the firm. Divorced nineteen seventy. Galvin worked with Michael Morrissey until Morrissey retired in seventy eight. Since then hes been on his own. Four cases before the Circuit Court. He lost them all. He drinks.
All right. But lets keep the price down. Ive called Ed Concannon. He recommends that we continue to respond as if were going to trial.
Yes.
Because it struck me how neatly three went into the amount. Two Hundred Ten Thousand. That would mean I keep seventy.
Yes. It would be.
Youve just said you signed it.
After after the operation when that poor girl she went in a coma. Dr. Towler called me in. He told me he had five difficult deliveries in a row and he was tired and he never looked at the admittance form.  And he told me to change the form. He told me to change the one to a nine.

What did these people do when her heart stopped?
Yes.
I doubt well have to go to trial...
Hold on a second.
Now Dr. Towlers testified that they restored the heartbeat within three or four minutes. In your opinion is his estimate correct?
Well...
Her doctors murdered her. They gave her the wrong anesthetic and they put her in the hospital for life.  Her doctors murdered her.
I read the file. Yeah. Marx and Towler. I know who they were.
To do right. Isnt that why youre doing it?
Hi. How are you doing?
Yes.
My client cant walk your Honor.

We had rather more important things on our mind than taking notes.  We were trying to restore her...
Wait wait wait youre saying that her brain damage could have been caused by her being deprived of oxygen for two minutes...?
Huh. And why is that?
Huh.
Madrid has just blacked out Nothing more coming through.

I didnt know how to stop you...
Dont you live at home?
I come from a big one.  Nine of us. All in Minnesota except me.
It does...Maybe thats why I feel kind of lost right now.
But they seem to murder everything that moves...
I liked him.
But youre not going to.  Youre not the kind.  Youre tired anyway.  Youve been up all night.  You cracked up in a plane.  Slept in a ditch.  But you want to know something?  It doesnt show on you at all.
Hours.  Ive been so scared...
I couldnt see much in the dark  but it was one
Thats the kind of a kid brother youd have
Youll be all right with us....  ...for as long as anybodys got
It might give us something.
It was nearer than that.
Welcome to California
Believe it or not he told me I hadnt heard from him in ten years because he hasnt had any good nightmare.  Theyre his inspiration.  But now hes got a new script in the works.
Hes very excited about it.
What?
You get any sleep last night?
Okay but it still doesnt mean it cant be over with.
Maybe you should tell me your dream.

Its in my family you know.  My grandmother died in an institution...
Kids know when somethings bugging a parent.  Youve got no idea who this is calling?
Dylans run away from the hospital.  I dont know whether hes wandering around or heading for the house.  But I think Freddys after him.  I know it sounds crazy
John.  Will you please just look for him around the hospital?  Im gonna go right to the house.  Will you help me John?  Please
No you dont maam its not necessary.
Thanks.  Just give them the time he called.  Theyre keeping a list supposedly.  Sorry.  My nerves are so raw these days.
By storytellers of all things.  Every so often they imagine a story good enough to catch its essence.  Then its held prisoner for a while.  In the story.
Choice?  What kind of choice?
And how about your costar in NIGHTMARE I.  Would you trust him alone with your child?
Your father?
You miss him.
He never would have believed a woman like you existed.
Claiming their place in the world.
Hey  Weigh  Blow the man down...

My instinct was to not get electrocuted.
Butler whatd I ever do to you?
What do you mean?
No I cant.
What do you mean?
My old man split along time ago.  It doesnt mean anything.  You just take care of number one thats all that matters.
If youre gonna cheat you might as well copy off somebody whos gonna get the answer right.

Why are you here?
Look you put me on this boat in the first place.  I didnt want to come but I did.  Why do you have to embarrass me.  Why cant you just leave me alone?
Theyre in a hurry to grow up.  They dont know about consequences or responsibility.  Thats being sixteen too.  I promise you one thing...
Theyll know about it in the morning.
Shes Cuban.
Whyd you jump?
I couldnt do it.
Trust me donut.  I know.
On the dog watch night after the storm I look down into the skylight above Skippers cabin and there she was peelin down.

Outer.
No.
Excellent.  Bill find Mr. Weathers a position to suit his condition.
Im sorry...
Except a White Squall.  With all due respect Captain Sheldrake theyre only boys...

Muchas gracias.
Call me Johnnie... N.O. has always been a good town to sit around in.
Shes forgiven you of all these things... You love her... Dont be afraid Sailor.
Certainly not. We are here only briefly in fact until this evening when we fly to Austin Texas to visit a friend of mine who is an agent for the CIA.
Why not? How was the fishin?
Sorry sweetheart. Bein in love with you like I am brings out that ugly jealous side.
Sailor aint a murderer. You got to get off that kick. And fars I can tell Sailor was entire clean prior to that involvin Lula. Even there he was protectin her. You oughta be thankin him for that. That Bob Ray Lemon they say was comin after the both of em. Why am I tellin you this you was around that night. You ought to know just exactly what happened. Sailor just got a little too forceful is all... You remember that night...
This is the kinda mistake can take a Hindus lifetime to unfix... You better get a move on Johnnie before that boy got her holdin down a Memphis streetcorner and shootin dope up her arms.
No but my guess is theyre headed west so probly Texas. Their money must be runnin low. I dont think Sailor had much to begin with if any and Lula took the six hundred she had saved in the Cherokee Thrift.
Honey I have to ask you this... Is Santos involved in any of this?
That bastard Pucinski...
Howll he know what we look like? He seen our photo?
Like you sweetheart. You and your daddy got the same mouth eyes ears and nose. Only difference is your color hair is like mine.
And?
Peanut...
Grandmama Pace had a long smooth white neck. It was like on a statue it was so white?
Here she goes again...
Thats good... Now go get yourself a beer.  You fellas have alotta the same power Elvis had... Yall know this one?
Well like mama told me Aunt Rootie Dells mama? She found cockroaches in Dells underwear.
You up for that?
Thank the Lord. Well you aint let me down yet Sailor. Thats moren I can say for the rest of the world?
Thats disgustin. Those kinda sentiments shouldnt be allowed out in public. Is this Biloxi yet?
Got anyplace special in mind?
Looks more like the Ghost of the Old South but well try her.
There aint no water in the swimmin pool. Just a dead tree fell in probly from bein struck by lightnin.
Lula... I learned somethin interestin today on a science show I heard on the radio... How leeches is comin back into style.
Its just another case Sailor.
Shhhhh... Its four oclock... That womans laugh the other day had somethin to do with this feelin?... Like bein ripped apart by a gorilla maybe... Grabbed sudden and pulled apart real quick by a real powerful one.
I was hopin you would. I know that night by heart. Sometimes honey? I think its the best night of my life.
Hard to tell whats shakin in a place like this honey. You dont want to be walkin in the wrong door.
Well find out in a hurry.
Uh huh.
Mama. I been thinkin about her. Shes probly worried to death by now.
I want to call her and tell her Im okay. That were okay.
Leave me be for a minute? Mama gets all insane and then I see you practicin your individuality and personal freedom with some oiltown tramp. How you figure Im gonna feel?
Thatd be good Lula.
I cant take no more of this radio...  I aint never heard so much concentrated weirdness in my life Sailor Ripley you find me some dancin music right this minute... I MEAN IT
We all got a secret side baby. Hope you dont think I been lyin to you bout other things sugar.
My mama...  So Sailor our histories have been somewhat intertwined.
Well were really out in the middle of it now aint we?
Yeah?
I know you aint particularly pleased bein here.
Oughta make em happy.
Went with Bobby.
Were goin to Lula real soon.
We got about forty bucks sweetheart. Thatd get us to El Paso.
Argentina Lula youre outta your mind. Now you just tell me where you are and Ill come for you. I wont say nothin to the police about Sailor I promise. He can do what he wants I dont care.
Dont be crazy mama. Take care of yourself.
Got any plans?
What if I told you not to?
I want you to get rid of Sailor.
I dont need to explain anymoren I have... You know damn well.
Thats your business... I dont care how.
Santos...
Shoot him.
No.
No... But...
Santos... I cant...
...Yes you heard me... Dont ever call back here again.
So?
I didnt see nothin...
Thanks...
Excuse me. Did you or did you not have a gun to his head?
Oh dont be silly. No one your age just wants to go home. Besides faculty will be present. Just think of it as a field trip.
Were springing you Leer. Get some pants on.
The candelabras were my Grans.
Hes great. Come on lets blow before lo Gran decides to boil your bones for breakfast.
Hhhuh. So we decoy her. Stick a couple pillows and one of your teddy bears under the spread and she wont know the difference.
So I hear.
Ah right. Well I gave you my opinion.
I sweat blood for five years and he checks for spelling.
It was Jerry Nathans. He owed me money.
She left me. Crabs.
This morning. I found a note in the kitchen.
Shut up and drink.
Vernon then. Vernon Hardapple. The scars are from a  from a horse. He fell during a race and got trampled.
He cant piss standing up anymore.
And he had a younger brother who... was... a...
Because... because...
Tripp.
Where would we go?
What? Ohhhh. Is that... it?
Nothing hes just been sort of I dont know... kidnapped.
Yees?
Only now Im starting to think the car wasnt exactly Jerrys to give.
No wonder he screwed us over.
Ah. Well. Congratulations. Meanwhile what is James supposed to do? Pray for Walter Gaskell to come to his?
Thats very enlightened Professor. Its comforting to know that Americas children have you for a teacher.
I mean I was breaking up with this girl at the time and my car was ail fucked up and  well  I was pretty bent in general.
I just want you to know thats why I dropped your class and said all that shit about the university stealing my money and you being a pseudo Faulknerian nobody.
So I hear. Youve also been smoking a lot of marijuana I understand.
Her dog yes.
Theyre anxiety attacks? Thats a little disappointing.
Fraid so.
A little.
Heaven?
Like the lady herself.
She is. Ah. Here we go...
No thanks. Im fine without them.
Youre welcome.
I guess theres probably a story behind that.
Whatd he say?
Wow Hannah always swore you were working but 
Nothing its just that well its been awhile since Arsonists Daughter and some people  some of the kids in workshop  thought maybe you were...
Well done James.
I never heard of it.
Kinship.
I know. Its the house you want to wake up in on Christmas morning.  Make yourself at home. Ill be right back.
I never said that.
Spells? Jesus James you make it sound like were in a Tennessee Williams play. I dont have spells.
James like it or not theyre your parents.
Thats why she hates me. Thats why she makes me sleep in the basement.
Yes James.
Do?
At first the police thought he just ran away but this afternoon Dr. Gaskell found some blood spots on the carpet 
I told you Sewickly Heights.
That good huh?
I got the message you called too.
No. Maybe. I dont know. I dont know what Im going to do.
I guess youre going to have to chew it off then.
No. Theres no way. I mean dont you think theres no way?
A twelveyearold policeman came by the house this morning.
Hub? Oh well thats part of what I need to...
Im sort of helping him work through some issues.
I tried to call but apparently theres something wrong...
I think I might have.
I think I mightve said I was in love with you.
Oh?
I told Walter.
It didnt come up.
In the hospital. I was kind of excited about it at the time but then I was on pretty heavy painkillers.
Tony. Now that Im home.
Its Grady Walter.
I have... eightfifteen. Thats not right is it?
Christ Traxler. How the hell should I know?
Only when Im working.
As a heart attack.
Well Im sure with the proper guidance hell be fine.
Give me a break Grady.
Seems like the whole worlds gotten younger.
K through sixth.
Its a nice table.
It wasnt like that.
Next week? The week after?
Isnt it?
You dont have to tell me this.
Birds.
In that birch tree is a nest.
Me? Nah. Im more of a people watcher.
Not yet.
Got something to hide?
I could get a search warrant.
They grow outside dont they?
Yeah MaryKay I think I do. Thanks a bunch for the advice.
Would you like to sit on my lap?
They sound like finches.
Do you like it when he asks you?
Ms. Kramer.
Your daddy will always love you.
Im not running for Mr. Popularity.
That was a joke.
Diaries have sent too many guys to prison.
Of course.
I dont need someone else.
If Im not then what the hell am I doing here?
You know why. Its part of the parole deal.
We have a lot of work to do.
I couldnt say.
Then go see a therapist who will tell you youre normal
I want to talk about it now.
Sorry.
Just lying there.  Were taking a nap.
I was six years old
Are you okay?
I like the noise.
I get that impression.
Youre still here.
Maybe later.
I suffer from insomnia.
When I do sleep I sweat a lot. Usually I get nightmares and wake up screaming.
The worst?
Twelve years in prison is no joke.
You dont really 
No. Thats what I used to tell myself.
Well most people are stupid.  You want to talk about odds? One day Ill tell you how I survived as the youngest in a family of three sons. You wanna talk about odds?
Whats it look like?
Nothing.
Piece of cake baby.
What is that?  You drop your dive light?
Figured I was dead there when I seen that angel comin toward me.
Not even when it meant something.  Is that One Night up in Flatbed?
Wow youre right  Us poor dumb ol boys mightve had to think for ourselves.  Coulda been a disaster.
Not particularly.  Jeez look where this is set Morons.
I dont know.  Divorce aint final.  Forgot to take it off.
Yeah whatshisname wouldnt like it.  The Suit.
Bud why are you doing this?  Its not part of you life any more.
I dont know what I saw.  Okay?  Coffey wants to call it a Russian submersible fine.  Its a Russian submersible.  No problem.
If you say so.  It could be anything.
Its trying to communicate.
Theyll come out after us.
How?
Aaargh  Im freezing
NO  Now be logical Bud youre
Whats the plan?
Tell me later.
Course is worked.  Youre never wrong are you? How dyou feel.
Check.  Then I just hang with these guys right?
Yeah.  The dudes in bad shape... you see his hands?
Got it. Over.
Its his mixture  Too much oxygen
Couldnt stay away.  You running mixture for us? Good.  Couldnt ask for better.
Happy as hogs in a waller down there probly.
Turn it up bozo.
Weve been fully briefed Mrs. Brigman.
Gimme a break  Coffey these things live three and a half miles down on the bottom of an abyssal trench  Trust me... theyre not speaking Russian.
He couldnt be that dumb.  The guys a trained killer.  Buds idea of a fight is armwrestling One Night over laundry duty.
Very good.  About one person in twenty just cant handle it.  They go buggo.  Theyre no way to predict whos susceptible so stay alert.
Hes hallucinating badly.
To the fact of my retirement not only as a diplomat but also as a father.
You already know what they are.
Its the same thing. Goodbye dear.
Im sorry sir. I didnt mean to put it that way. But you must understand sir that I...
It takes about twenty to twentytwo hours for the current to reach here from Lisca Bianca.
Well what?
All I said was that it sounds like a good idea.
No.
But then when will we see each other?
But just think  the very same things you had said to her who knows how many times... maybe even just before we left while I was waiting outside your place...
And why did you drop them?
Im sure youd be able to design some very lovely things.
What Get married?
And arent you pleased?... That way youll have a new kind of adventure.
Why?
Sleep is something one must learn to overcome. I learned how to do it when I was a child. I never slept. And I had friends who even slept less than I did. The one who went to bed first paid a penalty. And we really didnt do anything. After seeing a movie wed go to a cafe and discuss things for a while... then wed sit down on a bench somewhere... listen to some drunkard... watch them putting up posters or manifestoes...or look at the sheep passing by... or go for a stroll around the market place... Or else wed go and wake up some girl in the neighborhood by standing in front of her window and calling out her name...
It was futile. We went all over.
I imagine he must be inside sleeping.
But whats gotten into you?... We would have known. Sandro must be out in the garden somewhere taking a breath of fresh air or watching the break of dawn. It would be a lovely surprise indeed if he turned out to be the sentimental type.
Yes youre right. Im sick and tired of being like that.
But for what reason should I come there?
But why?... What if it starts to rain?
So... the boat we saw yesterday afternoon might have also been that of these smugglers. Could it be possible then that Anna...?
This is Claudia Annas friend...  Youve never met my husband have you?
What is it?
And you expect to find him in here? Go and ask Claudia.
Giulia dont you understand that the more involved you become with people the more difficult it is to speak with them?
Here I am.
And where do you find the models?
I thought the model was something obsolete nowadays. Didnt you Claudia?
Yes sir. My sister is sick... and my father too.
Now look my men saw it and they also saw you men throwing those crates overboard. What have you got to say about that?
I tell you this acquaintance of mine knows you and she has often spoken to me about you.
At this time of the year there are so many boats...
I dont see why I should mind.
Good. Then Ill meet you there.
I detest it. But after all what can you do... Its the latest...and I try my best to adapt myself.
If womens breasts were colored yours would be blue...
Who?
... You neednt worry about being attractive here.
Agnes dear Heaven is not a place where...
They were stained.
I dont know. I dont know what happened Mother I woke up... there was blood on the sheets but I dont know what happened.  I dont know what I did wrong I dont know and I should be punished.
I love you.
At least once a week.
Do you remember the night they said it came?
And what did you do?
In the middle of all the pain?
The baby they made up.
Agnes...
I cant have them any more.
Smoking is an obsession with me. Maybe one day Ill become obsessed with something else then Ill stop smoking... Do you have any more questions?
She was kind to me. She told me I was beautiful.
She said all of Gods angels would want to sleep beside me if they could. I liked that.
Somebody told her.
Youll laugh.
No.
No but I can never tell her that.
Because I dont want one.
A mistake...
Im not sick.
I cant.
Yes.
She touches me down there with a cigarette.  Please Mommy dont touch me like that any more. Ill be good  I wont be a baby any more.
No Im not.
But its easy. Its just a breath with sound. Say it. What kind of trouble?
May I open my eyes now?
I ate.
Of me. Oh... God  My God...  Water... its all water...
What did she mean?
Who?
He frightened you and he hurt you. Its not your fault. Its his fault. Tell us who he is so we can find him. Stop him from doing this to other women.
Agnes?  Who?  Mother Superior?
Why?
And the sooner she goes to prison the better off shell be?
Thanks...
You got to be crazy.
If I find anything Ill call you.
Tomorrow... tomorrow Ill get it by tomorrow. I will.
Shut up Im trying to watch this.
Noone.
Were examined once a year. Her pregnancy fell in between the doctors visits.
Obviously there was.
How could she have a baby and know nothing of sex or birth?
If shes so innocent how come she murdered a child?
So someone else could have done it.
One of the other nuns found out about the baby and... and wanted to avoid a scandal.
Well its been known to happen in the day too. Maybe Agnes went to him.
And what happened?
But she didnt... did she. If anyone had seen what Id seen shed be public property... newspapermen psychiatrists ridicule. She doesnt deserve that.
I havent said anything against the the Catholic Church.
And she has a right to know that theres a world out there filled with people who dont believe in God...  ... and arent any worse off than you Mother. People whove gone through their entire lives without bending their knees once to anybody. And people who fall in love and have babies and occas sionally are very happy. She has a right to know that. But you and your... your order and your Church have kept her ignorant...
Theres another choice.
Nothing.
Yes.
What is it?
I never saw Agnes until she set foot in this convent. My sister ran away from home. We lost touch with her. And when my husband died and I came here she wrote to me and asked me if I would take care of Agnes in case anything happened.
Nothing...
Hand rolled.
For the Church?
How  ?
Youll never find the answer for everything God did.
Thats what you believe she is?  The sum of her psychological parts?
Why do you insist upon pressing...
I didnt guess until it was too late.
... Oh Im all heart Maam all heart ... Well I let ...
Shurrup
Well thats lovely talk that is. And another thing why arent you at school?
Yeah? And theyre your mates are they?
How about Ding Dong?
And hurry theyre not looking too happy.
Well thats the wrong line for a start.
Youve got an inferiority complex you have.
Ill have a bash.
I dont care.
Oh you mean that posh bird who gets everything wrong?
It is yknow.
No straight up.
Hes sulking again.
We do.
He hasnt.
Ill look in here again.
Oh sorry I spoke.
Dyou know something They dont worry me at all. Anyroad I only fancy listening to you ... thats all but if it worries you ... well ...
Yeah ... I mean sure well I took it at school but I only ever heard boys and masters saying those lines like sounds different on a girl.  Yeah its gear on a girl.
Dont mench ... well why dont you give us a few more lines like?
No.  Im a walkon in a fancy dress scene. I just felt like doing those lines.
The big hammer?
What of? Look I wouldnt do it unless I was. Im dead lucky cos I get paid for doing something I love doing.
I only enjoy acting for myself. I hate it when other people are let in.
And you honestly think thats what she meant?
See you.
Yeah ... whats in it for me?
Im going parading before its too late
Nothing good.
Get Lloyd George over there with that mechanic in the cloth cap while I sort this lot out.
Before you go I think its only fair to warn you about me Grandson ... dont let our Paul have his own way all the time cos if you do he wont respect you
Youre lefthanded arent you Paul?
Aye come on honest that grandfather of yours is worse than any of you lot.
Shurrup Look Mister weve paid for our seats too you know.
Nothing hes trying to brainwash me and give me personality doubts ... oh hes a swine but a clever swine mind.

Bulbs burned out nobody bothered to replace em.
All over the ship well have to check the charts to know for sure.

Hows Broussard?

Sounds like a rough one.
Im trying.
The computer just translated the goddamn message.  Its not an S.O.S. It was a warning.
Jay this is Cleave  Meet me at the main air lock
It doesnt make any sense.  It paralyzes him... puts him into a coma... then keeps him alive.
I think its fizzled out.
Hey  what about the film?
Ive got an idea but youre not going to like it.
Sun will be down in a minute.
Maybe we should just wait a few more minutes.
Primitive pictorial languages are based on common objects in the environment and this can be used as a starting point for translation...
All right then  when it gets to the other side of the door you sing out then drop the door.  Okay?
Look 
Chaz Ive got something here on my security alert.  A high priority from the computer...
Turn on navigation lights.
Nontoxic... but unbreathable. Pressure?
Good  Moisture content?
Oh well... you know me.
Good.
You bet we made it.  Martin set course for Irth and accelerate us into stardrive.
I guess we open the door and net it.
Once we kill the thing we wont need the food any more  we can go straight into hypersleep.  Also it sounds like that thing is already doing a pretty good job on our supplies it may be fouling them all.
Go ahead Jay.
At least were rid of the damn monster.  It must have been the first thing sucked out of the ship.
Doesnt matter  were already at light speed.  And when we get back to the Colonies theyll pick us up in the network.
Its stable it doesnt hurt to drop it.
What can I do?
Sure.
Well just keep looking.  Its gotta be... whoa Jesus
Bloody big if it is.  Tops open.
Thanks.
Oh man...
Better tell the boss.
Too many.
Keep trying
Shit.  When?
We ran a trajectory simulation.  If they carry on along that path its possible theyll make intraorbital insertion.
Seven minutes ago the third course change in an hour.  Those incomings are going to skim past the communications platform just a little too close for comfort.
Match it
Thats what I mean.  This is the quietest Ive ever heard it.  Its unnatural.
Ive seen this mother De Vries.  We can bag it no problem.
Yeah I...
Its alright its cool...
Where does that lead to?
Whats the problem?
Give me twenty minutes and Ill do it myself.
Have you got an updated Lloyds Almanac to crossreff them through?
Get off an allbands emergency distress and put it on a repeater.
Compensate
What?  Why?
Forget it.  I wouldnt ask somebody to do something I wouldnt do myself.  Wheres the disk?
Right.  Autoshop you all set?
I just... wanted to be put on my own for a while.  Clear my head.
And before that?
We?  You wanna fly out there with me?
Check out the tent.
Alright.  Pull some trackers and headsets out of stores and Ill sign a release for the weapons.  Cassie organise a team roster and put it on the board.
Detour.  Other ways blocked...
Dont wait for me
I... I cant
No
You should hit the sack too.
Give me a yell is something happens.
I call myself Phoebe.
Im not enough for a paragraph.
It wasnt meant to be.
Max is paying for it. He and Lloyd had a terrific row but Lloyd insisted... well. Can I fix you a drink?
Im in love with Lloyd
... and Karen.
We sat and talked Addison. I want a run of the play contract.
Everything. Because after tonight you will belong to me.
What of it?
She never proved anything not a thing
I was there I saw you and heard you through the dressing room door
Yes Addison.
Now theres something a girl could make sacrifices for.
You have me confused with Dan Dailey. You go sit by the piano.  And you come sit by me.  Good night.
Why do they always look like unhappy rabbits?
Thats all television is my dear. Nothing but auditions.
As soon as the peasants stop pawing her.
Its new Margo. But shes just as late as the old one.
Miss Caswell at the moment is where I can lend no support  moral or otherwise.
Completely. Nor I am sure could anyone else present tell you how Miss Caswell read or whether Miss Caswell read or rode a pogo stick.
How nice for Lloyd. And how nice for Eve. How nice for everybody.
The air lines have clocks even if you havent I start shooting a week from Monday  Zanuck is impatient he wants me he needs me
Geniuses dont need good luck.  I do.
Thank you so much.
Im a junk yard.
Real diamonds in a wig. The world we live in...
Huh?
A big hurry be quick about it  so good night darling and sleep tight...
Sing it?
I get a party dont I?
She hasnt missed a week since I left  but you know all that you probably tell her what to write... anyway I sent her a list of people to ask  check with her.
How is Eve? Okay?
See you...
Shes a girl of so many interests.
So youve pointed out so often. So many qualities so often. Her loyalty efficiency devotion warmth affection  and so young. So young and so fair...
It hasnt been laid out we havent finished with the embalming. As a matter of fact youre looking at it. The remains of Margo Channing. Sitting up. It is my last wish to be buried sitting up.
So full of meaning fire and music
Ive been aware of that for some time.
But if I tell you it is  as I just did. Were you listening to me?  Isnt that enough?
I think you do know but you wont or cant tell me.  I said before it was going to be my last try and I meant it. I cant think of anything else to do. I wish I could.  We usually wind up screaming and throwing things as the curtain comes down. Then it comes up again and everythings fine. But not this time.  You know there isnt a playwright in the world who could make me believe this would happen between two adult people. Goodbye Margo.
He does not exaggerate. I was good.
Glory Hallelujah.
Ill marry you if it turns out you have no blood at all.
Youve got it backwards. Even for WilkesBarre.
You know what Im going to be?
A foursquare upright downright forthright married lady... thats for me. And no more make believe Off stage or on... remember Lloyd.  I mean it now. Grownup women only I might even play a mother  only one child of course not over eight...  Lloyd will you promise not to be angry with me?
Eve. Eve Harrington.
You didnt have to tell me.
You shouldnt have had any doubts.
Im in love with Margo. Hadnt you heard?
What did you expect  live sables?
Buy some.
You dont have to apologize for me  Im sorry if I hurt your feelings. Its just my way of talkin...
Do you want an argument or an answer?
Night an day.
Like an agent with one client.
My backs open.  Did the extra help get here?
That French ventriloquist taught you a lot didnt he?
Well I certainly think its odd he hasnt even come up...
Miss Harrington...
Probably not.
I might.
You rest. Ill get it...
Hes the best.
Eve. Eve Harrington.
I dont let myself think about it even   but I do know the part so well and every bit of the staging thered be no need to break in a new girl   but suppose I had to go on one night? To an audience that came to see Margo Channing. No I couldnt possibly...
No Eve I wont forget...
Mostly relief that I managed to stagger through it at all...
I dont intend to be.
Do you expect me to believe that you didnt say any of those things  that they were all Addison?
Lets not get overdramatic.
I wish Id never met him Id like him to be dead... I want my friends back.
But not all of it  not that Lloyd and I are going to be married.
I hope so Mr. Richards. Good night...
The four of you must have so much to say to each other  with Mr. Sampson leaving...
Eve...  ... by any chance did you place a call from me to Bill for midnight California time?
Really Eve? Why?
Why not?
I was telling Margo and Lloyd about how often youd seen the play...
Im so happy youre happy.
Of all people you should know what it means to want some peace and quiet
Three or four miles...
It doesnt matter.
More than anything in this world I love Bill. And I want Bill. I want him to want me. But me. Not Margo Channing. And if I cant tell they apart  how can he?
Bills in love with Margo Channing. Hes fought with her worked with her loved her... but ten years from now  Margo Channing will have ceased to exist. And whats left will be... what?
Isnt that what they always say?
Silly isnt it? Youd think theyd fix it so people could just sit in a car and keep warm...
With tears.
Loud.
Up to here Thats where Ive got it  up to here Of all the star ridden presumptuous hysterical
Then a childish heavyhanded routine about not knowing Eve was her understudy
Just a little skid thats all. This roads like glass.
I guess I didnt look. You know I dont pay attention to those things...
Whered you get all that information?
That was a pity...
Im trying hard to follow you.
With gestures of course.
Nothing much. She apologized.
Not much.
Nothing...
Im a human being Ive got some
Too many. And youve got a new guest. A movie star from Hollywood.
The play? All right I guess...
Twentyish. It isnt important.
How do you mean?
Week after week to thousands of people youre as young as you want...
Eve? Eve my understudy? But I had no idea...
She was a revelation...
We are ready with your call to Beverly Hills...
We are ready with the call you placed for 12 midnight California time to Mr. William Sampson in Beverly Hills...
I just played it.
How about me what?
A couple of weeks.
Would you?
This is real cooperation. I appreciate it.
All you got to do is name it.
Margo I wouldnt think of taking that girl away from you...
Well...
it was bullshit the way it was
you only got the job because both you and Bradlee went to Yale
theyre all the same all those Ivy League placesthey teach you about striped ties and suddenly youre smart
Yeah?
Let me lay a little theory on you
a spy you mean?
We need a sympathetic face.
see?
she was panicked Carlevery time I mentioned Watergate you could tell.
Alphabetically on the CREEP phone list Miss Helen Abbott of South George Street.
Youre not a kid anymore.
We know theres got to be something or they wouldnt be so panicked.
I just wish we knew when someone would talk to us thats all.
Its safe try it youll see.
And Im a Republican.
Sure.
Nixon.
Go on go on
we will
shit who do we know?
I havent said anything
Haldeman I know who else?
Could have won him a fraternity paddle with a White House seal.  God knows it worked.
Who?
Its nothing personal though. 
Deep Throat wont confirmI never thought he was scared of anyone but hes scared of Haldeman.
Goddamnit
Whatever.
This?  Naw...
Any idea what he did?
They never told me anything except my own roleI had to find out the rest in the papers.
I know where Dwight works.
Chapin did contact you then?
It gets interesting if it was Haldeman because our word is that when Chapin says something hes gotten the OK from Haldeman and when Haldeman says something hes gotten the OK from the President.
At USC you had a word the this screwing up the opposition you all did it at college and called it ratfucking.  Ever wonder if Nixon might turn out to be the biggest ratfucker of them all?
that was awhile ago
Nobodys perfect.  Im glad youre out of it Hannah youre a terrific reporter and I turned you into a bookkeeper.
omigod there was so much of it six million came in one twoday period six million cash we couldnt find enough places to put it. I thought it was all legal I guess I did til after the breakin when I remembered Gordon got so much of it.
Cause Im not calling out from the phone company anymore  I think the place is bugged.
And that makes anything you do OK is that it?
I will not talk about the other two.
RoutineId just call John Mitchell over at the Justice Department and hed say go ahead give out the money.
And well all have to go to work for a living.
all nondenial denialswere dirty guys and they doubt we were ever virgins but they dont say the story is inaccurate.
Christ I wish I knew if we should print this
you doublechecked both sources?
his dialing finger must be falling off
Electronic surveillance.
Im not here.
I dont know maybe sixteen eighteen hours a dayweve got sources at Justice the FBI but its still drying up.
If you dont like them why wont you be more concrete with me?
John Mitchell resigned as head of CREEP to spend more time with his family. That doesnt exactly have the ring of truth.  Howard Hunts been foundthere was talk that his lawyer had 25 thousand in cash in a paper bag.
To where?
I know what it meansSegretti wouldnt go on the record but if he would we know hed implicate Chapin. And that would put us inside the White House.
Who?be specific. How high up?
Did you change cabs?  It didnt work something moved there
Yes yes everything. There were over fifty people employed by the White House and CREEP to ratfuck some of what they did is beyond belief.
The C.I.A.
Im Woodward.
I think so.
nobody gives a shit about the Dahlberg repercussions
You cant believe that.
Lotsa hints
Thanks Harry.  Know anything about Colson?
Hunt is Colsons man  thats Charles Colson Nixons special counsel  they both went to Brown University  Hunt worked for the C.I.A. till 70 and this is on deep background the FBI thinks hes involved with the breakin.
I dont know but I dont think thats unreasonable either do you?
Larry Young a California lawyer
My wife told me to expect you.  As you know I havent talked to the press.
No. It was closer to seven hundred thousand.
One thing Im not completely clear onwhen you gave out the money to Liddy how did that work?
Okay then.  The rest of you okay with that?
Sorry coach.
Mochaccino.  Actually in the spirit of the pact I do need to ask for your cooperation in one small matter.
As if there were any alternative in the matter.  Are you enjoying yourself?
Mister Finch  are you trying to seduce me?
Yep.
Uhhuh.
Really?  Hey thanks  Heather right?
Just enjoying my exhilarating first lacrosse experience.  You like kicked butt.
You talked to Stifler?

Guys guys  youre ruining my fucking moment here.  Now think about it 
Dude prom sucks.
Nah you get kind of dizzy though.
I think were falling in love.

Professor Roussel. Theres something wrong with you. I know it.
A cure?
I had to be a damn Hemingway hero. Well Ill tell ya the old man and the sea didnt go through half this shit.
I told you. He already tried to contact me once. If you saw his face... He was desperate to tell me something. I owe him this.
Listen either he wastes away as a pathetic vegetable or he can give whats left of his life to save hundreds of potential victims. Hes a McDermott. I know what his choice would be.
I didnt know he had a wine cellar.
Fuck me...
Thats the scar where I stabbed you Oh God... You deliberately took me down there so you could... God I cant believe it
Fuck? You think I dont know this word fuck? Is that how you talk to policemen in America?

If you know about the church why ask such stupid questions?
Why isnt it doing anything?
Oh no... no....
What about me?
Hes on a new drug called ZBH or Daydream. It allows the user to be fully alert and mobile while hes dreaming. He is literally conscious and unconscious at the same time.
Yeah well what if its the Weekly World News...
Its chemistry Andy. Nothing more. Mutated antigens concentrated in the heart of the infector unlock a vaccine like chain reaction in the infectee. There were not many biochemists working in the twelfth century but with todays technology its possible to synthesize any chemical imaginable. When I discovered this ancient cure I knew who to go to.
Yes that sociopath. Hes given himself over to the evil of lycanthropy. To him ADAM is just a threat to the terror he holds over others. To us its salvation.
Thats what Serafine is searching for. Without much luck Im afraid. If only we could speak with him. But alas hes off in another realm close to death.
You sure its not just coz you jerk off too much?

Im fine.
Whos Sophie?
What happened to your parents?
You know its strange  Anastasias grandmother the Dowager Empress Tatiana has been looking for Anastasia since the revolution.  Why do you think she wouldnt go to her own grandmother?

Thats right Mr. Sheldrake. I wont be needing it  because Im all washed up around here.
You?

Its on the way.  I see you went ahead and cut your hair.
Lets not start on that again Jeff  please. Im just beginning to get over it.
Look Jeff  we had two wonderful months this summer  and that was it. Happens all the time  the wife and kids go away to the country and the boss has a fling with the secretary or the manicurist  or the elevator girl. Comes September the picnic is over  goodbye. The kids go back to school the boss goes back to the wife and the girl   They dont make these shrimp like they used to.
Why do you keep calling me Jeff? What do you want from me?
Not here Fran. Cant we go some place else?
We talked about a lot of things.
They got it an a long playing record now  Music to String Her Along By. My wife doesnt understand me  We havent gotten along for years  Youre the best thing that ever happened to me 
Are you sure thats what you want?
I love you  remember?
I was never very good at history. Let me see  there was Miss Olsen and then there was Miss Rossi  no she came before  it was Miss Koch who came after Miss Olsen 
Atlantic City?
The nerve.
I dont know. I guess thats the way it crumbles  cookiewise.

Gook Lieutenant says Fuck you in Vietnamese  Sergeant says dont do that again. Youll wish you hadnt. Then he stood up flicked his iron to rock and roll and gave the little zero a long burst through the Playboy mag. Man it blew him clean off the dock  Hell just the magazine was floatin there all full of holes.
No sir  Im a real chef sir  Im a sauciere 
They lined us all up in front of a hundred yards of prime rib  magnificent meat beautifully marbled.. Then they started throwing it in these big cauldrons all of it  boiling. I looked in an it was turning gray. I couldnt stand it. I went into radio school.

Anyone got a cigarette.
You can see of course the implications if any of this  even rumours leaked out.
Hes commanding the detachment at Nu Mung Ba.
Of course. I  Once we make our repairs we could send word we could have you evacuated from here.
Youll get blown outta here some day.
We endure captain  you can blow up the house and we will live in the cellar  destroy that and well dig a hole in the jungle and sleep on it. Burn the forest and well hide in the swamp. all the while we do but one thing  clean the blood off our bayonets.  Au revoir Captain.

I was making my rounds saw your hangar wide open plane getting rained on so I closed it up.

Shes dead.
The radios on the fritz.
He was sitting in a hot tub with a hooker.
Ill tell you everything later.
 Killing is what you know.  Pack some food while I prep for the flight.  Im sure not gonna let him go.
I took the odds on getting down in one piece and I made it.  Now were in my territory.
Snow shelter.  Okay.  You dig. Ill have a little sitdown.

It wasnt my idea to crash the plane.
You know Meyerling?

What you gonna do with it?  Large bores for shit on small game.
Quit fucking around.  Get in.
Doesnt matter.  We know where theyre going.  Cmon.
Musta never got a chance to more
That plane mightve been to throw us off the track.  Remember the baitandswitch Wilder pulled with the Eskimo and his truck?
We were just talking about him.
Musta wanted to keep him from the bears.  If Ben killed him he sure as hell wouldnt hang him up like this.
Sit your suspect out in the cold. Hell keep.
Do you really want to go back to the runt doctors in Emergency who keep telling us they cant help?
I still dont feel safe leaving Spencer with someone. How do you spell it again?
Stop treating this like Im going away with a man. Hes just going to say those crappy sick complaining angry things to me. I hate this Mom  I hate this. Hes a freak show  the worst person I ever met.
Hes in the bathroom...  Hes fine.
Yes.
Emergency room only.

I was sorry for busting you on that... and Im sorry for busting in on you that night... when I said I was never... I was sorry and Im sorry every time your food was cold and that you had to wait two seconds for a coffee filler...
Thank you.

Melvin pay me a compliment... I need one and quick... You have no idea how much what you said just hurt my feelings.
Thats not compliment Melvin... Thats just trying to sound smart so I feel stupid... A compliment is something nice about somebody else... Now or never.
Tell me even if youre scared. Tell me why you wanted me here. Its okay.
It was a mistake.
What do you mean? You said you liked it.
Yeah... Well...
I dont know whether Im being sensible or hard on you.
It relaxes me... Id feel better just sitting on the curb in front of your house than anyplace else I can think of or imagine.
Okay.
You know what? I...
Yes. I really would.
No let me pull over so I can pay full attention.
No... Nervous. It would be very rough Carol if you werent along.
Im sorry... are you okay?
Thanks. But I just want to take a bath and...
I just love her.  Howre you doing?
Dont want to. I love you.
No. No. Get Carol.
Theres not going to be a debate. You must leave.
Shhhhhhh. I dont have this mountain of available time...  I got to get to my restaurant on time. Do you know how hard it is for me to be here?
Jackie will you hand me the mirror?
Yes. Your dog is fine Simon.
You may think you can intimidate the whole world with your attitude but I grew up in Hell. My grandmother had more attitude. You dont intimidate me.
Hes a pain in the ass.
Concerned. Im just the hall monitor here.
Wait here.
I havent looked at myself yet. I figured I could tell from your reaction.
Well I cant reach them.
Ask him.
Like thick molasses with one of those wide noses perfect for smelling trouble and prison food...
Howre you doing?
Maybe this can wait.
Well I work all the time. So never never again interrupt me. Okay? I mean never. Not 30 years from now... not if theres fire. Not even if you hear a thud from inside my home and a week later theres a smell from in there that can only come from a decaying body and you have to hold a hanky against your face because the stench is so thick you think youre going to faint even then dont come knocking or if its election night and youre excited and want to celebrate because some fudgepacker you dated has been elected the first queer President of the United States... and hes going to put you up in Camp David and you just want to share the moment with someone...  dont knock ...  not on this door. Not for anything. Got me. Sweetheart?
Oh my gosh.
Come on sweetheart...
Thanks.
Not at all huh?... Lets go to the hotel. And if youre lucky tomorrow Dad will give you another wad of sweaty money.
I know. Im a little bit nervous. Suddenly everything seems so easy. Carol a load has been lifted.
Another place where?

Where?
What restaurant?
So youre from around here?

Yellow Pages.  V for veterinarian. There arent that many.

Because he took a contract on you. Hell come for you and hell find you.
He was Russian.  Nicholai Tachlinkov.  A legend in the business when I was just starting. I admired him.  When I heard he loved chess I became obsessed with the game.
Why not?
Ahhhh...

After that?
Thats fiction.
Why not?
Yes.
No.
I dont know... maybe Ill live on a boat sail to all the places Ive never been.

Yes.
How can a beautiful man like you be shy?
Id love one.  Whatever youre having.
I think youre supposed to answer that question.
Sometimes.
No.  They call me I dont call them.  If they didnt call I wouldnt exist.
All the time.
Do you believe that?
Sure.
Average.
Everyone who plays the game knows the rules.
Do they get down on their knees begging and crying?
When I thought about this that was always there in the back of my head that image of me on my knees crying.  It wouldnt go away and it would really upset me. It was something that I could never get away from... but now I feel its okay.  I feel good.
Anything.
You mean quit?
I used to think about it.  I had Margaret.  She wanted kids.  I thought about moving somewhere far away like Europe.  I could see all of that the first part the getting away but I couldnt see that next part.  Then what? So Id stop thinking about it and go back to work.  You understand?
No.
Thats correct.
Im sorry but I am waiting for an associate.  Can you hold everything for me until he arrives?
Thank you.
Like you?
And not even then sometimes.
Whats that? Free

Whadda you need Buckaroo for?
Flying to Cambodia.
How about you? Will you be alright?
...I know this must look... funny.
That son of a bitch... Dont get me wrong hes a fine writer.
Really?...
Barton. Empathy requires... understanding.
Yes. Thank you. Hows Bill?
You wrote Bills scripts  Jesus Christ you wrote his  what about before that?
Hah
Who is that? Gaddamn voices come into the house... sons of bitches...
...Once or twice. His name is Charlie Meadows.
So. You talked to Mundt what about?
And what would that be son?
We need Indians for a Norman Steele western.
But Lipnik said he wanted to look at the script see something by the end of the week.
Well not much.
You dont understand. Hes in pain because he cant write
Are you deaf he LIKES you Hes taken an interest What the hell did you say to him?
Who said write? Jesus Jack cant read.  You gotta TELL it to himtell him SOMEthing for Chrissake.
Okay Barton youre the artist Im just the ten percenter. You decide what you want and Ill make it happen. Im only asking that your decision be informed by a little realism  if I can use that word and Hollywood in the same breath.
No what did it say?
Yeah Im fine Garland  I have to talk to you. Im calling long distance.
Have you read the Bible Garland?
Hell no Call me Charlie. Well Barton you might say I sell peace of mind. Insurance is my game  doortodoor human contact still the only way to move merchandise.
Thanks Ill keep it in mind.
No Im actually writing for the pictures now 
Hell why not? Everyone wants quality. What kind of venue that is to say thematically uh...
Well thats a good question. Strange as it may seem Charlie I guess I write about people like you. The average working stiff. The common man.
Hell I could tell you some stories
I can see you feel pretty strongly about it.
You know in a way I envy you Charlie.  Your daily routine  you know whats expected. You know the drill. My job is to plumb the depths so to speak dredge something up from inside something honest. Theres no road map for that territory...
Not at all. Its damned interesting.
...Yeah okay.
Well thats all that wrestling is. Except usually theres more grunting and squirming before the pin. Well its your first time. And youre out of your weight class.
Hi Charlie.
Yeah as a matter of fact they did. Come on in.
Well its been better. I cant seem to get going on this thing. That one idea the one that lets you get started  I still havent gotten it. Maybe I only had one idea in me  my play. Maybe once that was done I was done being a writer.  Christ I feel like a fraud sitting here staring at this paper.
Thanks brother. But the fact is I gotta pull up stakes temporarily.
Charlie Im in trouble. Youve gotta help me.
You gotta believe me 
I dont know I woke up she was... God you gotta believe me
They GOTTA believe me Charlie They gotta have mercy
Dammit dont argue with me. You asked me to believe you  well I do. Now dont argue with me.
Im at the Earle.
...Both maybe?
Ah forget it kid. I want you to pull this out of your head. If that sonofabitch wouldnt apologize to you goddammit I will. I respect your artistry and your methods and if you cant fill us in yet well hell we should be kissing your feet for your fine efforts.
Youre a sick fuck Fink.
His name is Mundt. Karl Mundt.
Hes a little funny in the head.
Couple of days ago we see the same M.O. out in Los Feliz.
All of which hes now missin.
Anyway.
Female caucasian thirty years old. Nice tits. No head. You ever see Mundt with anyone meets that description?
Give you nose bleeds?
You two have some sick sex thing?
Ah hell let Bart take a crack at it.  Hell get into the swing of things or I dont know writers. Lets make it a dame Bart keep it simple. We dont gotta tackle the world our first time out. The important thing is we all have that Barton Fink feeling but since youre Barton Fink Im assuming you have it in spades.  Seriously Bart I like you. Were off to a good start. Dammit if all our writers were like you I wouldnt have to get so goddamn involved. Id like to see something by the end of the week.
Mr. Lipnik please 
Do you have any evidence that he showed your psychiatric file to anyone?
Home. Watching TV.
Yeah.
When did you start drinking again?
What are you gonna do  charge me with smoking?
My sex life is fine.  My sex life is pretty shitty actually since I stopped seeing you  maybe I should think about my Electrolux again.
Yeah.
She said what you said shed say.
Why didnt you tell me?
Nilsen.
What was she like in school?
Tell me about Catherine.
She didnt hand you to me.  She doesnt even know who you are. She told me about Lisa Henderson.
I got a message on my machine to meet Gus here.  Where is he?
About a year and a half.
Yes.
Are you arresting me?
Only when they make interesting reading.
It wont last.
Yes it does doesnt it?
I felt somebody had read my book and was playing a game.
No.
You still get the pleasure.  Didnt you ever fuck anybody else while you were married Nick?
Why not?
You know I dont like to wear any underwear dont you Nick?
Four shootings in five years.  All accidents.
Theres a name from the past.
Yes you did.  They never tested you did they?  But Internal Affairs knew.
I have attorneys.  They have friends.  I have friends.  Money buys you a lot of attorneys and friends.
Dont get too cocky.
What if I call you Nicky?
I know Nicky but I like it.
To see if I can get away with it.
I told her it was the fuck of the century.
I dont have a choice.
No.
For what... to set me up?  She loved me she wouldnt frame me.
I never have before.
Try me.
I found Lisa Henderson.
Im very good at research.  Ill help you.
What are you researching?
What happens to them?
It wont sell.
We fuck like minks.  We raise rugrats.  We live happily ever after.
What are you going to do?  Charge me with smoking?
Exactly what do you have in mind Mr. Corrigan.
Id have to be pretty stupid to write a book about a killing and then kill him the way I described in my book. Id be announcing myself as the killer.  Im not stupid.
He was murdered.
Was his wife ever a suspect?
Do you remember his name?
The usual  a girlfriend.
Nope. She did.  Like I say.  It never panned.
I didnt know you knew who Picasso was Gus.
She misses me.
What are you doing here Pop?
Hell yes  Couldnt get it outta my head for years.  Still cant. Nice little kids  nice husband wasnt porkin around  no financial problems.  One day  outta the clear blue sky  she does em.  All of em.  Used a knife. He got for a wedding present. Didnt even deny it.  Sweet as honey.  Said she didnt know why she done it.
I dont son but I got the minority opinion.
You oughta use a rubber pop.  You really should.
In that little pissant car of yours? Hell no.  I aint gettin no back pain disability retirement  Im gettin me a full pension and a real goldplate Seiko watch.
Catherine told me what was in it.
Maybe she did Gus.  Maybe she grew herself an Afro and learned a left hook and put shoe polish on her face.  Lets polygraph her again and ask her about it.
He looks a little shrunk thats all.
Go stick your head in a tub of ice water.  See where she leads.
You forgot her degree in literature. Shes a writer.  She published a novel last year under a pen name. Do you want to know what its about?
We bring her in for questioning.
She didnt ask me for the ride. She asked anybody.
What now what? Now nothing.  She passed the polygraph.  Thats it.
Her parents died in an accident. I dont care what else shes written.  What are you  a book critic?
Catherine Tramell.  Its part of her game.
It was an accident.
I dont think she meant to go off the hill do you?
On what basis?
She was the last person seen with the guy  Ill take the responsibility.
Are you vice?
Im Roxy.  Im her  friend.
No. Should I have?
Not sure. How was yours?
Do you ever get sick of it?
I havent felt like talking to him since that thing came out.
Oh I didnt know that.
My jacket? Gee great...  Your show looks great. Quite a turnout. You look great. You kids. You drink red wine with fish. You can do anything Make paintings in the basement of your gallery? First time Ive heard of that
Yeah I met her already.
Gee. I dont need to. Youre a natural. You should sign up with my modeling agent.
I dont like beer.
How do you know?
Sure ok..
I need a dealer.
Where? Do you ask Miles where he got that note from? Where do you take your words from?  Everywhere.
Who said that?
Chateau Latour 64 please.
See that table over there? Id like to pay their bill.
Really?
Use your fucking instinct.
Why dont you try letting her in Steve  I mean Shenge.
Thanks.  Your dad called again  something about a job.
Were getting married. She said she could tell I was a great artist  she could see it in my eyes. She said she wanted to be by my side and have interracial babies with me.
So then what?
I guess it was a long time ago.
Cmon baby I painted them for you. Theyre beautiful now.
Its Monday morning.
I hadnt thought about it.
You mean babies with you?
Youre your own baby.
Hi.
A present I picked up for you.
Hes not. Hes out of town and he calls me every day. Whats weird about him?
Whats that about?
I dont believe it Jean  theyre picking straws.
Me? Why?
You like your dads paintings?
Thanks
Have a Mac.
Fuck...  I forgot about that.
Tony Bennett... What do you mean?
Thanks... Ill take it tonight.
Thats impossible. Ive got like five of em
I just dont think youre being fair.
Yo... You know why Rammellzees here dont you?
Affair ... yes maybe ... if she ...
Youll never guess.
Touring the riot scene.  Gravely assessing the devastation. Upstanding mayor stuff.
Well I could ... free up some time...
Treat to be here.
I wouldnt be caught dead.  No its probably how I would be caught.  The Mayor stupidly took Cobblepots bait 
Yes and no...
Somewhat like the lonesome secretary syndrome Id suppose.
If I said yes then you might think me a Norman Bates or a Ted Bundy type ... and then you might not let me kiss you.
Ymean take off our costumes?
But a kiss can be even deadlier if you mean ... it.
I dont know.  Till we figure it out lets ... lets keep dancing.
Weird huh?
Max Im gonna fight you on this. The Mayor and I have already spoken and we see eye to eye here.  So 
Sorry Max.  A die for a die.
He uisu Batman you moron.
Batman.  The thorn in both our sides the fly in our ointment.
Youre off the hook Ozzie.  But Batman is decidedly unotu.
The name is Oswald Cobblepot.
Women... nothing surprises me Chip. Excepting your late mother... Who even knew Selina had a brain to damage?  Bottom line  she tries to blackmail us we drop her out a higher window.  Meanwhile I got badder fish to fry.  Yeah  Oswald please.
And exactly uwhyu am uIu gonna help uyouu?
A big bag of fan mail?  Filthy lucre?  Wait dont tell me ... Is it a broad?
Im the one you want  Penguin please  Ask yourself  Isnt it Max Shreck who manipulated and betrayed you?  Isnt it Max not Chip whom you want to see immersed up to his eyeballs in raw sewage?
And who ... would you say this utou?
Ten years.  Barbara isnt really me niece sir. Shes Joanna Clarks daughter.
Oh no those things frighten me.
I have been trying to reach Wilfred with no success.  As one grows older one yearns for family.
As Ive missed you.  Sleep well child.
I have been part of the greatest adventure ever know.  I have found purpose here and the family I could never have.
Perhaps the truth is you dont really trust anyone.
Secrets are a virtual prerequisite in this house dont you think?
Theres a lovely inn just down 
Alfred I know youre sick  I can get you the best doctors.
Remember this.  And remember it always.  Im proud of you.  And I love you too son.
What seems to be the problem?
Keep it.
Alfred and Bruce are like family.
Alfreds happy here.
Nightwing.  Scourge of darkest evil.
I know.  The feeling just vanished.
Definitely.
A poison kiss?  You have some real issues with women you know that?  You just couldnt stand that she was about to kiss me.  Couldnt stand that something might be mine and not yours.  Could you?
She knows who we are.
Dont make me kill you in front of the girl.
Actually I already work for you. Or did.  Your arboreal preservation project in South America.
I see you knew him.
Can I get some help over here?
What?  Im sorry.  You were saying...
I know youre a dedicated bachelor. That youve had a your wild nights.
What?
Presumed dead.  No one knows.
Whoa I made a mistake.  Im sorry. Dont go all protective on me.  It wont happen again.
Anybody want to tell us kids in the cheap seats who Joanna Clark is?
Dick dont push me right now.
Shes clouded your mind.  Youre not thinking straight.
I knew you could handle it.
Listen Captain Cold the suit maybe even though silver went out in the 70s.  But those boots are unforgivable. What is it with men?
Adam and Evil.
Youre skating on thin ice.  My passion thaws for my bride alone.
Of trust. Tell me your plan.
Then you never loved me?
Then youd have nothing to complain about.
What did you say?
Of course. 13 is M....MRE.
Claw Island. Nygmas headquarters. Im sure thats where theyre keeping Chase.  Are all the Batsuits destroyed?
Just checking young sir.
Im flattered. Not every girl makes a superheros night table.  You might have some interesting insights into TwoFace.
Are you trying to get under my cape Doctor?
Its the car right? Chicks love the car.
No more tricks Edward. Release Chase and Dick. This is between you and me.
Excellent. See. Who says a guy in a rubber suit cant be smart? Well its been grand. Sorry you all have to die now.
Bruce Wayne. In the flesh.
Nygma. Edward Nygma. You hired me. Personally. Just like I tell everyone.  Well weve never actually met but your name was on the hire slip.
Wait. You cant go.
Somebodys been sending me love letters. Commissioner Gordon thought you might give me your expert opinion.
So what youre saying this guys a total wacko right?
I dont get you Bruce Wayne.
The glib cavalier routine it really is an act isnt it?
What?
Excuse me boys. Id hate to stop this testosterone flood on my account
Okay tiger take it slow. You going to give me your pin or something?
I saved your life. You owe me. So either you let me be your partner or Im going after Harvey on my own.
Dick let go. Revenge will eat you alive. Trust me. I know.
And when you finally get TwoFace?
Cant tell if you dont say please.
...Fired...your fired...your fired. You understand? Fired
Please. I swear I wont say noth
You are TwoFace you would need to face both rivers both uptown and downtown simultaneously. Only one spot in Gotham serves these bi zonal bicoastal needs...
Lets see if you bleed green.
So not everyone can be a poet. Still I respect the sentiment.
Here. Get a good seat.
Id say about thirty feet sir.
Respectfully sir... therell never be another one like you.
Dont ever say that sir. Dont ever believe it.
WHICH CAR?
I know. I called them.
He wont kill her.  GODDAMMIT
... A hundred and eight?
... Where are you taking me?
Exploring. In the woods. Many years ago.  I was a solitary child.
I dont want to jeopardize anyone close to me.
What is it you want?
Neither had I.  Odd desire for a woman I guess.
Vicki if I say anything cryptic or... ambiguous I think you should put the most flattering possible interpretation on it.  Because even if it doesnt sound that way... thats how Ill mean it.
Maybe we should just kiss.
Im serious Bruce. We have to  
No one would miss me.
What are you talking about?
Look Johnny Gobs got ripped and walked off a roof all right?  No big loss.
No wonder youre such a chickenshit.  Now shut up.  There aint no bat.
Because I want someone I can trust.
A girl could get killed   so they tell me.  Whats new and hot in Gotham City?
Our next D.A.  I hear Bruce Wayne is throwing a fundraiser.  Did you get your invitation yet?
Well Im starving.  Will you at least buy me a hamburger?
Some.  I am a rich bitch remember?  Im quoting.
... Oh?  Why is that Vicki?
... Okay then I have a confession to make.  Im the Batman.
Allie... he wants to tell me. I had a roll of film. His face was on it. He knew that  And he let me keep.
Sounds great.  Excellent.  Though Ahm... theres this guy whos coming to work at the Gallery from England...
I said Id check with you.
Whats wrong with you David?  All you have to do is say Excuse me Ive been sitting here since the start of the Millennium and Id really like some action from you before the end of the world. Ill go.
Now what does that mean?  My daughter wakes up with a strange man in her bed and Im supposed to think its amusing?  That ties Godawful.  Why do you wear it?
No Im fine.
Night.
Great.  Classic timing.  Why dont you ask her just to leave a date for the divorce?  Ill check my diary later.
Yes.  Ahm... think I11 ...
Ahm.....
Whistler was a great painter but he wasnt a great chooser of paints ....
Well Ahm....
But the particular glory of the system... is that it can also work oh large screens in each individual room  so we can network the program to every room in the gallery.
Shes ... well shes good.
Yes isnt he.
Great news.
Okay sir.  Certainly.  Good.
I thought perhaps as VicePresident and in view of the unfortunate attendances for the summer show this year... the MASSIVE financial LOSS ...
Time taken its toll on the old girl eh?
Certainly is.
Richard Burton was very goodlooking.
Not in one piece anyway.  I see Mrs Whistler as kind of ... like my own dear mother.  Id kill any man that tried to interfere with her.  The Vice President here will vouch for that.
Thats one  way of looking at it.  You might also say this guy is brainless he has no brain.
I11 give you a chance... Know anything about computers?
Damn.  I was just going to Number 4 ....
Yes it is ... may I introduce you To Bern ...
Its a kind of an interesting swap. Mom for the Man from Ga Ga.
Sting?  Sounds like something you put on a rash.
No it wasnt
Yeah heh heh and then were gonna get a bigscreen TV Heh heh.

Where are his pants?
Yoohoo Travis and Bob Head. Whoohoo
Uh my butt and your...uh butt.
Yeah they were sluts. Huh huh huh.
I dont see anything about Rewards and Punishments or Heaven and Hell.  This book reads like stereo instructions  Listen to this... Geographical and Temporal Perimeters... Functional perimeters vary from manifestation to manifestation.  This is going to take some time.
uYouu left me.
Nothing.  The bio buster?  I dont get it...
Were not going to wait here like cornered animals.  I can tell you that.  We need help.  Im going to talk to that little girl.
Look at this everything is different down here.  All our furniture is gone.
Shes got uphotosu Barbara.
Of course I did.
I dont care Ive changed my mind.  ... I feel ureallyu confident.  Were getting better at this stuff.  We can scare them off ourselves  tonight  Ive got an idea.  Youre going to love it... Im going to hate it.
Lets see if she can get my model back.
I certainly did.  Id finish it too but... I dont get out much.
Wait a minute.  I had some licorice ice cream earlier.  You guys could be gas.  What if... Im dreaming. Can you do any neat tricks to prove youre not gas?
Good luck.  Youre going to use up all your help vouchers.
We have to start simpler is that it?
Bioubustingu.  I ulovesu biobusting. Who do I gotta kill?  Family  right?  Obnoxious I bet.  Mommie daddy piglets.
Hey uyouveu been on Saturn  I uhateu those sandworms  uYecchhhu Ive lost a lot of buddies to sandworms.  So a daughter?  She got good legs? God I love a young leg.
Hey Ive been in a frigging bottle for six hundred years.  I was out.  Every dog has his day. This is my town.  I need a night to howl.
About what?
No Lydia were dead.
And live in what our station wagon?
Bye Jane Ill see you in church in a couple weeks.
Theyre dead.
Well it cant be any worse than my life here.
I... I dont know what your name is.
Its spelled different but basically... Now you said it twice just one more time and Ill be free.  And then uyoullu be free.
Howd you like to have the biggest boobs in the world?  Right now.  I can do it if I get out.
Howd you like to be married to... the King...?
Otho why didnt you just come in the door?
Lets hope he knows how to produce those damn ghosts for Max and Sarah... Because Ive bought options on property all over town.  I need Maxs financing...
My whole life is a darkroom  One ... big... dark... room.
Lydia were the first trickle In a couple of years this whole town will be ufilledu with people like us.
Stepmother.
Lydia I dont know what it is with you and these pratical jokes but 
Come on.  Leave their stuff alone.
I cannot believe this.
I cant ubringu the ghosts.  Theyre not here
Nonsense everytime she says that the paint peels and some wild creature tries to kill us.
Theyre already dead.  They cant feel a thing.
This is our first meal in this house Lydia.  Why dont we all do our little private parts to make it a pleasant one?
I saw some ghosts.
Viridian?
uI knowu  We just have to uprayu that the other closets are bigger than this one.
Attic space.
Probably the worlds largest uReadersu uDigestu collection  Cmon lets have some chablis Otho Im laid bare by this experience.  Entirely bare.
Thats a skeleton key.  Itll open any door in that house.  Will you give it to your father?  And you might mention that I singlehandedly decorated the house.  In case he needs advice in that area.  Come see me.
Yes but Im going to live at home.
Hold your breath and well pull.
My sentiments exactly.  Porcelain is for teeth
Ill need something personal of theirs.
Their wedding clothes.
Oh fine.
Yes.
Thank you.
Yes I could stay here. Thank you.
Yes Robert. I will.
Hardly any Robert.
Yes Robert. I know about the President.
How do I know when its ten oclock?
... Youve become quite a close friend of Eves  havent you Mr...  ... Chance...?
I see...  ... And you are really a gardener arent you?
To everyone Im afraid. The Government controls are so restricting that the Medical Profession as we know it is being legislated out of existence.
We have common foes Chauncey  kid lawyers and our physician
I wanted some fresh air Robert. How is Mr. Gardiner?
Yes he is different... Not the kind of person one usually meets in Washington.
Hes very intense and internal dont you think?
I dont think so he should be along soon...
Hmmm. You say he showed you his garden?
Gardiner is not a foreign agent there are now sixteen countries investigating the man. We can rule that out.
And what do the boys around Intelligence think?
Gentlemen needless to say there is going to be a full Congressional investigation of your respective operations.  Good night.
Well I still dont believe I know the man Mr. Gardiner. Now hold still.
Thank you.
Yes. I would like to be on that show.
Theres no need for a hospital.
I agree.
I like to watch. This is fine.
Yes.
No. The Old Man died and Louise left.
He was a very wealthy man he looked after me since I was young.
... Mentor...?
Hello Eve.
Thats good. I like to watch too.
I see.
Yes. That could be true.
Thank you.
No. Im not busy.
Yes I do its very good.
Ben is very ill.
We are not far...  ... our chairs almost touch.
Do you think so? Do you think so?
Sure you do. This ward is air tight I have a little extra oxygen pumped in keeps my spirits up.
Whatd I tell you? Kidlawyers The S.E.C. Damn them
Yes. Chauncey is fine.
I see. I would like to work in your garden.
But I dont have that any more...  ... All thats left for me now is the room upstairs.
Youre looking much better today Ben.
I understand.
Yes. That is correct.
I understand.
A flower...
Yes.
Yes I would like to see Ben.
No.
No.  Thats where Joe fixed the bricks.
It is quite amazing how those clothes have come back into style.
No. Im not badly injured. But my leg is very sore.
I agree.
How long? I dont know see what the doctor says ...
... Good evening Louise.
Must of happened durin the night I dont know... Lord he wasnt breathin and as cold as a fish. I touched him just to see and you believe me Chance  thats doin more than I get paid to do... Then I just covered him up pulled the sheet over his head...
I am a very serious gardener.
... The gardener?  ... Yes of course... Mr. Chance this is Ms. Hayes.
Yes Thomas  I understand.
Yes. Louise will bring me lunch.
I live here.
No I do not have any of those.
Yes and the Old Man used to come to my garden. He would read and rest there.
You have me I am here. What more proof do you need?
Very well Mr. Chance  if you insist on dragging this matter on... But I must inform you this house will be closed tomorrow at noon. If indeed you do reside here you will have to move out.
Try again.
I may be a shutin but I do not lack for news. Im sorry you had to go through all that.
... Thank you Chauncey... Thank you very much.  ... All right Robert Im all yours.
Thank you Wilson. That will be fine.
Would you two excuse me for a moment?
Oh no sweetheart  its not you...
Gladly...  ... The safe is in Mr. Jennings bedroom thatll be stop number one.
... Its very bizarre  I dont know what to think...
He does talk like one but I think hes brilliant.
Sally Hayes is not a bitch  shes a damn fine attorney Ive got to talk to her about this Gardiner...
There is no information available on the man before he moved into Benjamin Rands. It has proven to be such a difficult task that it has resulted in the loss of one of our agents to the United States Government.
Very good Your Excellency.
Gardiner yes sir.
No problem Chief.
Right Chief.
Right Chief.
Well sir  it occurred to us that he might be an agent of a foreign power. But we ruled that out as they invariably are provided with too much documentation too much American identity... We uh...dont quite know what to make of it yet sir... But well keep on top of it Mr. President  well come up with the answer.
Thank you Colonel.
Mr. Gardiner my pleasure.
Overall  pretty good. But Mr. President I think its very dangerous to resort to temporary measures at this stage of the game.
I sympathize with your position Mr. President I know how difficult it is to be straightforward the reaction to such a speech could be chaos.
Please have a seat.
Exactly that. We can put you inside someone elses body for fifteen minutes.
Well you know maybe something else until this whole puppet thing turns around.
Adorable. What time are they supposed to be here?
We have to make it an early night.
Hmmm.
Oh you know not a lot. Just hanging around his apartment. I think he must be a lonely man.
You should feed your animals. Theyre looking peaked.
What?
Life is confusing isnt it?
I feel that somehow my parents never prepared me to make this particular decision. Not that I blame them. How could they know? Todays world is so complicated.  No. I have to go away now. Im sorry Lotte. Im so sorry.
Yeah well welcome to the nineties.
Thats true. Oh God Lotte what have I become? My wife in a cage with a monkey. A gun in my hand. Betrayal in my heart.
Im so glad youre safe. You look really wonderful.
Youll have me after all Ive done to you?
Holy shit He said what I said
This portal is mine and must be sealed up forever. For the love of God.
No uh my name is Craig Schwartz. I have an interview with Mr. Lester.
Schwartz.
I am a trained performer.
Thank you for being kind enough to lie. You see Ive been very lonely in my isolated tower of indecipherable speech. Youre hired. Any questions?
Low overhead mboy. We pass the savings on to you.  But seriously thats all covered in orientation.
Dr. Lester I dont know what youre talking about.
Youre insane.
Yes. Unfortunately its bullshit. The real story of 7 12 is so evil that it could never be revealed to Americans raised on sitcoms and happy news anchors.
How dreary  to be  Somebody  How public  like a Frog  To tell ones name  the livelong June  To an admiring Bog
Great.  Buuuhhppaahhhhnnn. . . . . Muhhhahhhhh. . . . . ahhhnnnaaa. . nollltuuukkkaaaaralllll. . . tashabararassssssuuuuusaaaaaaa. . . nnnnnnnaaaaaannnnnnnnncccccceeeeeee Mwaaaaaa. . . . .Mahhhhhkkkkk. . . sssseeeeeen. Maxine?
Im right?
My tits?
Dont let the girly shit fool you. Itd blow your shorts off.
Youre not someone I could get interested in. Craig. You play with dolls.
You might want to check those tarot cards one more time.
Is this Malkovich fellow appealing?
Ill protect you Dollface.
So unbolt the fucking door Einstein.

Move right hand across her left breast now. Move right hand across her left breast now. Move right hand across her left breast now.
Yes yes sweetheart yes

Can I be anyone I want?
The kids got talent. Youve never seen Malkovich like this. Schwartz had him up there singing and dancing. Impressions.
Maxine says shell leave him if he leaves Malkovich plus hes been challenged to a puppetduel by Mantini.
Why are you being like this?
Well if Mantini wins Schwartz will leave Malkovich right? So if he needs it I help Mantinis performance a bit give him an edge. Spice up the show.
Fine. Lets drop it.
Fine. Im not mad. Lets just drop it.
Do you?
All the better. Hey Hot Lesbian Witches next Geraldo buddy boy. Ha ha ha.
Lots of carrot juice little lady. That and a deal with the Devil.
My child I dont think its a great mystery what Craigs up to.
Craig stole Maxine from me Dr. Lester.
No you dont understand. Ive been inside Malkovich when Im with Maxine...
Why not? I need to get in there
Ive never been looked at like this by a woman.
I love you Lotte.
Really? Well you know hes quite good. Im surprised. Anyway I have a session with Malkovich I have to attend. Ill speak with you soon.
I thought so too doll. I guess we were mistaken.
Did you see the reviews?
Yeah. Ive figured out how to hold on as long as I want. Oddly enough its all in the wrists.
Oh darling. Its a dream come true. Were going to ride this straight to the top.
Ive got to leave Malkovich.
Derek Mantini

Well okay youre not privy to all the new shit so uh you know but thats what you pay me for.  Speaking of which would it be possible for me to get my twenty grand in cash? I gotta check this with my accountant of course but my concern is that you know it could bump me into a higher tax
Whore you working for?  Lebowski? Jackie Treehorn?
Crazy huh?  Ran away a year ago.
Fuck you.
Nothing.
Yeah Dude why is Walter so pissed off?
Walter how

Relax man  No physical harm intended
Jeffrey Lebowski.
Thank you.
Yes I know about it.  And I know that you acted as courier.  And let me tell you something  the whole thing stinks to high heaven.
I like it too.  Its a male myth about feminists that we hate sex. It can be a natural zesty enterprise. But unfortunately there are some peopleit is called satyriasis in men nymphomania in womenwho engage in it compulsively and without joy.
He fixes the cable?
Little Lebowski Urban Achievers yes and proud we are of all of them. I asked my father about his withdrawal of a million dollars from the Foundation account and he told me about this abduction but I tell you it is preposterous.  This compulsive
I uh... money yeah I gotta respecfully 69 you know tender my resignation on that matter cause it looks like your mother really was kidnapped after all.
Now I got
Look Jeffrey you dont really kidnap someone that youre acquainted with.  You cant get away with it if the hostage knows who you are.
Do you still have that doctors number?
Oh?
Well yes what did you think this was all about?  Fun and games?
You brought a fucking Pomeranian bowling?
Twenty grand.  And of course I still keep the rug.
What if its during a game?
Huh?
Its your roll.
The ringer  The ringer Dude  Have they called yet?
Well youre right Dude I got to thinking.  I got to thinking why should we settle for a measly fucking twenty grand
Dude nothing is fucked.  Come on. Youre being very unDude.  Theyll call back.  Look she kidnapped her
Yeah.  Thats a great plan Walter. Thats fucking ingenious if I understand it correctly.  Thats a Swiss fucking watch.
Your wheel Dude  Im rolling out
Thats right Dude 1   certain
Yeah yeah kill that poor woman.
Hmm.  Well we were in a handicapped spot.  It uh it was probably towed.
But Walter
Theyre gonna kill her Walter and then theyre gonna kill me
Now Dude
Huh?
No Im
The InandOut Burger is on Camrose.
Not exactly a lightweight.
Well its sometimes the cathartic uh.
Yeah?
You thought Bunnyd been kidnapped and you could use it as a pretext to make some money disappear.  All you needed was a sap to pin it on and youd just met me.  You thought hey a deadbeat a loser someone the square community wont give a shit about.
WALTER FOR CHRISTS SAKE  HES CRIPPLED  PUT HIM DOWN
He cant walk Walter
Hey cool it Walter.
Come on Walter.
Its uh its down there somewhere. Lemme take another look.
I understand sir.  Could you slide your shorts down please?
You told Brandt on the phone he told me.  So where do I fit in?
Wheres the money Lebowski?
This is not Nam.  This is bowling. There are rules.
A world of pain.
Youre missing the point.  Their vampire victims dont die.  They turn.  They become carriers.  If the Reapers continue unchecked there could be thousands of them before the month is over.  Do the math.
Minutes.
If thats true what about Nomak?  Hes been alive longer than the others.
Like cancer with a purpose.
It doesnt have to be like that.  We dont have to be enemies.
If thats true then whyd you save me?
I want to see the sun rise.
Did you think I wouldnt?
Sounds like a plan.
These guys are shitting bricks cause theyre no longer on the top of the food chain.  Theyre going to fuck us the first chance they get.
Ill show you.
Well split into three units.  First team that makes contact wins the prize. Try to maintain radio silence from here on out.
Blood...
Look I care about the humans who are dying not you got it?
I should think that would be obvious at this point.
Ultrarapid detox.  They use it on heroin addicts make em go coldturkey in one night.
He wants us to know hes hunting us now.
Nomak said something to Blade in Greek. Athelfiki singenia ex amato.  Where did he learn that?
Two so far.
As scripted?  Youve already lost two of your own.  How many more are you willing to sacrifice?
Fuck yeah.  Whole packagell crank this betty up another threehundred horsepower.
Yeah but you didnt have the Scudster working on it did you?
Just do it old man.
Wait.
Maybe I dont see it that way.
Frost
Im sorry I 
Not anymore. Youve seen one of them. You wont be allowed to live after that.
He didnt. Get over it.
Hes a familiar. A human who works for the vampires. See this mark?
Why in Gods name would anyone want to work for them?
There is no cure.
What do you see here?
Those arent real memories. No one has that kind of recall.
If youre not human then why do you bleed like us? Ive seen vampire blood you dont have it running through your veins.
Your mother sounds like a Hallmark greeting card.
Im not leaving without you.
Youre a week early.
Then what is it?
This is purely professional curiosity Karen I swear.
No problem.
Study him. Unlock the secrets of his DNA. Hes the key weve been looking for.
Please. You and the other Elders wouldnt know what to do with these texts if your lives depended on it.  Which of course they do.
Perhaps.
Why? Because we live at another species expense? Your people farm cattle and veal dont they? Fattening them up with steroids? Its called evolution Doctor. Survival of the fittest.
Youve been bitten by a vampire. Weve got to try and burn out the venom just like a rattlesnake bite 
Some of the old wives tales are true  theyre severely allergic to silver various types of wood. Feed them garlic and theyll go into anaphylactic shock 
What happens if he doesnt take the serum?

I have no hard proof of any of this. Her address is also on the photos. I think these people are involved with drugs. and murder. I think Frank is killing drug dealers and.  . and somehow Frank is getting all their drugs. I had to tell you I got slightly more involved in this than you wanted me to but its over now for sure. .I had to tell you about these things in case it could help.
Yes sir.

No.
Don?. Are you in with them?
Who are you? Maybe Ill need to. you like me huh?
Hello.
Frank is coming?
Sure I do.
No. I told you. I dont want to hurt you. I want to help you. I think I know some of what is happening to you.  . Dorothy? Frank has your husband and son. Dorothy? Doesnt he? You have to do something Dorothy. go to the police.
Beeeee careful.
Just get outta my bed.
I did. are you?
Why are you here?  Hmmmmmmmm Ok.
Its okay. its okay.
They hurt his head.
Don?. Where is he?
Yeah. I sure know that. Yeah but how many more are out there?
Yes.
You were pretty popular. Didnt you run for some office?
Thats too bad.
I dont really know much but bits and pieces . I hear things. My room is right above my fathers office. The ear. theres no corpse in the morgue missing an ear and it did come off a living person. Thats direct from the Coroners Office. The person is unknown. There are a couple of cases I get mixed up on but I think there are some people who were brought in for questioning on a murder case that could have something to do with the ear. I heard some of the same names.
Maybe so.
Not really why?  You want to see the building?. Come on Ill show you.
Still it must be kinda rough.
I dont know. he moved away.
Yeah. Good bye.
Ooooo you are smart. Just dont get too smart.
Settle down. I have a plan which I think will work. There is very little for you to do but I do need your help. .Arent you curious about my plan?
Right out in the car I happen to have some old overalls and a bug spraying rig. I will go to her apartment and be the pest control man. I will spray her apartment. After a few minutes you will knock on her door drawing her attention away from me and I will then jimmy a window.
First of all well have a nice dinner. Try to find out where Dorothy sings.
Great. Ill pick you up around eight oclock. Is that good?
First of all were going to the Slow Club to see Dorothy Vallens. Well watch her for awhile. Id like to hear her sing anyway and then also well know she is there and not in her apartment.
Then well drive back to her apartment and I will plant myself there.
That sounds good.
I dont know if youre a detective or a pervert.
Well. Ive found out some things. nothing really for certain. There are some strange people involved.
No way. Im about to blow up.
. OK. Its a strange world Sandy. this is what I have found out. What I think I have found out. Dorothy Vallens is married to a man named Don. they have a son. I think the son and the husband have been kidnapped by a man named Frank who has now cut off both of Dons ears. I think he is holding them to make her do things for him. I think she wants to die. the ears were for her a warning to stay alive. there is another man involved. I call him the yellow man. you saw his back the other day in the hall at her door. I dont know what he does but I think hes on drugs supplied by Frank. Frank is a very dangerous man.
I dont see how I can. and I cant prove any of this. I got all this information illegally. also it could get you in trouble.
Why are there people like Frank. Why is there so much trouble in this world.?
I guess so. you want to help me watch Frank?. Im going to stake out Franks place tomorrow. with a camera.
Number one. I saw the Yellow Man go into Franks building laughing with Frank. Now. the only trouble is. what does this prove?
Jeffrey
What is it?
Where to?
Lets wait for some slow one.
Frank
No. Is Detective Gordon going to be at your house?
Go ahead.
Go ahead
No Jeffrey
Yeah. I just saw him outside. Maybe the robins are here.
uh uh.
uh uh.
Its good to see you Dad.
Hey Jeff. Im feelin so much better.
Jeffrey when you see your father.
Looks like youd make a good runner.
I mean you dont exactly have the build for a football. I mean. no offense.
Later Mike. I gotta take care of someone whos hurt here in case you havent noticed.
Really hell be home soon would you like a cup of coffee?
Yeah. okay.
You can change it if you want to.
Sure. just a sec.  Excuse me.
Where do you guys want to count?
What plane?  We going someplace?  Where we headed?  You have your money.  Its all there.  What the fuck is going on?
My pleasure Augusto.  Diego has told me much about you.
Thats impossible.  We cant be up and running.  Whos distributing?
Thanks.  I am.  Wheres Martha?
Derek
What is?
Youll see for yourself.
Are you kidding?
Relax baby.  Were going to wind up like us.
Which brings me to rule number three which says fuck rules one and two skip bail and take off.
Something about vengance being best served cold.
What details?  I put the coke in the false bottoms and take it through customs.
What?  Yeah sure.
My clothes your clothes.  What does it matter?
Its a lousy fifteen kilos.  I piss fifteen kilos.
Diego needs to see you right away please.  Excuse us Amorcito.
Its your grass.
Youre kidding right?  Thats a hundred pounds a week.
Its already been negotiated.  Its done.  The money is there waiting.
You guys are such babies.  You want to go home go.  Me Im not going to stop until I find the fucking motherlode.
Nice doing business with you George.
Yeah.  I understand.  Just business. Right.  Fuck you.
Its in the past.  Im out of the business now so forget about it.  No hard feelings.  We need to move on.  And besides Im sorry too.
I dont want to talk about it.
Nothing.  Just a little project.
Twentysix months?  For murder?  I must be your lawyer.
Only two ways I know to leave here early.  One is to escape.
Because I got caught.
I dont know Diego.  Ive got a good thing going already.  Everybody smokes pot.  Its easy.  Cocaine is a rich mans drug.  Its too expensive.
Yes.  And a kilo of coca is smaller than a kilo of your precious marijuana. Everything is the same George except instead of thousands you are making millions.
And what happens when these guys stop paying?  Sooner or later these guys are going to cut us out.  Then where are we?
Jesus Christ Diego where are you? Its been eleven days and these guys want their fucking money.
Try the closet.
Everything is not alright.  I bring you in and you slap my fucking face
Es un Ford blanco junto a una pickup.
What?
George dont be so emotional.  This is business.  Besides I cant kill you you are my brother.
Coke.
I dont know.  Maybe eighteen grams.
The boy is happy Fred.  Dont be such a killjoy.
Take your boots off.  Youre tan.
You mean the drug money?  Yes I got it.
Oh I see.
Actually it was three.
Yes.
Yes it is.
Yes sir.  As much as you can give me.
Power?
Yeah well...
I didnt come here to drink scotch.
Youre saying life will take care of Diego?
Yeah well what are you gonna do?  You and me Pablo?  Are we good?
Thats too bad.  You would have been the first one in the family.
Alright.  You want me to get your old job back?  Because I could you know I could put in that word.
Im going to California.
You loved her didnt you?  You really loved her.
Tough spot.
Let me tell you something son.  You would have been great at anything.
Yeah Dad.  Im happy right now.
Yeah I know.  This is it isnt it?
That was a good one Dad.  That was really something.  Remember that?
That was a beautiful message.
What about him?
Holy shit Dulli.  What the hell are you doing here?
I know who you are El Americano. Mister George.
She did that before.
My problem?  Were broke thats my fucking problem.  And youre a fucking spy.
Yeah well.  Im working on that.  Ive got something going.
Yeah you will.  Of course.
Well I got a call from Pablo.  He said this thing with Diego is a disaster. Hes giving up lab locations names bank accounts he was very pissed off. Pablo said to take him down.  His exact words were Fuck Diego.
Are we gonna split up?
Yeah.
Swear on my life.
Shhhh.
Shortly after I arrived at Danbury Federal Correctional Institute I related to Diego that the crime I was in for was smuggling marijuana. Diego told me he had high level connections in Colombia and they needed to find someone to help them transport cocaine into America...
Sounds fine.  Ill need to meet everybody.
Yes I am.
Yeah but what are you doing out here?
This calls for a joint.  You want to do the honors?
Relax.  Ive flown with my old man a million times.  And he always told me the taking off part is easy its the landing youve got to worry about.
And you believe the NLF?
And here?
And those who explode bombs in public places do they perhaps respect the law? When you asked that question to Ben MHidi remember what he said? No gentlemen believe me it is a vicious circle. And we could discuss the problem for hours without reaching any conclusions. Because the problem does not lie here. The problem is the NLF wants us to leave Algeria and we want to remain. Now it seems to me that despite varying shades of opinion you all agree that we must remain. When the rebellion first began there were not even shades of opinion. All the newspapers even the leftwing ones wanted the rebellion suppressed. And we were sent here for this very reason. And we are neither madmen nor sadists gentlemen. Those who call us fascists today forget the contribution that many of us made to the Resistance. Those who call us Nazis do not know that among us there are survivors of Dachau and Buchenwald. We are soldiers and our only duty is to win. Therefore to be precise I would now like to ask you a question Should France remain in Algeria? If you answer yes then you must accept all the necessary consequences.
Second district ...
Uh ... responsible for the sixth section.
Ill explain.
Then dont complain.
No its better if he doesnt. The house is filled with new people.
Men have two faces one that laughs and one that cries ...
Yes ... yes. The problem also involves the UN. I dont know what its worth but this way well give the UN the possibility of evaluating our strength.
Intersection between Consular Street and General Laquiere Avenue ...
Good evening sir.
A name?
She says that Ali is still in the Casbah.
Fine Charlie.  You familiar with the Marsh case?
I just wanted to introduce myself and inform Miss Lawson that there will be an inquiry.
Had to.  I also interviewed three women who were in past relationships with Marsh.  Theres no evidence that he had anything but straight sex prior to meeting Miss Lawson.
Can we put Rebecca Lawson at the scene?
A massive cardiac arrest.
We found a bottle of Dristan nasal spray on the nightstand.  It was filled with water and cocaine.  Mr. Marsh had a head cold at the time of his death.  I believe he wasnt aware that he was ingesting cocaine.
Yes  those of Mr. Marsh and a thumb print of Miss Lawsons.
It would be the same as shooting a gun at him.
Counsel approach the bench.
Marsh left her close to three million dollars in his will.  Thats motive. She admits to being there the night of his death.  Thats opportunity  and her fingerprints are on the nasal spray bottle.
Because shes clever.  Because she knows that even if we didnt find it wed have suspicions as to why a man in Marshs condition would use cocaine.
Were going all the way on this one Frank.  Tell your client she has until the prelim to cop a plea for murder two  fifteen to twenty five.
Really?  What does an attorney speak to his client about at her house until three oclock in the morning?
The States investigation just uncovered Mr. Roston yesterday afternoon in Chicago.
No.  I havent done it in years.
Thats correct  but Andrew never told me he had a heart condition.  He said he had a heart arrhythmia and it was nothing serious.
Yes.
She left me.
It was like she was trying to push me as far as she could.  She called it opening new doors.
What did she say?
She started touching herself and telling me how much she wanted me. She reached down and put me inside her.  My doctor had warned me about exerting myself  but you really dont think of those things at a moment like that.  You just think about how beautiful this woman is  how much you want her.  How deeply you want to please her.  At first it started off slowly  but the rhythm built and built.    Every time I got close to an orgasm she would stop.  Eventually I started to have trouble breathing.  Rebecca just kept going  faster and faster.  No matter what I said she wouldnt stop. I really thought for a moment I was going to die.
Yes  Insulin and others.
Cocaine.
And the argument was about the fact that you wanted to be romantically involved and she did not.
And after that didnt you continuously harass Miss Lawson?
No further questions.
No.
We dated for about a month last year.
I really dont know her that well. We would say hello to each other when I would come to the house but that was about it.
I wasnt lookin through the keyhole if thats what youre thinking.  Id come to house sometimes to pick up papers or speak to Andrew.  Id find their little toys all over the place.
No.
I was at the house one morning  I thought Miss Lawson was upstairs with Mr. Marsh.  When I went into the guest bathroom she was standing in front of the mirror pouring this white powder out of a vial.
So the woman he loved passionately was thinking about leaving.  That must cause tremendous anxiety. Sleepless nights.  Incredible stress.
So isnt it possible that he was confiding in you about the pain he was feeling about losing what might be his last chance for love?  That what he really was saying was that the uncertainty of her leaving was driving him crazy and if it didnt stop it was going to kill him.  That if she did leave his heart couldnt take it.
Well think about it.  Isnt it possible?
Would you read for us the time of the purchase?
No  Why would I want to kill him?
You didnt know about it before that?
Sorry.
And didnt Miss Lawson come home one day and find you in bed with your male lover?
I dont know.  Thats why Im asking you.
Ill have you out in a few hours.
Sure.  Where to?
Hi.  Its Frank.
I just wanted to see if my secretary called to confirm your appointment tomorrow.
Andrew loved this old cabin.  He always dreamed about moving to Tahiti  living in a hut and becoming a beachbum.  I could never imagine myself doing that  but somehow when he talked about it he made it sound so alive   so wonderful.  Soft ocean breezes and beautiful sunsets  leaving the world and its problems behind.  I wish hed had a chance to do it.
Its okay.
It wont be that hard.
No  I wanted to be a professional hockey player.
What would?
Is that what you think I was thinking?
I went out on the boat.
Are you scared?
I knew you were thinking that.  I could see it in your eyes today in the courtroom.  Youre wrong Frank. I need you to believe that.
Thats crazy.
Yeah.
I love you too Dad.
 But its Sunday.
Discourteous insinuations about his sexual abilities.  Who told you to say that?
I am relaxing.
And I suppose youre going to show me how to relax?
Were supposed to go to the lake.
He must have something or he wouldnt be pressing so hard.
Yes.
Ill talk to him later.
Charlie called at eleven thirty looking for you.  You were with her werent you?
You used to like to touch me  to make love to me.
It was a place to start.
Daddy  stop it
No  never.
Mr. Peterson are you sure mama wrote all this?
No treasure maps huh?
Aw Betty.
No. You can have them.
I have some sandwich fixings if youre hungry.
Come here a minute.
Goddamn sonofabitch I dont want to hear anymore Sonofabitch Burn the damn thing I dont want to hear it Throw it away
That would be some trick. Hes already dead. Thats what this other letter is.  From his attorney. He left most of his things to mama and requested... 
I dont know. Im completely in the dark here. Thats what I get for moving away.
This is crazy. She waits till shes dead to tell us all this. Well I got news for you. She was my mother. Thats enough for me. I dont have to know who she was.
Oh he did not. Hes such a nice guy.
You mean  she didnt like sex?
Was this during Betty?
Did we want to?
What gets me is Im 46 years old. Ive been in this crummy fucking marriage 
No. What a tragedy. What happened?
Oh honey. Im so sorry. But youve got to be grateful for even feeling the little youve be given. Believe me. Go to him. Dont let him leave without these new precious hours youve got left. And if you need anyone to cry on you know where I am.
No of course not. Ill just clean up.
Oh terrific. Which way?
No.
Oh yeah Bari. Ive been there.
No Im not.  I dont know why I said that. Ive been in a very... strange mood all day. Ive never done anything like that before. Its... Im just...  Well you know the whole world is just going nuts.
Clean?
I feel so embarrassed.
Sure. Men cook. We dont all eat bananas with our feet ya know.
My children. And Richard didnt like my working.
I dont know. Ive never thought about it... what was the most exciting place youve ever been to? Unless youre tired of talking about it.
No. Its all right. I just meant it might be a little dull for you telling all this to some housewife in the middle of nowhere.
Umm I dont know. I can look it up.
No I think I need everyone I love people. I want to meet them all I just think there are too many out there saying This is mine. or Shes mine. Too many lines have been drawn. Worlds breaking apart because of mans weakness for some testosterone conquests over territory and power and people. He wants control over what deep down he knows he has no control over whatsoever and it scares him silly.
No.
Not everybodys supposed to have a family.
The light was fading. Huhhuh.
Oh hi. Look Im running a little late but Ill still...
Yes thatd be nice.
No. I cant. Not yet.
How about Bari?
Why?
Near the church.
What?
Well what is this?
To do what? Be with someone who needs everyone and no one in particular? I mean what would be the point. Would you pass the butter?
I dont want you to say anything. I dont need you to say anything.
No ones asking you to
What about us? What about me?
But now that you have it 
Yes. And Ive accepted.
Nah.

Alright.  Yes sir.  Anything you say.
Maurice man shut the fuck up.
Saw Bones ol Bones on top of the hill. Rolling fat jays outta hundred dollar bills.
Thats the only way well get the place fixed up in time.
Lets get going.  Go home pick up what we need then crash here.
Maurice left.  Tias taking a bath.
Probably stoned out of his gourd in some corner.
Dad the man has been lying to us for a hundred years.  I mean where is my forty acres and a mule?
Whwhwhooo?

Just try it.
Ive got what I want.  Turn around baby look at me.  Look at your man.

Hush baby.
Nothing but net?  Could be a swish.  Or a muthafucking air ball.
Thats your dream Homes.  Not mine.  I dont want to leave this street.  Ever. The status quo is totally cool with me.
Aw thats easy.  I want my life back. Can you swing that my brother?
I dont want you meeting around that house.  You stay away from those kids. And away from that dog.
Who was he Momma?  He tried to kill us.
I dont.  Patrick doesnt.  And his brother and sister dont.  And theyre in the house with him.
No we wont Momma.  Ill just have them call and tell Patrick its us.
Naw.  But they will be.  Theyre the best.
My old man calls the shots.  He built that gate and these damn walls.
Bill  Bill?
Okay okay.  Listen

You got the shit?
Let me see it.
Thats the past.  Its dead.
Dad?
You cut him or I shoot you.  Make your choice.
I aint killed nobody.  Shall I rack em?  Play a game Lupe?
You was just doing your job.
Shit that was fast.
But 
Whattaya think?  Can you picture it? Over there the bar and in here  the dance floor.
The Gangster of Love dont eat no fried chicken.
That building?
Evidence of what?
What we have to do is call the police.
Ill have whatever Violets drinking.
Two point one seventysix.
All right  Wheres the key?
The same way you did before.
Ask Johnnie  Ask your ratfuck son
Im sorry.  It was an accident.
Theres no time.
What are you drunk?
Caesar I know Johnnie.  It was him. I screamed when I saw him.  I couldnt believe I missed them.  I knew you were going to be upset so I thought Id apologize and give Gino the Scotch.  I honked a couple of times but he didnt stop.
I mean it Caesar forget Johnnie forget the money lets just go now before its too late 
Dont tell him 
Caesar stop acting like an asshole and think 
You need the money just like we do.
Everything you couldnt.
Ha  What a load of crap.  Look at yourself Caesar.  Youre a thug. You launder money for the mob.  You rent women like you rented this apartment.
Shut up
Im listening.
Yes I understand.
Sure Gino sure.
No.
Hey Mickey.
What?  They aint there?
Okay.  Let me call around.  Ill see what I can do.  Dont go anywhere okay?
Yeah thats it.
Ssh  I cant hear Gino
All right.
...  thank you.
Rajeev the man who usually works on the building.
No it isnt your fault.  The walls here are just so thin.
That is so amazing.  Im in awe of people who can fix things.  My dad was like that.  We never had anything new.  Whenever something broke he would open it up tinker with it and it would work.  His hands were magic.
No.  Mr. Bianchinni asked me to do it.  I did it.
...  yes.
Im already in your bed.
Nothing.
Shit here we go.
Let me guess.  This is where you tell me that what matters is on the inside.  That inside you there is a little dyke just like me?
What are you saying?  That you dont have sex with men?
For Christs sake Violet  I heard you  Thin walls remember?
Do you think you know me like that?
Yeah.
Not much really.  Caesar was nervous kept cleaning the apartment.  The first time he picked out the dress he wanted me to wear.
The plane is in at seven so Id say about eight.
Waiting in the apartment next door.
Not Caesar.
What happened?
You dont quit on me Violet and I wont quit on you.
Im here arent I?
Jesus Christ Pop.  You got two hours until your plane leaves.
Pop this is important to me.  Its a simple question.  if he would just answer the question thats the end of it.
Violet its Gino and Johnnie.  They were in a car accident.
I told you the family doesnt want the police around.  We want to take care of it ourselves and we will. Ill find him.  I swear I will.
I dont know what were talking about.
I thought you were never going to do that.
Im assuming were exploring that possibility.
 if we can get a clean shot 
What do you want to do?
So its time to go home.
Jason...  They cant let you go...
MPG Capital.
Yes.  I mean I think so.  Yes.  Yes...
Right.
Right.  Yes.  Of course.

Excuse me?
Get me out of here.  uPleaseu.

Then Ill find another ride.
I was shot twice in the back.
I fought my way out of an embassy. I climbed down a fiftyfoot wall  I went out the window and I was doing it  I just did it.  I knew how to do it.
I cant believe I slept.
Thanks for the ride.
Nah...  With you I mean youd probably just forget about me right?

Machines dont fix themselves.

Then perhaps you can help me. Ive lost someone who ...
I understand this concern on behalf of the taxpayers. People want value for money and a costeffective service.
Mr Helpmann. Ive changed my mind. Id like to accept the transfer  am I too late?
Sam if youve been going out there and playing a straight bat all the way down the line youve got absolutely nothing to worry about.
Even later.
Really?  God how time flies
Thanks. Are you officer 412L?
Not much.
So how ...?
You didnt know as much about this business as you pretended to did you?

He hadnt done anything ... He was good ... What have you done with his body?
I ... uh ...

Yes theres more bits of paper in Central Services than bits of pipe  read this fill in that hand in the other  listen this old system of yours could be on fire and I couldnt even turn on the kitchen tap without filling in a 27B6.... Bloody paperwork.
Why? I came into this game for adventure  go anywhere travel light get in get out wherever theres trouble a man alone. Now theyve got the whole country sectioned of and you cant move without a form. Im the last of a breed. Ah ha Found it  Theres your problem.

Youre going to live.
She said to me I love the way you talk on the radio.
Whats his name?
Whatd you mean IB Bangin? What kind of name is IB Bangin?
Oh man Bucky.
I know him. Thats Noel.
Its not so rare. He grew up on our street. Hes had a rough life and hes a little crazy from it but thats no excuse for not giving someone a lousy cup of water.
You never know.
At least hes got people around him.
Go home. Take her home. Get some rest. Not going to find anything out now.
Its okay. Theyre prescription.  Works better with a little whiskey.
She should go home.
I was just going to get some food. Pizza. Maybe we could.
I grew up on Elizabeth. I went to Blessed Sacrament.
We moved out after that. Upstate.
Im all right. I just cant stand to see people tied up.  Im in the waiting room for hours listening to Noel screaming. The only reason hes screaming is cause hes tied up.
Dont say that. I wanted to cut my father loose too. They told me he almost died and five minutes later they say hes better and I go in. Its killing me seeing him fighting like that.  Look since youre here maybe you could do me a favor. I need you to wait for me outside this building okay? I have to visit a friend whos sick.
We can still go back. Ill walk you home. You sleep a couple of hours watch some TV take a bath.
No no.
Frank.
The ghosts
Make a left here. I want to stop.
Shes the daughter of a cardiac arrest I brought in last night. I told her wed give her a ride back to Misery. Her fathers showing signs of improving.
Thanks.

Heres to the greatest job in the world.
Crazy fucker.
Upstairs. 212. Had to shock him twice more.
How can that be? He was getting better.
Look out
I feel the need the need for speed. Im driving out of myself.
Ive taken that into consideration.
As long as we keep moving. No standing still.
You need a reason Frank. You dont just go around breaking peoples windows. Thats anarchy.
Frank
I eat. I just havent had coffee yet.
Its Mr. Oh. Im not answering it.
Its not our job to taxi drunks around.
You have no sick time Frank. No time of any kind. Everyone knows that.
You sure?
No Its three oclock. That can only mean one thing.
Same old stuff.  Im watching a man who won three Overseas Press Awards pitch an hors doeuvre idea.
Yes Aaron.  I know the names of the Cabinet.
Oh God no
Why?  What did they do to you?
Yes.  And Im sorry that theyre sending you down for a while but youll make it back...Where they sending you?
No.  I dont know how much fun it will be when Martin Klein and Ernie have to drop off their credentials with the security guard.
Are you any closer to a decision?
Yes.
Yes.
Office Bimbo.  No Im sorry.
Eleven and a half.
If we dont get to their camp soon we wont be able to tape the supplies coming in.
Thanks.  The F14 is one of the most difficult planes to master.  Oh you call them Tomcats and in the 70s the first crop had a number of crashes.
I didnt know you were going with him.
Could you at least pretend that this is an awkward situation for you  me showing up while youre getting ready for a date.
You didnt see it or speak to anybody?
I lost six pounds...
Im not kidding.
I dont know.  At a certain point it was so off the chart bad  it got funny.  My central nervous system was telling me something. Jane  sweat running down my face  makeup falling into my eyes  people turning this fusillade of blow dryers on me  all so I could read introductions to other people who were covering stories which is what I like to do anyway.  And Im chipper because you finally showed up.  I thought Id cook for us. Tequila and eggs sound good?
This isnt friendship.
Stop.  Ernie thought I was good too  he couldnt help.  My agent has a hot prospect  the number two station in Portland.  The general manager says he wants to be every bit as good as the networks.  Personally I think he should aim higher.
Well  my wife got this new job...
In other times for other purposes there might be a band and bunting here at the bus depot for J.D. Singers return from war.  He...
Its been a while since you read the news  Ill have somebody work with you.  Just on superficial performance things.
No.  I think anyone who puckers their lips and presses it against his boss buttocks and then smooches is an ass kisser.
Bill...This is hard on all of us and its no time for compliments. But I think its extraordinary of you to come down here for this.
Yes.
No Im not.  Im the fourth. Joan Richmond.  Pauline Fredericks got that credit once on a U.N. special and theres Susan Zirinsky.
Right there Bobbie.
Bobbie please.
I know...I mean you didnt do anything special for me tonight.  You just had what I think are good manners decency. And it really makes me want to be nice back and it has nothing to do with any homosexual thing.  Honestly.  Because I dont know if youve homosexual or not and  youre not are you?
Ones enough.
Thanks a lot Buddy.
Thats okay.
Okay.
Hey okay.  Look Buddy  Ive got to go to work.
No.  Theyre firing even more people than they said.  Some will want to talk.  It could help.
Okay thats your opinion.  I dont agree.
No its awful.  Oh my its awful.
Yes sure.
Uhhuh.
Really a lot appreciate it...
I just got back  I dont know which end is up.
Yes.
Billion.
Excited.
Well Ill go in and have a bite.
Im not sure Id be good company tonight.
Eventually.  Does it have to be right now?
Jane yes.  Tom?  Tom is that you? Is this Tom?
Says who?  Not important  hahaha. I was dreaming  Oh no  cant tell  how embarrassing for me. Gosh.
Nooo.  Is it your story?
It moved me.  I did relate to it  I really did.  It was unusual for you to cut to yourself when you tear up  and that might not have been my choice...but its real and it got me...and I think a lot of the time Im too conservative about that kind of stuff.  Okay?
Uhuh.
Three...I just thought of a third... If you talk about it you dont have to do it.
Good...Another is youre trying to make it all about sex and heat and nothing else.
Okay great Grunick  Easy shots now  huh?  Good night.
I saw the taped outtakes of the interview with the girl.  I know you acted your reaction after the interview.
Of course its the reason.  Its terrible what you did.

You want to come?
Go ahead  what?

I went way out of my way to be very helpful and courteous to that kid. Hes weak hes incompetent. He jeopardizes the whole place. Theres not much more I can do for him.
Well its a little too early. Id say Thursday would be good. Ill know by then. Is that all right?

No I  I... mean...  that can grow as I  as long as theres a mutual respect... that kind of thing can grow. Im realistic. I can accept that. But you know what is... What is love anyway?  Its a... its a mutual respect. Its  its a devotion. Its a... its a caring from one person to another. And if we could set up some kind of foundation...  based on that mutual respect...  I feel that eventually you would care enough about me... that I could live with that.
Okay.
Its nice isnt it?
But as much as they loved her...
Yeah.
No he didnt.
You know what Ace? I dont give a shit Im gettin out of here.  I am.
I dont need one.

Kincaid got a little frisky last night...So meet here at eight and go from there?  By the way Im Brock Leviathan.
What did you think?
Youre very special. Selina Im not a very good liar. I feel very strongly about you...forgive me use of architecture metaphors but I instantly know a good foundation when I see one..
Uh Brock today you are without me...
What did you say?  Selina sit down the entire city is going crazy...You have to just calm down...
Well hunt him down together...
I lied.
They do take their time. So..Selina Kyle...
Quiet Blender Boy. I told you from the beginning Selina Im not a very good liar. I am not Captain God or whatever else he may be calling himself this month but when I find out who isThe Man will pay.  My sister died in that Museum attack. You can check the Atlanta obituaries. Ive tracked these monsters from city to city waiting for a time to exact my revenge. Why else would I come to Oasisburg and create the most obnoxious casino in the world?
I guess we did. When you were a little boy did you want to be a superhero?
Oh come on Cactus be a man  The blimp is still on schedule right?
At this point a nap. Oh by the way I killed your butler and your dog..
Ive been thinking. Ive been thinking about us. Im sorry Ive been so hard no you these past couple days. I realize now its because youre the only woman who ever understood me and I couldnt handle it  Ive never revealed myself to anyone the way I have to you. Lets blow this town together.  Well run a bedandbreakfast in Vermont by day and by night well dress up and kill anything that...
I dont know what I was saying. I totally phoned it in last night. I havent been getting a lot of sleep lately...
What did you say?
Yeah...pretty gross. Hurry weve got work to do.
I got her...
Absolutely.
I hate it when you get like this. This Catwoman is becoming an obsession. I say we call it a night. Tomorrow is a big day for us...
Just like a woman. You want out. Youre out.
I know.
Oh please sir one more. Are you the reporter or the architect?
Do you have any idea how much superheroes get paid?  Zilcho. Urban vigilantes with secret identities operating outside the law. Not exactly the stuff of a W2 form.  If it wasnt for merchandising and corruption and these diabolical missions...There is no such thing as heroes and villains anymore Selina.  There are only winners and losers. You lost. We won.
Men huh?
You Career girls have no idea what we go through.
Prebicentennial babe?
Can I be frank Frank?  Your entire existence is sexual harassment. I accept theres not much you can do about it.
What is it with women and Catwoman? Men have the courtesy to punish the weak but women love punishing the strong. Dont get me wrongthis Catwoman is a terrifying subversive menace to everything this community stands for and she must be stopped. Its just I like her a lot.
Well. Id let you come in but the place is a mess...
Not too cool...
Ill go out with you. Now go get me these old newspapers...
Yes Mother. Dear.
You going to talk all day?
Do I hear a womans voice?
Taking messages.
I wont let him.  He belongs to me now.  Bye sweetie.
Ill explain later.  Im sort of on hold.
You couldve made me lose my call.
I didnt hurt you.
Theo wants to talk again.
See for yourself federal agent U.S. Treasury.  On the job.
Or relieve me of it later.
I want the gun emptied.  I want to see all six slugs tossed up here. And then I want out.  Thats all. uOUTu
Look Ive got a wife.  I dont care if either of you ever get caught.
Just like they say no fucking self control.
Shit.  Theres the hotel.  You overshot the driveway.
I improved on the fucking original.
Sure  and they record your voice.  And later on we all get slammed for kidnap and murder. Thats out
Well toss it when we make the blind curve.
I was worried about you.  Both of you.
You dont understand.
You may be our only chance.  I dont know if I can do this again.
They smashed the phone.  Ive been clicking the loose wires together hoping itd make a connection.
Theyre holding my husband downstairs.
My name is Lenore Oberfeld.
No  No police.  Theyll know right away the authorities are looking for us.  Theyll kill us. Weve seen their faces.
They just walked out.  The smaller man  he must be Dominican or Haitian  he kicked me so hard. I felt a rib crack but I never made a sound.  Its starting to hurt now  real bad.  A throbbing.  I cant even take a deep breath.
Rachel  Theyre going after Rachel now  and I cant stop them.
Let me call the school  tell them not to let her go.
Even if I got there first she wouldnt go with me.
Forget about us.  Just save Rachel.
I didnt mean to open up any old wounds.
That makes two of us.
Ive lost you.  Youre gone.  I cant hear anything.
Shes gone 
Im trying to.
Its not your fault Theo.  You tried.
Even if you found us  what then?
Im not supposed to  but I do. Millions in cash and bearer bonds.
To hide it from the I.R.S.
But I guess we havent really met  have we?
When they first started questioning Jack  he answered them in that tone he usually reserves for me.  And they began beating him.  And I watched.  And I didnt feel anything ... What kind of a person am I?
I had a little encounter at the bank and our Mr. Transplant ended up under the wheels of a Chevy.
Youre all three of you in that van?
Put the man back on.
Why cant it be her?
They tortured us.  And youre going to let them have all that money?
They put their hands all over me.
Hand me the phone.
Theres no way out for you.  You have to deal with us.
A typical fuckup.
Inform him the fee is seventyfive large for your return.  All parts intact.
Ask them.
The money Nels ... ?
I was sentenced to a youth camp out here when I was fourteen.  We cleared some of these same roads.
The cop in the trunk  he could still be alive.
We cant leave him to repeat anything.
Only one way to find out.
Thats not good enough.
You wont live to see it.
Toss them  one at a time.  I dont want to lose count.
Didnt we play this scene before?
Im afraid Ive used up all my good deeds for the day.
Im self employed.  What kind of cut did the hairy one have?
Fine.  I want half.  Plus the release of the family.
Youre up on your details arent you?
There are no guarantees in this life.
Some loyalty.
Im not accepting criticism today. Now dont make me lose count. Theres already a half million in this portfolio.
My pleasure 
You pull up  collect your first installment.  Then you let the daughter go.  When she reaches me Ill dump out another third.  Same action.  I back up again  you pull forward.  Satisfy yourself its there.  Then we do it one last time.  The final exchange. And we go our separate ways.
Are you trying to panic the women?
Im tying it up in a bundle now. Where is she?
Put the girl on.
The fuck I will
And I end up in a fucking neck brace for life
Nels  Guess who?  A friendly voice from beyond the grave.
Take the 405 south.
Following which we will have a serious question and answer session with your girlfriend.
Only you udontu have a flat.
Where is this canyon house where youre supposed to hook up?
See what Dil?
Yeah?
Nice.
What would you call it?
Hi Jimmy.
I would expect he does.
Hi.
Charming.
Dont throw my clothes out the window
Yeah. I heard. You hear Jimmy?
He wants to know do I mean that.
Its a simple question.
Not in my experience.
Bloody right I do...
Scottish?
They all get the wrong idea.
Yes thank you.
You cant leave me then can you?
Jesus fucking Christ.
Yes...
Like youre concerned.
Is this an obsession of yours?
He did sometimes.
Depends what it is.
I have to talk to her Col 
You mean that?
Thats a start.
Ask to meet me again.
Know what honey?
Absolutely.
Dont be cruel.
Okay.
Kind of.
Im not sure.
Afraid so.
No. Sit down.
A girl has to draw the line somewhere 
Yes.
Look on it like a honeymoon.
Only in times of extreme stress.
You knew which man?
I suppose I tried.
Dont you want to kill me?
He asked me to see were you all right.
Let me go Dil
Love you Dil.
Anything.
Its my name Dil 
I asked you a question honey  were you there too 
And she used her tits and that cute little ass to get him didnt she?
Tell me what she wore.
Dont call me that 
Absolutely. The younger the better. Doesnt come your way much I suppose.
Well maybe youll get lucky. Someday.
A girl has to have a bit of glamour.
My pleasure.
Suits you.
What do you mean?
No way Jude. Im out.
Come on Fergie. A rehearsal.
And what if you dont?
Request permission to take the hood off Tommy.
And anyway hes seen our faces.
Because tomorrow we might have to shoot him thats why.
I understand.
Doesnt matter who he is. He is what we would call a legitimate target.
Good. So what do you think?
Nope. Not handsome at all.
So Ive noticed.
Theyre going to let that guy die. And youre going to kill me.
Okay. That nice lady. Meets me in a bar. Im saying what the fuck am I doing here anyway. She buys me a drink. She holds my hand. Im looking at her saying I dont like you bitch. But what the fuck. Maybe Ill get to understand.
How different?
Shut up would you?
Having a pint in the Rock.
Ive often wondered how you do it.
Its as simple as that?
No. Not bad. Women are trouble you know that Fergus?
Want you to do something Fergus.
If they kill me 
How can I?
Stop that talk now 
You dont know me do you?
You didnt?
People. They could be looking.
Thought you liked me bitch.
Hes a good soldier Jude.
Pretty good huh? I taught them everything they do.
I love you Adam.
Can you remember anything at all?
Its Thursday today  and its almost five  come on
Five oclock  Thursday  the Garden  its got to be something around here.
Can I really believe you this time Adam?
You mean spies and things like that?
Im sorry its just that I didnt think that you people were supposed to admit 
Thanks very much.
Mr. Bartholomew  if I had a quarter of a million dollars believe me Id know it.
You mean its just lying around someplace  all that cash?
But 
Well there you are Charles had the money with him  so whoever killed him has it  they have it
Agents.
Theres only one Dyle connected with this affair Mrs. Lampert  thats Carson.
I didnt see any point. Dyles dead.
Can I at least keep the onion soup?
None whatsoever. Please Mrs. Lampert  be careful.
Next please.
Herman Scobie. And youve never seen him before either?
Crooked? I should think youd be glad to find out I wasnt crooked.
The lunch hour. He probably worked it out in advance. He found an office that was usually left open and just moved in for the time you were here.
I didnt say anything. Will you give me those stamps?
Before we start on that do you mind handing over the stamps?
Okay  up there.
And I say maybe you both have it One more time Dyle  where is it?
Ill take that.
The army thinks he was killed in action by the Germans but I think they did it  Tex Gideon and Scobie  and your husband  because he wouldnt go along with their scheme to steal the gold. I think he threatened to turn them in and they killed him. Im trying to prove it. They think Im working with them. But Im not and thats the truth. Im on your side Reggie  please believe that.
Im no easier to live with than he was.
Why couldnt you just look at his feet?
Serious. When a man gets to be my age thats the last word he ever wants to hear. I dont want to be serious  and I especially dont want you to be.
Who?
Im sorry.
This is a ludicrous situation. There must be dozens of men dying to use my shower.
Shut the door
I keep thinking about Charles and Scobie  and the one whos going to be next  me?
But then if we sit back and wait the field should start narrowing down shouldnt it? Whoevers left alive at the end will pretty well have sewn up the nomination wouldnt you say so?
I cant very well leave without a pair of water wings.
I dont believe it.
But I do believe it  thats what I dont believe. So its goodbye Alexander Dyle  Welcome home Peter Joshua.
I was expecting you. You are American too of course.
How much is it worth?
You gave the boy quite a lot of stamps in return Monsieur Flix  are they for sale now?
And if it is?
Meaning what?
Nachurly. And that goes for Herman too.
The kid said 
Leave me alone  
But his mother 
I am Inspector Edouard Grandpierre of the Police Judiciaire. Would you be so kind as to come with me please?
I dont know.
A letter? May I see it?
Is that all? Can I go now?
And this?
Why do you think were going to?
No you see I dont really love him.
Im a simultaneous translator  like Sylvie only shes English to French  Im French to English. Thats what I did before I married Charles. The police probably think I killed him.
Not too expensive  Im not a lady of leisure anymore.
You telephoned me to meet you. Ive been standing on the corner back there  waiting for you.
Starting tonight?
Having a nervous breakdown.
Stop bullying me. Everybodys bullying me.
How do you shave in there?
How about once more around the park?
Then stop acting like one. If youre really in some kind of trouble Id like to hear about it. Otherwise its late Im tired and Im going home to bed.
Good night.
Be careful Peter.
I dont know.  Those men killed Charles to get it. But he must not have had it with him on the train.
Usually its because they want something  and theyre afraid the truth wont get it for them.
I believe what he said.
Words can hurt very much.
Please stop  please
Yes maam. A little one  bout seven or eight years old. Th little tyke keeps callin you his Aunt Reggie  aint that cute?
Until two days ago all I really knew about Charles was his name  now it turns out I didnt even know that.
Hello Reggie  I am waiting for JeanLouis.
Who invited you?
We want that money  now
Me too. Im going to start telling people that I saw her drop to her knees and latch on to his unit vector.
WOULD that impress you? IS that what it takes to impress the empress?
Not my imports.
Why not? You worried you might find out how much she actually knows?
Calm down Brent.
Hi Daddy. Hi Mr. Sisler.
You never went uh all the way?
Never mind darling. You go back to school. I dont want you missing anymore classes today.
No. Let her get at least one more peacefully nights sleep.
You know where I can find her?
I never met the woman. Im just taking care of the place until they sell it.
No pictures. No mirrors. Was she a crazy woman when you knew her?
Couldnt tell she going to off herself huh?
Yeah. You should check downstairs.
People always keep their secrets in their attics or in their basements. All the weirdness in this house took place in the basement.
Im sure you should have failed.
Of course Im scared.
I was born nine months after she was raped. One of the four men who raped her is my father. I have no idea which one.
But you cant do any of it. So it sucks. I always have to set an example.
Does she fuck?
I was desperate. It was gross.
Maybe I should blister through a bottle of Tequila and just fuck his brains out.
I keep a couple of my dads porno books hidden in my desk for emergency reference.
There will be a lot fewer by tomorrow night.
FINE. Are you?
Youre thinking of sleeping with Mark tonight?
No.
So? Youre already late. A few more minutes wont matter.
Fuck your curfew. Most sixth graders can stay out later than you.
I did.
Im so flattered but I cant. Im grounded.
Sharons far from a slut.
Hes dead Weve got to get the fuck out of here
Yes?
No but he got really weird. Like Ive never seen him act. REALLY angry and super uptight.
Whoever tried to kill me was made up to look exactly like this picture of Lisa Sherman clothes and all. I think that concerns me.
The word is Mob.
The men. Do any of them still live around here?
Youre not telling me something.
Who was the fourth?
Did you want one?
Theyre tasty.
Maybe you better just drive me home.
Yes. Unfair to me.
Sam?  Andy gave Sam a nice big desk to park his fat ass behind.

No
Theres nothing to say doctor.  Someone had to take the fall and they still need you whereas...Ive never been anything more than a thorn in their collective side as you once said.

Together you gave me the opportunity to realize just how very wrong my life had gone.

Land sales out of escrow are always recorded within the week.
Whos the investigating officer?
Do you know him?
Where from?
Of course but youve got no reason to think hes bungled the case?
Mainly that youre rich and too respectable to want your name in the papers.
His girlfriend?
You mean the little chippie he was with at the El Macando?
Yeah.
When was the last time?
Ill look into it as soon as I check out some avocado groves.
Just incorporate the Valley into the city so the water goes to L.A. after all. Its very simple.
At your daughters house. How soon can you get here?
Just bring your checkbook.
You know youre okay Mr. Gittes. I know its your job but youre okay.
Thanks. You know something Jake?
You bet your ass you dont. You cant even pay me off.
Oh gee Mr. Gittes were going out tomorrow. I know you been real good about it but my cousin Auggies sick.
Howd you get past the guards?
Uhhuh. So what are you doing here?
Who?
Didnt you call?
You accusing me of extortion?
Well I hope she wasnt too much of a disappointment to you Lou.
Shut up.  Go on.
What for?
Do me a favor will you Lou?
I guess not.
But there is no possibility he would have taken his own life?
Well yes.
I dont think so Mrs. Mulwray. Of course you have my deepest sympathy and if we need anymore information well be in touch.
I said Ill drop it.
You may if you can Mr. Gittes.
Well how much would you like?
How did you find out?
Did he know?
No. Im just a snoop.
No not for that one.
Been meaning to talk to you about that.
Money. How they plan to make it by emptying the reservoirs that I dont know.
No... Yes a little. You see Hollis and my fa... my father had a falling out...
No.
And Hollis knew about it?
They cant be.
Whats that Mrs. Mulwray?
You cant always tell whats going on there.
Please... Trust me this much...  Ill be back. Look there is something I should tell you. The fishing club that old lady mentioned the pieces off the flag.
He owns it. You know?
Thats not what it looks like Mrs. Mulwray.
Because of Hollis? Because she was seeing your husband? Was that it? Jesus Christ say something. Was that it?
...Thats not what I meant.
Im all right.
Hes in the dark room.
Whatd you expect? Thats his job.
When did you come in?
Nothing to do with Dad. Its me actually.
Of course.
We dont reveal the names of our guests as a matter of policy. I know youd appreciate that if your father came to live with us.
I dont think so. Be happy to show you.
J.J. Gittes. And its not a departmental matter.
Maybe he takes it very seriously.
Hope so. Hes working for us.
Only when I breathe.
Well look at it this way Mr. Yelburton.  Mulwray didnt want to build a dam and he had a reputation that was hard to get around so. you decided to ruin it. Then he found out that you were dumping water every night. Then he was drowned.
Nothin Morty its my lunch hour I thought Id drop by and see who died lately.
Drowned too.
Yeah under Hollenbeck Bridge whats wrong with that?
Who?
Mr. Gittes...
Yeah Ill do that.
Well Im on my lunch hour. Ill wait.
I take a long lunch. All day sometimes.
I dont want Mulvihill.  I want the big boys that are making the payoffs.
No you have a press agent do it.
She aint exactly long in the tooth now.
You must be thinking of a different daughter.
We missed the best of it didnt we pal?
So I can have these? 
I bought a ticket. Ive come to see the film. 
Then why dont you change jobs? 
For example at this moment the films out of focus. Go see.
Nothing theres nothing. Its all out of focus.
I want to make you happy Toto Im going to tell you a story.  Once upon a time a king gave a feast and there were all the most beautiful princesses of the realm. Basta one of the guards saw the kings daughter she was the loveliest of all And he immediately fell in love with her. But what could a poor soldier do compared with a kings daughter?...One day he managed to meet her and told her he couldnt live without her. The princess was so struck by the depth of his feeling that she said to the soldier  If you will wait a hundred days and a hundred nights beneath my balcony then in the end Ill be yours. Christ the soldier ran off there and waited One day two days ten twenty...Every night she looked out of her window but he never budged. Come rain wind snow never budged The birds shat on him and the bees ate him alive After ninety nights he was gaunt and pale and tears streamed from his eyes but he couldnt hold them back. He didnt even have the strength to sleep any more. The princess kept watch...And on the ninetyninth night the soldier got up picked up his chair and left
Just so Alfredo. There isnt any. And if you buy a television set you can watch it at home without any fuss...
Now I understand why the soldier went away just before the end. Thats right just one more night and the princess would have been his. But she also could not have kept her promise. And...that would have been terrible he would have died from it. So instead for ninetynine nights at least he had lived with the illusion that she was there waiting for him... 
Well talk about that later.
Thats nothing to do with it its the car thats still being run in...
The army says that as a war orphan I dont have to serve in the military but nothing can be done. Its a bureaucratic error. I have to leave. Day after tomorrow morning. Theyre sending me to Rome. But theyll discharge me ten days later. Lets go...
Of course I remember him. Im sorry. You were terribly fond of him.
Alfredo damn him He cast his spell on you too
Its not true No Its not true Ill show you hes coming back
I rather like it myself.  Send it right away.
Two cents.
Refigure it Mr. Bernstein at two cents.
I cant take shorthand Mr. Kane 
Thesell be kept.  Ill provide the people of this city with a daily paper that will tell all the news honestly.  I will also provide them 
You dont really think so?
Well why dont you Mr. Bernstein? You know Mr. Leland.
Thats a long story.
And the social.  How about the music notice?  You got that in?
Nobody else but Ive been through that stuff of Walter Thatchers. That journal of his 
I guess Mr. Kane didnt think so well of Susies art anyway.
It didnt end very well did it?
I wanted him to have fun  and with me along 
Yes.
Im all right Mr. Leland.  Only there was some fellows out front that thought they ought to take things up with me.  I learned em Didnt I officer?
Go and get yourself washed up Mr. Bernstein.  There doesnt seem to be an serious injury.
Mr. Kane is finishing it.
Mr. Kane is finishing your piece the way you started it.
I dont my plans myself.
Thats one of the things I think must be changed Mr. Carter.  The news goes on for twentyfour hours a day.
Really Mr. Kane I cant see the function of a respectable newspaper 
Thatll be all today Mr. Carter. Youve been most understanding. Good day Mr. Carter
Weve got a nice plant here.
Has he said when hell finish?
Chicago is pretty close to New York nowadays  only twenty hours 
Im surprised he got the votes he did.
Why should anyone vote for him? Hes made it quite clear to the people what he thinks of them. Children  to be told one thing one day something else the next as the whim seizes him.  And theyre supposed to be grateful and love and adore him  because he sees to it that they get cheap ice and only pay a nickel in the street cars.
Hes paying for it Emily.  Those returns tonight  hes finished. Politically    socially everywhere I guess. I dont know about the papers but 
I dont think so.  Are you coming Charles?
You decided what you were going to do Charles  some time ago.  You cant always have it your own way regardless of anything else that may have happened.  Come on Charles.
If these sidewalks were kept in condition  instead of the money going to some cheap grafter 
You are.  You look like youve been making mud pies.
Youre no Venus de Milo.
No.  But youre close.
You really dont know who I am?
Pretty old.  Ill be twentytwo in August.
Oh no  Nothing like that.  Mother always thought  she used to talk about Grand Opera for me.  Imagine An American girl for one thing  and then my voice isnt really that kind anyway its just that Mother  you know what mothers are like.
Oh you wouldnt want to hear me sing.
Thats when youve got to fight them. Thats when youve got to make them. Thats 
Half past eleven.
I was referring to myself.  I thought we might have a picnic tomorrow  it might be a nice change after the Wild West party tonight.  Invite everybody to go to the Everglades 
Youre in a tent darling.  Youre not at home.  And I can hear you very well if you just talk in a normal tone of voice.

Im not suggesting anything Mr. President  Ive come here to tell you that unless some action is taken promptly  and you are the only one who can take it  the oil that is the property of the people of this country will be turned over for a song to a gang of highpressure crooks
Thanks.
Your mother wont be going right away Charles 
Wont you step into my office Mr. Thatcher?
Theyre all part of your general attack  your senseless attack  on everything and everybody whos got more than ten cents in his pocket. Theyre 
All right.
Do you know what that is?
How would the Enquirer look with no news about this nonexistent war  with Benton Pulitzer and Heart devoting twenty columns a day to it?
Yes?
Go ahead.
Thats just a little promotion scheme. Nobody expects you   Mike will you try and get Mr. Leland some coffee?
Shes going to leave you 
Do you think the Enquirer shouldnt have campaigned against the oil leases?
Yes.
Mr. Leland sent back that check.
It was for twentyfive thousand dollars.
Rogers isnt even pretending.  He isnt just scared anymore.  Hes sick.  Frank Norris told me last night he hasnt known Rogers to be that worried in twentyfive years.
You wont be lonely Charles...
You dont happen to have a cigar do you?  Ive got a young physician  must remember to ask to see his license  the odds are a hundred to one he hasnt got one  who thinks Im going to stop smoking...  I changed the subject didnt I?  Dear dear  What a disagreeable old man Ive become.  You want to know what I think of Charlie Kane?  Well  I suppose he has some private sort of greatness. But he kept it to himself.  He never  gave himself away   He never gave anything away.  He just  left you a tip.  He had a generous mind.  I dont suppose anybody ever had so many opinions.  That was because he had the power to express them and Charlie lived on power and the excitement of using it   But he didnt believe in anything except Charlie Kane.  He never had a conviction in his life.  I guess he died without one   That must have been pretty unpleasant.  Of course a lot of us check out with no special conviction about death.  But we do know what were leaving ... we believe in something.  Youre absolutely sure you havent got a cigar?
Never mind   Bernstein told you about the first days at the office didnt he?  Well Charlie was a bad newspaper man even then.  He entertained his readers but he never told them the truth.
Its a letter from her lawyers.
That must have been love.
Ask the question anyway Thompson Build the picture around the question even if you cant answer it.
Yes sir.
Queer?
He married you didnt he?
Rosebud?
What is this a poll?
Do you mind if I drink this here?
You want me to leave? Why? Because somebody is telling it like it is? Somebodys giving these fine people a wakeup call?
Exactly.
He went home to change for the big date.
I went back there and Dante was already waiting for me.
No dont
Dante. Youve got a customer.
I cant believe youre here.
Very dramatic I thought.
Were you going to tell me or just send me an invitation?
How do you know that?
So youre really getting married?
Thanks for the vote of confidence.
What?
Jesus youre caustic.
Cute. Tell me you wouldnt want to go out again. After all the talking weve been doing.
Im just kidding.
Ill ask Randal to close up for me when he gets back.
It wasnt me.
Was it you?
Nobody. It was closed.
Were sorry maam. We got a little carried away.
I can pass
I can whip your ass.
Give me a stick pretty boy Ill knock your fucking teeth out and pass all over your ass.

Bunch of savages in this town.
Shit if Id known you were working I wouldve come even later.
What do you two fight about?
Thats cheating?
You Veronica Caitlin...  ...and Caitlins fianc.
Blasphemy.
All right Vaders boss...
Then wouldnt that logically mean that its a theocracy? If the head of the Empire is a priest of some sort then it stands to reason that the government is therefore one based on religion.
Basically.
All right so even if independent contractors are working on the Death Star why are you uneasy with its destruction?
He said he has to find a perfect dozen.
Ill give him five more minutes then Im calling the cops. I dont need this man. Im not even supposed to be here today.

Bible truth.

Exactly.
I dont you did.
I swear. I couldnt make this kind of hell up.
Because Im happy.
Im not. She just left.
Im not.
No Dont bring it up. I dont want to think about that now. Let me enjoy this hour of bliss. Ill think about all of that later. In the meantime nobody mentions the V word.
Shut the fuck up
WOULD YOU SHUT THE FUCK UP?  WHO THE FUCK IS IN THE BATHROOM?
What are you talking about?
Leave me alone.
Jesus H. Christ I cant
Point isIm not the kind of person that disrupts things in order to shit comfortably.
Which means the video store is ostensibly closed.
Unless youre out renting videos at other video stores.
Do you need a hug or something? Cause I would have no hangups about hugging you... you know you being a guy and all. Just dont knead my ass when you do it.

The guy got sick and couldnt come in.
Yes And Im going to play like shit because I didnt get a good nights sleep
Nothing Jesus I gotta fight with you now?
Whos defensive?  Just... Would you just hug me? All right? Your boyfriend was accosted by an angry mob and he needs to be hugged.
Why do you say that?
Yeah right. You cant get enough of me.
Three including you.
I am. And thats why you should feel like a pig. You men make me sick. Youll sleep with anything that says yes.
After dropping a bombshell like that you owe me. Big.
Sylvan made it up. Its a blow job thing.
Yeah. How do you think I know he liked...
Please calm down.
Lower your voice
Um. Thirtyseven.
Peanut butter and jelly with the crusts cut off. What do you think it is? Its lasagne.
At least he wasnt thirtysix.
Im not the one trying to patch things up with my ex sneaking around behind your back And if you think that thirtyseven dicks are a lot then just wait mister Im going to put the hookers in Times Square to shame with all the guys I go down on now
I dont want Caitlin...
I dont want to go back with her...
Veronica I love you...
Can I have your name please?
An angry mother called the state division of taxation and complained that the man working at Quick Stop Convenience sold her fiveyearold daughter cigarettes today at around four oclock. Division of taxation calls the State Board of Health and they send me down here to issue a fine. You say you were working all day hence the fine is yours.  Its doubled due to the incredibly young age of the child.
Hes moving to the big city next week. He wants to be a metal singer.
I dont know. I cant really tell from here.
My exboyfriend was about his height but he was much bulkier. He could bench twofifty three hundred easy.
Your ruse. Your cunning attempt to trick me.
Youre gonna be at John Ks party?
Pretty much. All except the latent homosexuality partthats just my theory.
Dont hold it against him. He just never got Caitlin out of his system. Its not your fault. Its Dante.  I dont know thing one about chicks. Do you want to cry or something? I can leave.
Um do you think you can give me a lift home tonight?
You came for that too? Thats the movie I came for.

I was with Jessie she filled me in.
When we get this group down Im gone.
And you werent looking into her eyes when she fell.  Now drop it
Would you?
Give him the money.
Not on that leg.
Thats it you look like a professional.
Patience my love patience.
Wait I think I have them sighted.  Whats the word Frank?
Dont say that.  Youll embarrass Frank.
Did I?  I dont know.  Maybe I shouldnt have gone out on that line.  Maybe I panicked.
I dont expect you to understand.
You couldnt.
Why are you yelling?
Flare up of old emotions...
No I think I will its safer. I have patience.
He doesnt want my help.
He can handle it.
You got to go back now
Excuse me?
Of course I do.

The best he can since you gave him nothing.
No hes gone.
Were not animals but dont force us to be.  Walk over.
Im touched.  Kristel check the chopper lets go.
What are you talking about?
Tucker and Walker.
It looks like a winding route.
Then its a deal.
On my way.  The cases are hooked up and ready.
Somehow I didnt think youd wait for me if Id sent it first.
Lets move your ass in there
I havent even got on it yet.  Lets go time to fetch.
Then go fetch.
Hey you dealt us this hand were playing it all the way. Move.
No that sonofabitch Walker is alive.
A nozh scrap any time you say. Dim weakens.
You bastards... bastards.
And you sir?
Thank you sir.
Who are they sir?
How do you do sir?
I understand that you had a rather unfortunate encounter with the Police tonight.
Bit of pain in the gulliver Mum. Leave us be and Ill try to sleep it off... then Ill be as right as dodgers for this after.
Alright Mum... have a nice day at the factory.
To what do I owe this extreme pleasure sir? Anything wrong sir? Deltoid playfully grabs Alexs hair.
Thats just worries me. A bit too long to long to be reasonable. Youre about due now by my reckoning thats why Im warning you little Alex to keep your handsome young proboscis out of the dirt. Do I make myself clear?
That is correct sir. And then all I can think about is like trying to snuff it.
Brother you think and talk sometimes like a little child. Tonight we pull a mansize crast.
Come come come Georgie Boy. Youre a big strong chelloveck like us all. Were not little children are we Georgie Boy? What then didst thou in thy mind have? Confrontation. Georgie backs down.
Thank you very much. Thank you my dear. Girl bows and exits to loud applause.
Was I alright sir? Did I do well sir?
I can tell you that I... and the Government of which I am a member are deeply sorry about this my boy. Deeply sorry. We tried to help you. We followed recommendations had been made to us that turned out to be wrong. An enquiry will place the responsibility where it belongs. We want you to regard us as friends. Weve put you right youre the best of treatments. We never wished you harm but there are some that did and do and I think you know who those are. There are certain people who wanted to use you for political ends. People who would have been glad to have you dead because then they would have been able to blame it all on the Government. I think you know who those are. There is also a certain man  a writer of subversive literature  who has been howling for your blood. Hes been mad with desire to stick a knife into you but youre safe from him now weve put him away. He found out that you had done wrong to him  at least he believed you had done wrong. He had formed this idea in his head that you h
You must have an interesting job at a salary which you would regard as adequate. Not only for the job which you are going to do and in compensation for what you believe you have suffered but also because you are helping us.
Well. That was all took away son by the Police. New regulation about compensation for the victim.
Well all this needs thinking about son. I mean we cant very well just kick Joe out... Not just like that can we? I mean Joe is here doing a job. A contract it is two years. Well we made like an arrangement didnt we Joe? You see son Joes paid next months rent already so well whatever we do in the future we cant just say to Joe to get out now can we?
Why do you say that brother? I had a shower this morning.
Sorry brother. I didnt mean any offence.
Right carry on. Alex tosses a bar of chocolate on the desk.
One half bar of chocolate. One bunch of keys on white metal ring. One packet of cigarettes. Two plastic ball pens  one black one red. One pocket comb  black plastic. One address book  imitation red leather. One ten penny piece. One white metal wristlet watch Timawrist on a white metal expanding bracelet. Anything else in your pockets?
Shut your bleedin hole
Howre you feeling this morning?
What exactly is the treatment here going to be then?
I just dont understand about feeling sick the way I did. I never used to feel sick before. I used to feel like the very opposite. I mean doing it or watching it I used to feel real horrorshow. I just dont understand why how what.
Fine. Fine.
Psychiatrist? Huh do I need one?
Thats right and Ill smash your face for you yarblockos. Slide of watch shop.
Excuse me missus. No time for the old inout Ive just come to read the meter. Slide of birds nest with eggs.
Fine. Well thats all there is to it. Are you alright?
Yes.
Good. Im glad
Oh thankyou your honour. The Tramp takes a second look at Alex.
Certainly my son certainly. Is there something troubling you my son? Dont be shy to speak up. Remember I know all the urges that can trouble young men deprived of the society of women.
The question is weather or not this technique really makes a man good. Goodness comes from within. Goodness is chosen. When a man cannot chose he ceases to be a man.
Be patient my son and put your trust in the Lord.
Prison custody?
Very good Chief. Chief Guard turns to Alex.
I agree sir. What we need are larger prisons. More money.
No no no. Thats enough. Hes perfect. I want his records sent to me. This vicious young hoodlum will be transformed out of all recognition.
What?
I used to play this piece back in high school.
Different instrument altogether.  You know if youd only listened to me wed be bogged down in traffic right now and you could have made yourself an extra five bucks.
You psychic?
Just had one.
Sure thing.
Max?  Oh...  ...its kind of a strange time to be calling...
It doesnt matter  Just get out of the goddamn building...
In my office?
Seventh files section.  What should I do?
Max Im scared.  Are you sure?
You heard Armstrong play live.  Ive never been this jealous.  You get to talk to him?
Fella owned this place back then Dix Dwyer he let slip to Louis that I played.  So Pops he just waves me right up.  My heart about stopped. But I got up there all the same and we played for nearly twenty minutes.
I never lie.  Ask Max.  Max have I lied yet?
Cant say that I do.
I think...  ...I think you should get this gun out of my fucking face.
Wouldnt dream of it.
Pretty quiet down there.  A cab just pulled up aside from that...
...Petrov and Cicerno for sure...
So?
No.  Your cabbie is floating down a storm drain or stuffed in the trunk of a cab.
Oh we working for the Feds now?  If my snitch flew out a window hes got Dmitris handprints on his ass. That makes it homicide that makes it ours.
Oh?
Pick me up in five minutes.
Not our call Phil.
What happens if you dont?
Who the hell is this?
...well last I checked you were usleepingu with me so unless you wanna start fucking the guy soon Id suggest an attitude shift...
You share it with over three million people every day.  You know thats the population of New Zealand?  Whats Manhattan thirteen miles long? Thats a lot of misery crammed into thirteen miles.  Read about this one guy.  Gets on the subway and dies.  Six hours hes riding around before anybody notices. Think about that.  Heres this corpse doing laps around Manhattan courtesy of the New York transit system people getting on and off sitting next to him and still nobody catches on. Three million.  Thats too damn many people.
You mean like benefits?
Yeah.  Lucky with the lights.
Two twofifty.
You always stutter?
Youre cool.
Yeah.
...and you promise youll never tell anybody about this right?  Get in the fucking car.
Yes  Im trying I swear
How can you kill him like that?
You dont know the guy in the trunk either.  If it makes you feel better he was a villain involved in a Continuing Criminal Enterprise.
Ill deal with it.  I will I will...
Why?
It was an accident.  Im not liable.
I need the job.
What?
I dont understand...
You mind?  Im working here.
Leave me alone.
uI dont wanna know youu
Oh Im captivated.
Youd do her a favor.
She hears what she wants to hear okay?
Yeah?  What happened?
What happened?
See Ive got bills.  My mothers been dying of the same disease since I was a kid.
Why?
Makes two of us.
Tribeca near the waterfront northeast corner.  Twelve minutes.
I only owe you a ride Vincent.
That cop  Whyd you have to do that?  You couldnt wound him?  The guy had a family maybe parents kids who gotta grow up without a dad he was probably a good guy and he believed me...
Yeah so whats wrong with that?
What happened to you?
Man if someone had a gun to your head and said  You gotta tell me whats goin on with that person over there or Ill kill you...theyd have to kill you...  Cause you dont have a clue for...or about...anyone...  To be like that I dont think you you have any of that for your own life...  Do you believe youre entitled or at least expect to draw breath in the a.m.?  Open your eyes in the morning?  I dont think you do...I dont think so...  I think you are way ulowu...like in your estimation.  In your estimation of yourself.  So howd you get that way...?
None of your business.
Slow down.
What are you gonna do pull the trigger?  Kill us?  Go ahead man uShootu...my ass.
Guy came in with a gunshot wound but he died of a heart attack.  Go figure.
Not testing.  uUsingu.  Nukes are passe.  This is the weapon of the future.
I cant promise you anything.
Ill see you tomorrow.
Sure.  You switched the charts didnt you?
For what?
Dont tell me youre naked back there.
Do they have a secret handshake?
Im not sure.  I think I figured something out.  It mustve been in my newsletter.
Flesh wound.  No big deal.
Can you prove any of this?
Just five.  Its the economy... You think maybe one of them is not who they seem?
Just a guy trying to put out a fire.
Jerry theres something I have to ask you.  Actually about a hundred things but we can make progress if you answer one question.  To my satisfaction.
It made me feel like you could see inside of me.  And I dont know how thats possible.
What van?
Ill be fine.  Lets worry about Henry Finch.  P.O. Box in St. Louis.  Hes the last on the list. I havent been able to reach him yet.
Realized what?
So now they feed us terrorists. uTo create fearu.  How much do you think an airport security system goes for?  Then multiply it by every airport in the country.
Latest casualty?  Ernest Harriman. You heard of him?
A water main broke.
If thats what you want.  Yes.
I like you Jerry.  A lot.
Dont do this to yourself.  Jerry. You dont love me.
No.  That wouldnt be fair.  Where are we going Jerry?
This way.
You go.  Send me a postcard.
He gave it to me.
Jerry...?  uJerryu.
I spent two years here.  This used to bring the medcart.  Demerol. Phenobarb.  Its Jacobs Ladder.
Now she tells me.
Youve never seen her run.
Then I cant be hurt anymore.
Well I dont know if 
I dont know...
Alright.  You can see her.  But she cant see you.
It was my dog.  Let me ask you a question.  How long have you been acquainted with Jerry?
Youve asked me that one three times.
Excuse me?
Were very specialized.
Yes thats right.
I know the story.  A federal judge.  He denied a man in prison an appeal for a new trial.
I dont understand.
Working.
Too bad.  Because Im terrible at yes.
What do I look like to you? Switzerland?
Do you uhaveu an Agent Lowry in your New York office?
This doesnt make sense.
Its his show for now.  Look you want to get some dinner?  Inter Agency cooperation and all?
You think we have time to fool around like this?  Come on.
I dont think so.
Yes sir.
Yes sir.
Okay fine theyve got the primes  but if youre right about there being another more significant transmission still to come 
How is that possible?  How could all that information be encoded in 
Dr. Drumlin we are talking about what could potentially be the most important discovery in the history of humanity.  There are over four hundred billion stars out there 
What if youre wrong?  No  Ill grant you probabilities but as a scientist without all the evidence  you cant deny the possibility  and I believe even the remotest possibility of something this profoundly... profound is worth investigation  and worth taking a few risks.
No thanks.
Goddamnit they are out there David 
David 
With me.
Im going to convert Mr. Scienceis therootofallevil?  This is absurd David.  We have work to do here I dont have time to play babysitter to the God Squad.
Interesting analogy.  And how guilty would we feel if we happened to destroy some microbes on a beach in Africa?
Maybe they are.  Maybe this is all part of the package.  The building of the machine has demanded international cooperation on an unprecedented scale.  Maybe requiring us to come together in this way was in effect part of the plan.
This... seemed best.
Good luck David.
What would you have me say David?
It could be anything.  The first volume of some Encyclopedia Galactica...
How soon will you be able to decode it?
Yes  of course  all Im saying is this message was written in the language of science  mathematics  and was clearly intended to be received by scientists.  If it had been religious in nature it should have taken the form of a burning bush or a booming voice from the sky...
In ancient times when parchment was in short supply people would write over old writing... it was called a palimpsest.
Weve repeated.  A few minutes ago the message cycled back to page one.
I dont know.  Maybe there is a fourth layer in there somewhere but if there is I sure as hell cant find it.
Been there done that got the Tshirt.
Kent Kent for Chrissakes.  You must be Eleanor.
Its a civilian facility.
Its incredibly rich.  Weve been cataloging it in frames or pages right now were on 10413.
You dont seem to understand that its your interests Im trying to protect  
Is that your official response?
Big enough radio I dont see why not.
Im sorry I couldnt be there for you sweetheart.
The librarian... or the library...?
I find it convenient to keep my interests... mobile.  Anyway Ive had my fill of life on the ground. After spending much of this century pursuing the evils and pleasures the world has to offer  after outliving three wives and two children...  I find Ive had quite enough of planet Earth.
Ive had a long time to make enemies Dr. Arroway.  There are many governments business interests even religious leaders who would like to see me disappear. And I will grant them their wish soon enough... But before I do I wish to make a small contribution  a final gesture of goodwill toward the people of this little planet whove given  from whom Ive taken so much.
Its so... small.
Cant.  Doctors orders.  The low oxygenzero gravity environment is the only thing keeping the cancer from eating me alive.  Its all right  I like it here. Ever try sex in zeroG?
And?
Ellie... even if you do manage to raise the money have you thought about what it would really mean to follow through on this?  I mean a college fetish is one thing but were talking about your career. You wont be publishing.  You wont be taken seriously... and you could spend your entire life looking and never find anything at all.
Thirtyone linked dishes.  You could search more sky there in a day than you could in a year here.
Actually 
That is true.  But its also true that if I really thought we wanted the same things Id follow you anywhere... but the truth is I dont think you want the company.  Be honest El.  Theres nowhere youd rather be than sitting out at some remote corner of the world searching for the answers to the mysteries of the universe.  And call me crazy but I just cant compete with that... Im sorry.
You too.
Wait  hold on a minute 
Thats one way of putting it.  Kitz the President the I.S.C. have shut down all official communications thereve also been reports of riots flaring up across the U.S. and Europe.  Until we figure out what went wrong things may get rough especially for you 
Thats not faith its physics.  The second law of thermodynamics.
Some of my best friends are scientists.  Theyre saying the machine is alive.
If you came back.
Thank you.
Im sorry.
Im sorry  I cant 
It was quite a page turner.
Im not sure its come to that.
Have you seen whats happening out there?  The terror the despair? The world is on fire Ellie.  People need something they can believe in something worthy and you can give it to them
Maybe what you experienced cant be reduced to images on a videotape. Maybe they still plan to grant your request only in their own way in their own time... Or maybe its just like you said  ultimately their motives may be as incomprehensible as their technology.
Does that mean you think it doesnt exist?
Meaning...
Nobody is proposing we censor the truth here Doctor.  Were simply talking about putting a mechanism in place 
I got two years.
We allus thought you was strong enough to carry it. Was we wrong?
What are you doin here?
Tried to live always just as free and aboveboard as you been and well they aint that much elbow room.
Gotta go Arletta.
Ram it in and break it off
Yeah. Did you have them both at once or

Fiftys a nice round number.
Nothin to worry about. We got a deadlock on that mullet.
We got it locked in the sock.
Yeah well you and Koko kin handle it without me.
On my own.
Hes the champeen hoggut of this camp. Hell I seen him eat ten choclat bars and seven cold drinks in fifteen minutes. He kin eat busted bottles and rusty nails any damn thing. If youd so kindly oblige as to let me cut off your yankee head hed even eat that.
Fortyfive.
Gettin up Carr.

Well how far didya get?
A phoney? Whatta you mean a phoney?
Hell no. I aint goin down in the ditch.
Andy?  When a threeyearold says theres a monster under the bed you dont say forget it.  You look under the bad.  Im three years old.  Call the prison.
Monsieur Andy can usmellu your coiffure.  And guess what else?
You talked to me.  Do you remember?
Inspector Halloran.  Homicide. You were supposed to contact a Peter Kurten?
Shut up  Im talking.  You got felony breaking and entering burglary felonious...
You get me out first.
What Friday?
Im trying to tell you.  Its on the ladys pillow...
He told you she was loaded any thing you could steal you could keep Conrad?  You bought yourself a return ticket to Quentin breaking and entering.
She dont want it.
You come and visit.
Conrad has the phone number. Conrad where is he?
I dont care  shes a cop.  Thats the important thing.  Copness not sexness.  It wont be perfect but itll be good.
Thats not who I admire  I admire people who are good at what they do great artists writers thinkers...
I think this is number three...
Is he out?
If you knew why you might know where to look for him. I dont envy you this hes not done  hes going to do them faster and faster to keep the adrenaline rush.  Now Ive done what you asked me.
Show what?  Its gone.  He wrote a self destruct virus into the code so it would only play until we try to copy it.  Then it erased itself. Gone...  Do you remember what you saw?
Nobody knows you have anything to do with this case nothing has been on TV or the news... Why would he want to get in uyouru computer?
Youre saying its the same man but hes changed his style?  That doesnt happen.  These men are robotic the murder is like a ritual.  The method itself is part of the pleasure...
I turned it off.  Its like an open window he can climb right in...
That little Winona Ryder manner... youre more convincing as Clint Eastwood.
Whos going to catch him?  You?  And if you do therell be another one.  And one after that.
One of those goddamned car alarms. Whats going...
He said to send you his regards and to tell you that the Bureau holds you in the highest esteem.
What does it matter?  This guy you checked your course records who signed up?
Look.  Theres the order  you wrote it  DeSalvo Bianchi  Buono Berkowitz and Dahmer.  Its going to be Dahmer next.  Which means hell kill a man.
WWe had a fight.  I called him... called him a name...
They never kill themselves.  How do you know it was him.  You never met him.  You never even saw a photograph...
No.  Im shy and Im selective.
I know baby.  I know.
He wants me he doesnt care about her.  Let me...
You got that right Nikko its none of your business.
Yeah you did that too.  You earned what you got dont shit on it thats all Im saying.
Im sure she thinks it is.  Arent you at least interested in which one it is?
Its mostly done they got nobody in common the three of them... No mutual friends  the Landlady says nobody was ever there she never saw her with anybody.
Classy madonna.
Honest to God Ruben
Why would he send this to Helen Hudson...
Excuse me?  uExcuse meu?  What do you...
Dont try to lie Ruben.  You dont have the face for it.  I need you to help interrogate the burglar in Hudsons place...
I gotta get something to eat I havent eaten all day.
The same as the firs two. Definitely a serial.
Thats always your privilege sir.
What?  I talk like a cop this is the way I talk.  I cant believe this guy.  Saks.  Hes a Deputy Assistant Director of the F.B.I. Let me help you
Youre damn right I do.
Helen Hudson...
I gotta have Ruben and a...
Spokesupersonu.
Whats this about the Boston Strangler M.J.?
Yes I fed her.  If she says shes hungry shes lying to you.  Again.
And her husband? What was he?
It is?
Are we imagining it?
We sat in B massive traffic jam under an offramp. I dont think we moved more than fifty yards.  Im thinking of taking up a new job with the Road Research Laboratory. They need a medical officer. The salary is larger something Ive got to think about now. Theres a certain moral virtue in being materialistic Im beginning to feel. Well its a new approach for me in any case.
Thats the point. Besides I know I can give something now that I wasnt remotely aware of before. Its not a matter of duty so much as of commitment.
When I first met Vaughan he was a specialist in international computerized traffic systems. I dont know what he is now.
I dont know. You can never be sure with Vaughan. This is his show.
Serious. But youll have to take your new friend the female crashtest dummy. She dropped it off for you.
I live in my car. This is my workshop.
Youre right Ballard. Theres an all night carwash in the airport service area.
I did this already.
What?
I apologize for the inconvenience but I must ask you some...
I think in the spirit of group therapy its beneficial for each of us to open ourselves up to the others.
Well see about adjusting the dosage if that doesnt clear in the next  How are other things going?
Well Letty this does present a liability issue for the hospital.
All I want you to do is think about whats best for you. Really think about it.
Ill talk to her and to Dad too.  A few wiselychosen guilt tactics and theyll be ours.
Truly.
Paul can you hand me the olives? Ruth I need you to what was it?
I can hardly wait til youre free. Planning the wedding without you has been a disaster.
Oh no of course not.
You dont have to make any decisions tonight.
I know.    I know.
Ill be running it three days a week and...
Come on.
Wow.   Congratulations.
Especially with a promotion in the offing.
Can I get you a glass of champagne?
Im sorry. Im so sorry.
But what about Beast?   Wholl...?
I was thinking either the peach moire or cream damask.
Dont be fresh.
Its OK. Its not a passfail kind of thing.
Terrific.
By color.
Its magic.
Enough with the abracadabra.
Good God.
I wont do your portion of kitchen cleanup.
Backtoback sessions with the shrink.
Break up?    They wish.
I just want to see Beast.  Where would you go?
How can you even mention Spaghetti Os after eating Grandma Rosas dinner tonight?
Oh right.     Im ready.   How do I look?
I was brilliant or at least boringly sane.
Ive heard the mission in Santa Barbara is the place to go.
I like it.     But Headlines are better.
Ill be forced to tickle you.
Sounds grim.
You dont have to take care of me you know.
Coming.
Always the drugs.
I saw you talking to my Mom.
I think I should call someone.
I guess so.
Someone has to take care of you right now Michael. You tore up the apartment. You stopped taking your medications.
What do you want to do?
Thats the best idea Ive heard in a long time.
Oh ok.   Maybe.
Sure. Of course.
You can get out of the dinner.
Im going to the store.
Thats a big question.
No.
Hes a patient here.
I love him.
I start on Monday.
I do apologize.    A student had a crisis.
Im glad youre doing well.
Do you know who this is?
You killed her
Look I just want out of this nightmare. I dont know these guys. A few days ago Im in Paris picking pockets and now Im Americas most wanted.
Then we just have to make sure everyone who knows cant say anything.
Not today.   Where are your friends?
Where did they go?
What?   This?
Youre there now?
Youre calling me on your cell phone right?
My numbers going to show up on his bill
What?
 Ive got the tapes. If you ever want to see your brother out of jail do exactly what I say. Bring one million euros to your boat at six oclock.
To tell you that were interested in the property.
And nothing.     Hes just feeling us out.
Supernumerary. It means better than expected.
You should. You can learn a lot about the criminal justice system on a program like that. Very informative. Stay and watch it with me.
He missed three weeks.
You have enough to worry about Angelo. You dont need my problems.
I guess were going to find out.
I dont think it will be a mystery much longer.
You want me to help you get out of the country?
Half the tapes.
I just want to get my people home. I know who you are and what you could do to me if I dont honor my word.
Laurant and Vincent were in business with Zammito.
Youre always pointing out my negative qualities. My analyst says positive reinforcement is a much more productive way of relating with people.
We cant.
Were leaving. Raymond get the bag.
Cops?
And the Vodka.
I cant believe you didnt check.
It was an honest mistake. Ridgeway... Ridgeroad... Ridgeway Road.
Maybe if we gave the tapes back 
Hi. Im one and this is two three four and five.
Good idea.
Thats Frankie Zammito.   The Under boss of the Chicago Mafia.
I would have to say... pretty fuckin bad. You gave us the wrong address Sophie.
Hes been shot a lot.    Hes used to it.
You havent answered my question.
Im leaving you with my friends. Im trusting you to do the right thing today.
I aint no rat.  You got money right?
Fine.     Ten oclock.
Hard to say.
Boy you must be pissed.
Some French guy. At least thats what his passport said. You know Joey I shouldnt be talking to you about this.
No. Its just that the French guy had a gunshot wound on his neck. So this is a homicide. Are you guys involved in this?
A Wallet.    A hotel room card.    Some cash.
Yeah and if you turned it around it would say to go right.
I was told to take what we have and go.
Bastaldi got the address from you yes?
I see.   A master criminal.
What kind of restaurant doesnt serve wine?
Okay.    I will have a beer.
Cmon get real will you. You think hes just going to forget about this? These guys are all about respect. All about honor. Hes coming after us so we might as well take the money.
Yeah but you did do it.   So lets deal with that.
She took everything    Didnt even leave us cab fare.
This is the only American car youve ever driven.
Im not going to leave you.
How about getting on your knees and communicating with my dick?
What are we going to do take a taxi?
Oh Marcel I thought you were somebody else. If I knew it was you I would have never run.
Its my idea.

Whatever He never told me about the Van Gogh or any of the other paintings.
The hell it is.
Fuck me?   Fuck you
Uh huh.
The papers for the car will arrive tomorrow.
I know where she went.
What?
I dont know.
Take a nap.
Something like that.
Its okay.   It was a long time ago.
Its three in the morning.    Not much else to do.
Stick around and find out.
She doesnt know. She thinks I fell down the stairs.
Wait  Im a friend
I do as I please.
Like most things I am nothing. Its the same for this sword.  All of it is simply a state of mind.
Ill never live as a thief
Long.
Dont bother.
Ive made you silk pajamas.  Do you want to change into them?
Youre too young to understand.
Really?
Writers wouldnt sell many books if they told how it really is.
So I heard.  Congratulations.  Its the most important step in a womans life isnt it?
How so?
Dont be a sore loser.  Go ahead. Take your pick.  Ill wait.  Go ahead.
Kneel
Its mine.  It means a lot to me. A barbarian like you wouldnt understand.
Give me back my comb.
You must decide.  You might get tired of this life.  You might begin to miss your family.  If it were our daughter wed look for her too.  She would miss us.  Jen... I want you to be mine forever.  I will make my mark on the world.  I will earn your parents respect. We have a legend.  Anyone who dares to jump from the mountain God will grant his wish.  Long ago a young mans parents were ill so he jumped.  He didnt die.  He wasnt even hurt.  He floated away far away never to return.  He knew his wish had come true.  If you believe it will happen.  The elders say A faithful heart makes wishes come true.
I will.
A faithful heart makes wishes come true.
I left the training early.
During my meditation training... I came to a place of deep silence... I was surrounded by light... Time and space disappeared.  I had come to a place my master had never told me about.
Something I cant let go of.  You are leaving soon?
Perhaps.
You always suspected shed fled to the West.
Be careful.  Sir Te requires discretion.  Official business is difficult enough.  Dont let personal feelings make it worse. And I dont know... even this poster... could be some sort of trap.
Thats not what I meant.  I dont care about the sword.
Jade Fox drugged her.  How did you get here?
My life is departing.  Ive only one breath left.
Thats good.  Sometimes the help cant keep their hands to themselves. Its very embarassing.
A murderer?
We must avenge mother
What does it say?
Sir Te  It has brought him as much trouble as glory.  Help him to leave these troubles behind. Otherwise hell never be able to start anew.
Dont be coy.  Ive always known about your feelings for each other. All these years its a shame... neither of you is brave enough to admit the truth to the other. Youre both wasting precious time.
When it comes to emotions even great heroes can be idiots.  Tell me if Li Mu Bai is not more open the next time you see him.  Ill give him an earful
This is a delicate matter.
What do you have in mind?
Was. ALBRECHT  This isnt Top Dollars style anyway.  This was somebody else. Somebody new.
Annie I need a file.
I knew that.
You gonna wind up working at a school crosswalk.   that doughnuts chocolate you know.
Fucking A my friend.
I saw it too.
I need you to tell me what you remember.  What happened to us?
Funboy had to leave this mortal coil.
I told you youre not supposed to come in here.
Shes dead.  Shes gone.  And now youre just gonna go away and never come back too.  I hate this place it isnt fair.
I think hes yours now.
And shell be alive.  Up here.
Mom tried to cook.
I dont know you.
Last Halloween eh?  Yeah...  Yeah I remember.  I fucked her too I think.
Victims.  Arent we all.
Five large in the drawer right over there.  I never saw you.
TBird?
I want the girl.  Unharmed.  Now.
Yeah I got a more fun idea myself.
Does it hurt?
Shelly?
Yes.
Go away.
Im already alone.
This is a cobra Mr. Grange.  Yes it is real.
Extremely so.  You and I are the recipients of unwanted good fortune in the form of a man everyone is calling The Crow.
I intend no slight to you but I cannot find the English to adequately express just what he is.  I suppose Western mythology would describe him as a Fury.
Is he inside?
No shooting.
Bad news.  Alot of action on the streets tonight and nobody bothered to clear it with me.  Tin Tin got himself whacked.
Annette Harrison.
Really? I thought he said it all the time.
On my mothers life.
No.
I was just being honest. You happen to have a nice ass. Sorry.
Take yourself. Youve slept with several women. Are you happier because of it?
Its not really important.
Whatcha reading?
Several times. Im not as dumb as I act you know. When Howard Roark makes love to Dominique Francon... most romantic scene in all of literature.
Thats a matter of opinion.
Why dont you come join me for a swim and well discuss it.
Please.
You know you could at least have the decency of telling me whos badmouthing me so I might have the opportunity to confront them face to face. How do you know its not some girl whos pissed off at me for breaking up with her?
Is that the last thing you need? My your clever.
Refreshing.
Its my house.
No thank you.
Im trying to better myself but the one person who can help me is the same one pushing me away.
Well try this one on for size. I think Im falling in love with you.
Its not about being happy. You and I cant 
How was your date?
What are you doing?
Of Human Bondage.
I cant win with you.
I am lighten. Can we drop this?
No.
Where are you going?
I think thats for the best.
Oh please Annette. You spend all your time preaching about waiting for love. Well here it is. Right in front of you but youre going to turn your back on it. Im sorry that were not at the age where we can get married. If we were Id propose but thats not going to happen. So I guess were just fucked. Ill move on but you... youre going to have to live with yourself knowing youve turned your back on love. And that makes you a hypocrite.
Hi.
Yeah me neither.
Im just being honest. I just wanted to see what you were like in bed.
What your virginity? Well thats over now.
Im sorry about that.
Not anymore. Football team started practice last week. Hes already called me to hook up.
Dont you raise your voice at me. Go to your room now.
What a loser she must be.  Anyhow Courts invited me to the Hamptons for Labor Day Weekend.
Do you want to learn or not?
It was nothing.
Okay.
Oh come on Cecile. Hes crazy about you.
Why?
Its Kathryn.
I... I dont think you want to know.
Thats one way of looking at it.
Of course. Im not a monster.
I swear.
Same time next week?
Jesus Christ how can you be so stupid?
Get out of here.
Did you do everything I asked you to?
I told you I dont know.
Racist piece of shit.
Dont worry about it. Ill stay.
In any event my feelings were hurt when I learned that he had fallen for someone else. Someone chaste... pure... innocent.
Sounds intriguing.
Shut up and turn to page 64.
It just so happens were not in Kansas anymore. Our little angels father has accepted the new headmaster position at Oakwood. Shes staying with my aunt up in Connecticut while Daddy sells his house. Can you imagine what this would do for my reputation? Screwing the new headmasters virginal daughter before school starts? It will be my greatest victory.
Shhh.
You ready for this? Ive recently discovered that our good friend Mrs. Caldwell is the one who sent the letter to Annette urging her to stay away from me.
Thank you. Mmmm that feels good.
I hate it too.
Well let me know when you do. Until then.
Eat me Sebastian. Its alright for you to fuck everyone but because Im a girl its wrong. Well let me tell you something I didnt ask to be a girl. Do you think I relish the fact that I have to act like Mary Sunshine twenty four seven so I can be considered a laaaady. Do you think I take great delight when I hear  Kathryn is so wonderful. Kathryn is a model child. Kathryn is going to make an excellent wife one day.  Im the Marsha fucking Brady of the upper East Side and sometimes I want to kill myself for it. No I dont enjoy being a part of the weaker sex and for that reason everyone around me is going to suffer. So theres your psychoanalysis Doctor Freud. Now are you in or are you out?
Whats your problem?
Morning.
Whered she go?
Kind of.
Oh yes.
Ive never done this before.
I have a flair for drama.
I accept. Now get out.
Thats beautiful.
Like your stepbrother Sebastian. I cant believe they didnt expel him after what he did to the school nurse.
Well... you promise you wont say anything to her. Weve developed a friendship and...
Annette Annette
I did?
Nope.
I cant have you do that nor can I have you hanging around the lobby all day.
Youre a lucky guy.
It seems that you and I have some talking to do.
You bastard
Hello. I just met Amy and she pointed out where you live.
What do you mean?
I can make wishes like this come true.  Ill be just like Daddy wants me to be  play with the other children  not sit around by myself  tell the truth 
The song I was trying to hum. The song my friend taught me.
Sometimes.
Thats what I wished on. Edward says its a wishing ring  and it is
At the old house with the voice.
I had my breakfast while you were still asleep.
Whats her name?
Irena.
Times have changed.
No kids yet.  Somethings gone wrong. Maybe I ought to call somebody.
But they must have.  Amy and I made them out together.  You mailed them didnt you Edward?
Im never unfair.
Im not shouting at you but theres no doubt in my mind that you spoil this child
Well you know where it is.
Amy picked it off the top of that stack. Perhaps youd better go through the whole bunch. There may be others of Irena in there.
I suppose so.
Yes daddy.
Yes I did.
Ill show you.
I didnt forget.
Daddy its true.
But...
No.
Well I guess were not a very proper family.
Ive wanted a friend too. Ive been lonely.
For always then. Only you must promise never to tell anyone about me
No. This must be a friendship that only we shall have... you and I... Amy and her friend.
Ill just never learn arithmetic.
Yes yes I see Prince
This is more fun than just pretend.
But we dont have any sea weed.
It is wildness and freedom. No one can touch it.
Yes Amy.
Deaths like life. Deaths a part of life. It isnt frightening. It isnt the end of everything. It isnt quiet and nothingness. Its a part of all eternity.
Maybe if its a real mourning ring like we have in Jamaica. All you got to do is turn it on your finger close your eyes and make a wish.
Im trying to.
Will you come soon?
I do suppose so. But if you were there yesterday guess you can get there today.
But I saw what it was. Its the little deer.
If you were the lady who gave me a ring my mother says I have to give it back to you.
The ring? Well have no more nonsense about the ring.
Then Ill tell you a story  a lovely story. Do you know the story of Rapunzel?
Do you know the story of The Headless Horseman?
Yes yes 
My Barbara was killed. I killed her. Yes it was my fault. Everyone told me not to drive from the theatre. There was a raging wind that night and snow and ice. All was well until we got to the Sleepy Hollow bridge. Barbara was singing a little song and then ...I dont know how it happened ..when I awakened they told me the car was overturned and they wouldnt let me see Barbara. Barbara was dead.
Anybody could know that song.
Ishant see her. No Barbara no.
Thats from her  that woman.
Such a brief visit but dear child it has made my Christmas very merry.
I imagine a child would have to commit murder or rob the Seventh National Bank of Tarrytown to be deprived of a birthday party.
She needed a companion so out of her own hunger she created one. In her mind her friend was in the garden. In her mind her friend never leaves her. Right this very minute Im sure shes upstairs sobbing out her grief to a friend who exists only in her mind.
Whats with her? If theyre not bleeding theyre PMSing. If theyre not PMSing theyre warning you about the impending doom. If youre lucky you get a sane person one week a month. Then you gotta date three or four women just to get some normalcy in your life.
James Dean Humphrey Bogart...
Yeah but they looked cool...
Your lips look delicious.
Never felt better.
I get crazy dreams and I black out.
No its mom.
Anythings better than Mark.
So dont look in his eyes.
Youre just saying that.
No it grosses me out even thinking of putting something in my eye.
Maybe he likes you ever think of that? Its good for you to go out  get your mind off Mark.
To sound like big macho cops. He was probably just found with a knife in his back.
Youre at his place and you come out of the bathroom looking all shy and say Im so embarrassed but could you run out and get me some tampons? If he says no hes too embarrassed then you know hes a wus. If he says hes got some in the bathroom then you know there are other women around a lot. But if he says yes and goes to get you tampons well then hes a decent guy. Then while hes out...
I cant help it. My bra wouldnt even fit. Ive been going to Victorias Secret and exchanging bras for bigger ones and still Im busting out. Its this PMS.
Because of PMS I get hairy my nails turn into claws I eat raw meat I roam the city hunting for flesh. Ive become a werewolf
I should call the police. Oh no Peter. Peter is the police
Youre right. Its just I cant cover up a murder so George wont know youre cheating.
I think I turned into a werewolf and killed him.
Tell them youll meet them outside.
Hide him.
Who is this Madame Sconce? Lets find her and talk to her.
You scared the shit out of me. I thought you were killing yourself.
I guess youll find out.
Did I kill a guy named Benito?
Oh thank god. Maybe this whole thing is really over.
Sure. See ya.
Hey how about a little nightcap?
Yes I do have to pee
You havent even paid me back the thousand bucks you owe me
Take your shower.
Did you change your hair?
No?
Thats my ex. Hes an asshole. In case you couldnt tell. I think hes been following me.
No. Really. I dont drink coffee anymore. I used to love it but my tastes have changed recently.
So what book did you buy?
Me neither. Thats why I wear briefs... So why did you and... Mark break up?
NO I... I checked when I put my stuff in. I always look through the washer first.
Frida can we come in? We need to talk to you. Its important.
It wasnt a date. Jennifer invited me along to dinner with them.
No but thanks for the warning.
This is a lot worse than Betty.
No my bites a lot worse.
Like I had to say it? No I wanted to say it.
No. But I dont mind hairy. Are you okay?
Yes or no? Frida cant you just be honest with me?
You want the truth? Remember I tried to tell you something the other day?
Worse than this?
What about... those guys... I might have...
Okay.
Thanks.
You got a dog?
How big?
Packages of money.
Tell her Im eating.
Its so bad she becomes a werewolf.
Were just trying to figure out what happened.
Why would you want to be a cop?
Man youre livin dangerously. Let me ask you somethin you always have to get women drunk before theyll sleep with you?
I told you she was innocent.
She was never a suspect Lloyd. Some animal must have done this.
Back in the 80s. You didnt see the pictures? They were from before she got famous. She was hairy as hell. Her pits her bush.
And he was missing an arm.
Okay Lloyd you tell me how she killed them.
She wasnt the last one to see them alive. Whoever killed them was.
Hard to tell. Looks like hes been cleaned up and hes decomposing as we speak. This case gets weirder by the minute.
Okay Lloyd. First no way does Frida have the physical strength to tear a guy to shreds. Second why would she be so obvious and let it be known she was the last one to see these guys? Third shes the one in danger. Shes a woman in jeopardy and youre layin a murder rap on her. Fourth I look in her eyes and know shes no killer.
I know. I followed you. To the zoo to her house to your house...
What makes her think that?
Cant figure out the species. Similar to a wolf. Theyre jokin at the lab that a werewolf probably killed him. Aint that the stupidest thing you ever heard?
How will we interrogate them?
He tried to kill me
I dont know what youre talking about.
I think its time you introduced us to your little friends.
You wouldnt believe me if I told you Inspector.  Have patience   youll see for yourself.
How could you have been so stupid?
Sorry sir.
Patricia Crenshaw.
Good.
Yes sir.  uEverythingu?
Shutup.
I    ah  couldnt think of anything else to do.  I thought maybe you know something...  Im scared.
Why are they after you?
Dont know much do you?
It sure isnt the funfair.
This ocean business...  I know where I can find a map.  I need to go back to the station.  Where will you be?
Yes.
It must be a closet or something.
Everyone has a job    a function.  Each one teaches you more about your invention.  Im what is called a umurdereru.
But I...
Waves...  A beach.  A woman whispering.  Thats all.  I need to stay awake.  Do you have any pills?
Youre supposed to be my doctor right?
You remember nothing eh?  Let me show you something.
No it isnt.  uYouu are doing it  Now raise it over the glass and...
Nothing.  I dont know anything
Im...  being...  punished.
Cause you know I can do other stuff. I mean  if you wanted me to talk or...
What?
What the hell is this ?
Great.
The guys in a coma Bob.
Like how?
Mild stroke?
Its simple Alan.  We send the Vice President to Africa or something dig up some dirt on him force him to resign and get our President to nominate a new one.  The whole thing takes a few weeks tops.
I just hope this yutz can pull it off.
Weve got nothing Bob.  This wont work.
I dont want him caring about his wife What about the Vice President
Hes only doing what you told him to.
Just what you think I mean.
Its fine.
Im not sure.
Choices?
You could buy it on payments.
Im not sure... I might have.
Well... I gues I would... Yeah.
I see what you mean.
A teleprompter.
Right.  Now whenever he stands at a Podium the President always puts one hand in the pocket of his coat...
But we went there.  We saw those kids.
Does it make the cars any better?
Why?
Well Im sure thats really important but I dont want to tell some eight yearold kid he has to sleep in the street because we want people to feel better about their cars.  Do you want to tell him that?
Certainly.
All Ive got is my integrity.  Thats all I have.  Now I dont know why you turned your attack dogs on me.
Mr. Kovic.   Were not here about your taxes.
No.
Wed like to hire you.
What about it?
I had a feeling.
The VicePresident...
Well...
Uh...
Go tuck yourself Bill.
Anybody would have done it.
I dont know.
Home.
Oh... Okay.
He wasnt always like that anyway.
You have a lot of secrets.
I know.
Yeah... Bedtime.
Yeah well... Its finally over.
I know.
All set.
NO...NOOOOOOO...SHOOT ME SHOOT ME SHOOOOOOOOOT MEEEEEEEEE
Two of us...only two of us...me...and him. 
I dunno. Landing pad for a helicopter? I dunno.
Quiet
Im sorry. I was...busy. In the lab.
SHUT UP MISS HENRIED I TOL YA BFORE
Im sorry General if I...spoke out of turn. Its just that...Mr Tyler is not here to defend himself. He has no representation. I dont believe due process is being served by...
Gasparilla?
Thats why we didnt use prayers on this here white coat til after he was destroyed. We ready to fight when we have to. And we gotta fight now.
Hes just finding another reason for bumpin us off. Dont ya see. He needs us ta die. He needs our bodies.
The hospital? 
We got a boat.
Were gonna blow up the powder magazine.
Quicker than gas. And it smells a lot prettier. It usually dont kill but it puts ya under fer a good nights sleep.
I tol him. I tol him this is a dead place. Like all the others.
You have ruined weeks of work here Weve been trying to wean these specimens onto alligator meat
Ah yes our noble Gasparilla does seem to favour you lately. I understand he assigned you a roommate of your choice. The rest of us have to pick names out of a hat.
In the battle sir.
Im alright. Lets go.
Say Steve wheres your manners?  Heres Mutts brother and you dont offer him a drink? Want some bourbon?
Knox?
Come on.  Itll help you get Chris.
Well?

Officer Hector Sanchez Sergeant. Hillside Academy.  Status G8. Security Clearance 3.  One year Advance Technical Crime Analyst. Weapons Assistant.  FDA Junior Captain Hollywood division
But Sergeant...
Trust me.  You dont want to know.
Bout the same time I busted Doucet I tried to nail this bigtime dealer. I didnt have an ID but I was close. Too close.  Gained the confidence of a badass named Dubbs.  He was going to turn me onto the big man.  He made me for a cop.  Mysteriously my fellow officers discovered ten pounds of heroin in my cruiser.
Nothing makes sense when youre a cop.
Hey Rip Van Winkle maybe wed better call it a night.
Never use it.  Stuffll kill ya.
Yes sir.
With all this technology you dont even have to show up for work.  Who needs cops when youve got gizmos.
Were partners arent we?
Thats just it.  He never did time. Seems each arrest was botched for one reason or another.  Judge threw out the cases each time.  Either hes got a horseshoe up his ass or powerful friends.
Aaah... Mother of Jesus.
Hes got my grandson Sanchez.
And you should be with your family.
This is the guy that killed my partner.
They always are.
Yeah.
My mom says Im gonna grow.

We are alone...
Yes?... How was your journey?
Its a highefficiency filter and heat exchange system. Perspiration passes through the first layer and is gathered in the second. The salt is separated. Breathing and walking provide the pumping action. The reclaimed water circulates to catchpockets from which you can drink through this tube at your neck. Urine and feces are processed in the thigh pads. Should you be in the open desert remember to breathe in through your mouth out through the nose tubes.
Is this what you seek?
They said you were dead.  They said...
I will take the boyman... he shall have sanctuary in my tribe...  A LOW NOTE on a dip stick is blown by one of the Fremen tribe.  Jessica shifts Paul sees it and just as Stilgar begins a reach for his weapon Jessica turns slashes out utters a SOUND whirls again and with rock behind her holds Stilgar helpless in front of her  her hand at his throat. Paul moves on her first move.  He races up a rocky incline.
It could only be one thing....  Its a crysknife.

You gonna tell me what happened with you and Exley?
This business Captain?
Call me Dudley.
Of course... But how?
Yeah sure... I got a couple of hours before I have to be at the Victory.  Want to grab a beer?
What was that boyfriends name?
Its a surprise.  You like surprises dont you White?
Get the fuck away from me.
They didnt find the shotguns. They planted them.
There are no rules  Why the fuck are you doing this?  The Nite Owl made you.  You want to tear all that down.
Which one are you and which one am I?
At least not anymore.
We should check the records and we should talk to Lynn.
Im not asking you.
You know I do or you wouldnt be here.  How did you find me?
He no longer works for me.  Find Susans killer Mr. White. Ill give you a handsome reward. uWhatever you desireu.
I got her address.
And you fuck people up for a living.  That dont make me you. uCapisceu shitbird?
His file listed you as a known associate.  Now spill.
Deuce Perkins.  Mickey Cs narcotics lieutenant.  The night he got clipped eighteen pounds of Mickeys heroin went missing.
Hes under a tract house in San Berdoo.  And he dont smell too good.  What happened to the heroin Johnny?
uEar plugsu.
It doesnt exactly play like dumb panic.
The public demands justice sir. This was a fullfledged riot of policemen.  Shift the guilt to men whose pensions are secured.  Force them to retire.  But someone has to swing.  Indict try and convict Stensland and Bud White.  Secure them jail time.  Feed them to the sharks sir.  Protect yourself protect the department.
Say what and so what.
I dont own no shotguns.
I got nothin more to say till I see a judge.
Gone.  Not a trace.
Im happy to cooperate.  You dont need to tie me down.
Ill break them sir.
Dont start trying to do the right thing John.  You havent had enough practice.
uThrowing meu?
What about you?
I want you to follow Bud White.
What?
Yeah.  But first I want to brace Stompanato.
What?
A guy dressed as Santa has been exposing himself to kids in Los Feliz.  Apparently sir hes decorated himself.
With tinsel and plastic icicles and... on his penis sir.
Of his penis sir?
I know who you are.  Youre the policeman Bud told me about.
You want to know what Buds like in bed?
I see Bud because I want to.  I see Bud because he cant hide the warmth he has inside him.
I see Bud because he makes me feel like Lynn Bracken and not some Veronica Lake lookalike who fucks for money.  I see him because he doesnt know how to disguise who he is.  Theres more if you want to hear it.
I dont hate White.  I really dont.  Its just in my business its the wild cars you have to watch out for.
Some reality.
Youre the first person to ever call me tough.
Without what his smearing yours first?  Whats he got on you Loew?  Pictures of you and an out of work actor with your pants down?
Officer White?
I dont doubt it  Oh God.
You lost me Sid.  Who?
I need an extra fifty.  Two patrolmen at twenty apiece and a dime for the watch commander at Hollywood Station.
You didnt get my message?  It got called off.  The kid chickened out at the last minute.
Jesus.  Jack thats a story. Swish Actor Gets The Gay Blade. Let me get my camera.
Dope liquor hookers that look like movie stars.  Pierce Patchett has it all.
You know when I came out to L.A. this isnt exactly where I saw myself ending up.
Vincennes is there someplace youd rather be?
Oh?  Anyplace else?

I didnt want you to be upset. I shouldnt have lied. Stacy theres nothing between me and Rachel Banks.
Stacy
Was that doctoredup too?
I went to the bank to see why. They said you emptied our accounts

I take a straight 15 percent. Brills fee varies with risk. Perhaps youd be more comfortable using someone else.
He doesnt work that way.
The IRS contacted me this morning. They say my lifestyle and receipts exceed my income.

He said  be careful.
Pardon?

A lie.  What do you hate most?
This is empty just coming
Im not agreeing.  Dont think Im agreeing because Im not.
Dont go over it again please.
Would you let me pass?
I cant move.  I cant get out.
I know.  Im sorry.  Ill make a fire. Ill be back.
Listen to me Katharine.  Youve broken your ankle and Im going to have to try and bind it.  I think your wrist might be broken too  and some ribs which is why its hurting you to breathe.  Im going to have to walk to El Taj.  Given all the traffic in the desert these days I should bump into one army or another before I reach there  or FenelonBarnes and his camel.  And then Ill be back and well be fine and Ill never leave you.
I know.
I havent no.  Sorry.
Could I trouble you for some water?
Cut the ropes.  I left a note on his blanket.  At the next Geographical Society I shall await with great interest the announcement of the FenelonBarnes Slave Knot.  The Girl wouldnt leave of course.  Her father had sold her for a camel. He turns over the propeller the engine cranks up.
Good were all here?  A toast to the International Sand club  may it soon resurface.
Absolutely right shut up. Lashings of apologies all round.

Shutup

No sand.  Thats your drugs speaking.
Yes?
Please dont waste your time on pleasantries 
He came back he says he caught a rabbit.  Im cooking it.
K is for Katharine.
Hey 
Never heard of it.
Yes for your hair.
I didnt like that book either. Its all about men.  Too many men. Just like this house.
I promise you that was the right thing to do.  Hes my good luck.  Now cut.  This one.  I hope we dont die.
I should go to the house get breakfast.
Im thinking about your heart not your skin.  And how to reach it. And that I dont think I can.  A bomb has ruined us just not the bomb I thought would ruin us.
Hello miss.
Hes sleeping.
Does he have to go?
Go away.
This is making me incredibly angry.
 The Wonder House comma as the natives called the Lahore Museum.
Hana we have discovered a shared please  the boy and I.
Go on do it.  I dont need to hear any more.
Why?  Are you German?
Through a window.
Meaning no one arranges calalilies like that. He left the window open when he came in. His only mistake.
You want to blow the whole thing go right ahead.
Who am I?
Its sold.
How about if you try disappearing.
Youre like malaria. Once you get it you cant get rid of it.
Something of great value something of such artistic and historic significance that only you could truly appreciate...
Uh yes.
Ill call an ambulance.
I sincerely hope so.
So what?
You...you cant.
No. Why would I be?
The most important piece of Chinese art outside of China.
So youve heard all those stories about me. Well I can assure you theyre not true. And if they were true Ive retired.
Good morning.
As I recall youve robbed it before.
In a week.
We go underwater?
Try laps. Say a hundred.
A dozen times.
Itsbeautiful.
Terrified. Still am.
Bookshelf. Sensors
In eye of that painting.
Its a party.
No no please God youre wrong. Im a thief. Just like you.
Its your mistake.
Get the hell in.
Speaking of money. You said billions. How many?
Okay 8020
My eighty your twenty smart guy
Hold the record. Alone.
Theres food in the fridge. I wont be long.
You took the Rembrandt I figured it was a fair trade.
My job my rules.
Youre being useless. Im making us rich.
Transfer.
Were doing it tonight.
Theres no way to practice this. And no time. Besides Ive planned it all. There arent any surprises.
What? Another job? Stealing the Eiffel Tower?
Brought us luck once maybe it will again.
Im not leaving without you.
But
Next time Ill use valet parking.
Which is
Yeah the lord of the manor doesnt haul his own groceries.
This is big enough.
Its a death mask. Death mask means dead.
Youre impressed with her arent you?
She reminds you of yourself. Theres nobody you admire more.
Its never happened before. What makes you think its happening now?
Youre giving them to me?
We wear so many goddam masks after a while they get stuck to our faces you know? And they dont come off. But when you find the one person who really knows you and then you lose her...
Thanks.  Ill keep it in mind.
Hey excellent.  Thanks.
Nothing you cant show up for with a stain.
Its an inflammation of the spinal cord and part of the brain.
Yeah Im real sorry to hear that.
Ill say.  Holy moley.
Right but  Im sorry I dont see why you were corresponding with PGE about it in the first place.
They did?
The what?
Not around here.  This is a rough part of the world.  Hard times not a lot of money not a lot of luck.  Its a challenge staying healthy in a town like this.  Heck even our dogs up and die.
It was right up on the PGE property over there.
Right but  didnt you say he was paid by PGE?
For what?
Well then  if youre feeling up to it maybe we should talk shop.
A number for the whole group or for us?
Any school you want.
Yup.
Oh.  Okay.  Thats okay.
Wheres Anna?
Excuse me?
I left a message.  Ive been dealing with that real estate thing.  I was gonna write up a whole damn report and 
I got an interesting call this afternoon. It was from a Dr. Frankel.
Course I did.
Look Erin this is not the way I do business this extortion nonsense.
So far.  But that place is a pig sty.  I wouldnt be surprised if theres more.
Thats crazy  why not?
Oh you do?  With all your legal expertise you believe that?
Yeah yeah.  Remind me of that when Im filing for bankruptcy.
They skipped that step.
PGE corporate is claiming they had no way of knowing what was going on in Hinkley.
From their tone of voice on the phone Id say theyre taking us more seriously.
Its my paycheck.  Which I earned.  Which I deserve.  Which I shouldnt have to beg for. That fatass bitch wont give it to me.
With nothing linking it to the corporate offices yet Id say well end up on the lower end of that.  Still a lot of money.
Oh now dont get all jealous Ed.  I got a little something for you too.
How do you know that?
Corey.
Right.
And ...?
Thats right.
What do you mean?
I guess I did.
I wish I knew.  Its for my boss.  Hes fighting his water bill and he wants me to find all manner of bills from all kinds of places.  The easiest thing would probably be if I just squeezed back there with you and poked around myself.  Would that be okay?
Nope.  Maiden.
Not anymore.
Harmful like  how?  What would you get?
Good luck.  Oh  I wouldnt advertise what youre looking for if I were you ...
I dont know.
Some meeting.  With PGE people.
You never fall short for the work people.  I guess maybe you just love them more.
Yeah.  She is.  But you know what?  Thats why Im helping her.  So she can get some medicine to make her feel better.
You dont know six hundreds plaintiffs numbers by heart.
Annabelle Daniels.  7144549346.
What the hell do you think youre doing making all that Goddamn noise?
You got more than one?
Why not?
I do construction which pays real good. And I make it last by living cheap.
Then lemme remind you the polite thing is to say thank you thats a real nice offer I dont mind taking you up on it.
Cause I like kids.  I like hanging out with them.
Yup.  Usually working on my bike.  No big deal.  If it doesnt work out you can send em back to the chicken fat lady.
What do you mean?
No Im not.  Look at me.  Im not.
No see  thats exactly what those arrogant PGE fucks want me to think  that because they got all this money and power we dont stand a chance in hell against them.  But you know what?  Theyre wrong.
How would you know?
Keep your voice down.
Just a few more minutes then we can go.  Take her will you?
I cant.  Look  this job  its the best thing that ever happened to me.  I mean it. For the first time in my life I got people respecting me.  Up in Hinkley I walk into a room and everyone shuts up just to hear what I got to say.  I never had that.  Ever. Dont ask me to give it up.  I need it.
I need it.
Mmhm.
Yeah well  good help is hard to find.
Yeah but Im gonna get better.  A lot of these folks arent.
Outside with the sprinkler.  So its good?
My daughter shes bought a big house with a room for me.  Im going to move in with her.
Yes?
Is this a joke?  Did Baxter put you up to this?
No one put me up to anything.  I was just hoping I could ask you a couple questions.
Right I guess those are the kids 
You did?
Asteroids dont concern me Admiral. I want that ship not excuses.  How long until you can have Skywalker and the others in the Millennium Falcon before me?
Yes Admiral .... soon.
Alert all commands.  Calculate every possible destination along their last known trajectory and disburse the fleet to search for them.  Dont fail me again Admiral Ive had quite enough
But Han and Leia will surely die.
Barks an argument and shakes his head.
Im sure Ill see you again too. Keep well.  Youd better chain him until its over.
Barks his right on
Away put your weapon.  I mean you no harm.
Looking?  Looking?  Youve found someone Id say.  Heh?  Yes
A great warrior?  Not many on those.  Wars dont make one great.
Okay Artoo let him have it. Now get out of here little fellow weve got things to do.
Probably isnt good enough Sergeant. Check on it
There is a grave disturbance in The Force.
You are weak  I have seen it. The Force is strong with him. He must be destroyed.
Sir Im almost afraid to ask but does shutting down all but emergency power systems include me?
Im going to see what it is.
No kidding.  If this snowballs got nasty natives they could be anywhere.
This babys got a few surprises left in her.
Two more Star Destroyers heading right at us.
How do I look?
Well I hope you dont expect more.
Theyre just trying to see if they can stir something up ... were safe.
Afraid of?  Certainly not you Captain Solo ... or any other man in this galaxy.
Where?
There will be more of them.  They always travel in groups.  And theres nothing they like better than to attach themselves to ships. Just what we need right now.
Chewie check the manual release on the landing claws.
The fleet is finally breaking up. Im hoping theyll follow standard Imperial procedure and dump their garbage before they go into light speed.
Can you trust him?
Somethings wrong here.  Your friend Lando is very charming but I dont trust him.
Chewie do you think you can repair him?
Im worried about all of us.  I cant figure out what theyre up to.
Hyperdrive.
Not as well as Id like.  Were a small outpost and not very self sufficient.  Ive had supply problems of every kind and ...  Whats so funny?
You will find them well enough. But they must never again leave this city.
I didnt know you had a price on your head.  Vader has given you to the bounty hunter.
... were the bait.
Im coming over to your side thats what.  And I have a feeling Im making a big mistake.
I didnt say anything?
Its Luke.  Get under him.  Slow down.  Easy Chewie.  Line up your tracking system.  Lando open the hatch.
Are the coordinates set?
Closer?
Im fine.  Really.  Leia ... when I was out there and it looked pretty bad ... well it made me think about things.
Size has no meaning.  It matters not.  Look at me.  Judge me by my size do you?
I thought those seekers were set for stun
Bespin.  I see it too ... Friends you have there heh?  Concentrate and see them you will.
It is the future you see.
Foreknowledge is helpful but painful sometimes and dangerous too.  You have far to go in your training.
Ill die first.
Anything on the Millennium Falcon?
Yes sir.  Were in luck.  The sick bays almost empty except for a mauled fox cub a deer with pneumonia and a depressed gorilla. The Apes will be hidden from the public.  Theyll be quarantined. If they want medical attention its available on the spot.  And the experts can start giving them the onceover first thing in the morning. General Brodys very pleased.
Its a strain of the Plutoxin 7 virus. Genetically engineered. 100 pure death. Complete nervous system shutdown. You crash and bleed out like a stuck pig. Not a pretty sight.
You never heard of Snake Plissken?
Go on now. Do as I say.
Nobody leaves Cuervo Jones. Not unless you give your life. You fight till youre dead. Then I forgive you.  Understand?  Understand?
Well see.
You said I could be VicePresident Cuervo. Your righthand man.
Can you land?
My name is no longer Carjack. Will you please get that through your fucking head?
Whats the little black box do?
Having second thoughts?
Theres a war about to be declared or didnt you know?
A medical team will be standing by.
No.
Nuclear turbine to 75 power.
Its history. I gotta go.
Youre gonna have to learn to respect the law Snake. The United States is a no smoking nation. No smoking no drinking do drugs no women unless youre married no guns no foul language. Its a brand new day for you Snake.
I give you my word. Put the prototype into my hands and youre a free man.
Delgado?
Oh man... You didnt have to hit me Snake. I can help you.
I couldve helped you. We coulda made a deal with Cuervo. If youd listen...
I couldnt help it Snake. I had to shoot you. Cuervo made me do it I swear to God man.
Which way?
Yeah. So how do I get to Venice?
Which way to the Hollywood Bowl?
Wheres... Cuervo Jones...?
Where?
Who?
The Surgeon General of Beverly Hills.
I just thought you wanted to get away. I didnt know you wanted to go someplace.
The what?
Find Cuervo Jones.
Thank God.
I will not.
Then make me your champion and I will always fight in your place.
We spared the lives of a few so they could sail home and tell their fellows what fate they met at the hands of King Arthurs knights...
It is deep...
Thats not why you came.
The Lady of the Lake. Take it. Take it quickly
Just yes? No mad laughter no riddles nothing but a simple yes? That frightens me.
I didnt ask for poetry. Which is it?
My powers fade Arthur. I resort to cheap tricks...  Yes I enjoy every moment of my foolishness I join in the making of it so no one can betray me. But you You betray yourself.
You betray the boy who drew the sword the boy who saw the Dragon... the Dragon who moves close by coiling and uncoiling restless looking down waiting for the King to be a king...
It is like a tree. The roots of the stones spread out across the land and they draw on the thoughts and actions of men. Like sap those human matters course through the stones feeding the stars that are the leaves of the tree. And the stars whisper back to men the future course of events.  But the earth is being torn apart its metals stolen and the balance is broken and the lines of power no longer converge. In fact I nearly didnt make it in one piece.
Not you my husband?
If I am your judge I cannot be your champion. When I act as your King I cannot be your husband.
Forgive me my wife if you can. I was not born to live a mans life but to be the stuff of future memory. The fellowship was a brief beginning a fair time that cannot be forgotten and because it will not be forgotten that fair time may come again. Now once more I must ride with my knights to defend what was and the dream of what could be.
I am a fighting man and I am married to the quest. That is enough.
He has given up.
Is that Mandrake Lord Merlin?
Can it truly be used for magic?
No. Yes I am. I am jealous. I want to write poems about you with moonbeams make the sea sing your name...
People make you laugh?
Flattery Do you think I am ignorant of your stupid little games? Preying on you weakness of others. Thats your power a petty evil. Mine is great. Great plans. Impossible dreams. Laughable endings...
Whats behind that beauty? A wizened coldhearted snake.
I am the desert where water disappears
One land one king That is my peace
Dumb riddles Merlin. I am your King.
I?
To kill and be king is that all?
Well whats wrong?
Whats he doing there? Teaching?
Dont you think hes too old though? Hows his health?
I didnt know that.
Yes.
Thank you your excellency.
Whats this?
No. Not at all
Not that I know of.
Want to ask him?
Look he wouldnt have any reason to be up there in the first place.
When shes well enough Ill ask.
I just heard them Karl.
Oh Karl Jesus Christ Karl dont do that.
No thanks Karl.
Good morning Mrs. MacNeil.
Stimulant? Shes higher than a kite right now
Do you think I should take her to see a psychiatrist?
Ya know those things to get attention like saying that her bed shakes and stuff.
She used those words. Look I doubt that she even understood what she was saying.
Dont be alarmed. If its a lesion in a way shes fortunate. All we have to do is remove the scar.
What was going on in there how could she jump off the bed like that?
Sure did.
He didnt mention her.
The priest.
Since we learned about mental illness paranoia schizophrenia. All the things they taught me in Harvard. Mrs. MacNeil since the day I joined the Jesuits Ive never met one priest who has performed an exorcism not one.
Could you see her?
Nothing you could do would make it any worse.
What else?

A gift.  Courtesy of our courteous hotel manager Mr. Daniels.  We dear brother are a fucking smash.  Yup.  They want us back.  Easter.  It seems they have this egg hunt every year.  Only not for kids. Adults.  They stuff these plastic eggs with Timexes and little certificates for free Mai Tais and everyone has a grand time crawling around on the front lawn.  Then afterwards they have a dance.  An egg dance.  Everyone comes dressed in a different colored shell and at the end of the evening they crack themselves open.  Its our job to separate the yolks from the whites. Slippery business.
Yeah.
The tenths out.
I mean maybe you should check with us before you go off and book us a month in advance.
No.
A channel. Its just a little further down the dial thats all. Look its publicity.  Publicitys publicity.  Right?

Everything I say is wrong. I cant talk to her anymore.

 I called but Im not Castor.  Im your husband.
What more proof do you need?
Jon if Im not there he will be tipped off.  Ill get rid of Jamie  but you and I are in this together.
No life signs at all. Hes a turnip.
Would it?
The left I think.  Those surgeons in Witness Protection can fix things nobodys even broken yet.
I just asked you about making love to your wife and you started talking about your job.
You said it Jon not me.
Vacuumsealed globe ... shouldnt take long.
Trust me hes already here. Get going
I wont tell mom if you dont.

Are you TRYING to give us away? For somebody with such a big brain you think awfully small.
Most of the current chiefs  they must have pretty hefty prices on their heads.
Good because I checked your salary  and it bites.  How the everyday workingclass stiff survives in todays economy is something Ill never ...
A lot of people think youre a snitch.  Its dangerous ...
D.C.s very high on giving you the promotion.  Theres just one problem.
It didnt work out as planned. Where are you off to?
Dont I usually kiss my wife?
Wouldnt be the first time  or would it?

But its twenty degrees outside...
And...?
I thought we had a deal about you watching CNBC in bed.
Its ten thirty Jack. By eleven youre gonna be sprawled out on the bed snoring your head off. We dont have time for wining and dining.
No Im serious...youre really stunning...
I mean back in college you were a very pretty girl theres no question about that.  But this...  ...youve really grown into a beautiful woman...
Do what?
Really.
I cant believe its not a disappointment to you  Jesus Kate I couldve been a thousand times the man I became.  How could you do this to me?  How could you let me give up on my dreams like this?
You had a heart attack?
Its wonderful...
What are you sure about?
I dont think Id fight you on that one...
Think bigger.
Im talking about the best schools in the country here Kate...
No Jack I never got married. You?
Hello Jack.  You dont have to stop singing on my account...
A shelter?  Im the richest guy in the building...Ive got twice the square footage you have
Thatll happen when youre about to spend thirty billion dollars on some aspirin...
But youre not interested in boutique dollars...  I get it...
Thats easy. Youve seen my car.
So well get egg nog.
Merry Christmas...
Yes
I wouldnt know anything about that.
Ben think about all the people we can help if this works 
Im sure hes matured since then.
Ben.  This is serious.  uTurn aroundu.
Three days.  I was worried about you. How are you feeling?
I think I need to lie down.  Bad shrimp.
Deb its me.  Its still me.
I already got it.  Everything I want.
To help you.  Ive run every test known to man.  And they all yield the same result uthe machine is readyu.
And you can?  Power it up?
Ben  Ben
Youve been working out.
Act.  Here we go again.  Reed what if we got these gifts for a ureasonu?  What if we have some you know...like calling?
I dont know if weve noticed but the sickest runs this side of the Alps are iright outside that windowi 
Last one down springs for room service.
uPleaseu tell me you go silent too.
Okay mom.
Grow up Johnny.  You want to run around uon fireu for the rest of your life?
uGirlu...?
Yeah for the last time I hope.  Im done with this freak show.  Im moving back to the real world.
Showtime.
Recording sir.  We see you perfectly.
Top left like you asked.  Today Wall Street.  Tomorrow who knows...maybe Washington.
Hilarious.
Hes had some kind of...reaction to exposure from the cloud.  And hes not the only one.
Which is precisely the upointu. Analysis is over.  Its time for uactionu.  My men could have mass produced this by now.
Its been changed.
Great minds think alike.
Passion.
We need to get past them.
What...?  uOhu.
Anger.  Rage.  Frustration.
Im sure I can come up with something.
Are you kidding?
No.  There werent.  There was uyouu. And umeu.  No variables no math.  It was actually the simplest thing in the world.  But your head got in the way... like it always does.
Every variable but uyourselfu.  You dont eat sleep.  You cant live in your head like 
Right of course the company... But you see Ive come to realize all the accomplishments in the world mean nothing without someone to share them with 
Susan.  What are you doing?
We understand your concern but weve made our decision Doctor. Any questions? Anybody?
Phase Two.
The less time the better.
In his comatose state...and everything slowed down...no more than sixty seconds.
Message to Proteus.
It means killing Benes...  And for all we know they may have completed the operation  Damn it to hell
The Other Side got to him.
What can I do? Except maybe pass out?
And take a little trip with them...
Grant our Miniaturizer can shrink anything.
Yes...slowed down agreat deal.
It must have been jarred loose during the whirlpool.
Yes Cora.
No danger of an embolism. At our reduced scale theyre much too minute to prove fatal to Benes.
Ive been with him since I got out of school. He brought me into the CMDF over five years ago.
Not working for someone like Dr. Duval 
I always thought it was nothing but red.
As obvious as that? Our Security people will jump for joy.  I suppose Duvals onto me too?
Depends on which end of the telescope you look through.
Not in a sealed vessel like an Artery.  Captain  something must be wrong with your controls
Yes...
Take a close look at your Soul and your Infinity and your God out there 
You left something out.
Oxygenation...
Then why not take it?
Surgical assassination? But that means you suspect 
How are you Miss Peterson?
It lays down quite a barrage in a lifetime. Forty million beats.
If those Corpuscles can take on air no reason why we cant.  All we have to do is hook up the snorkel to that air chamber you were talk1ng about and when Benes inhales there should be plenty of pressure to force the oxygen into the tank.  Hows that sound to you Skipper?
Walt for the lull  between the time he inhales and exhales.
Theyll still be able to track us by radar because of the radioactive fuel.
Send the following message...
His Pleuras in fine condition. It should be clear sailing through this area.
You still never know whats going on in anyones mind...
Two in a row?
Once times up DeMiniaturization begins. In a matter of seconds the ship will grow big enough to become a danger to the System. Then White Corpuscles will swarm to destroy it as they would any invader.
I thought I was on my vacation... Whats it all about?
It should work  theoretically. If it doesnt the missions off. The crafts nuclearpowered. Except for your wireless.
Positions please. And strap yourselves in.
Enough to breathe but thats all.

Six months ago Bobs testicles were removed.  Then hormone therapy.  He developed bitch tits because his testosterone was too high and his body upped the estrogen.  That was where my head fit  into his huge sweating tits that hung enormous the way we think of Gods as big.
Some of it yes.

So you called me up because you just wanted to have a drink before you... go find a hotel?
Youre welcome.  But I want you to do me one favor.

Only a hummingbird could have caught Tyler at work.

Where do you want it?  In the face?
Like hell.  That counted.
Call what off?
After I graduated I called him long distance and asked Now what?  He said Get a job.  When I turned twentyfive I called him and asked Now what?  He said I dont know. Get married.
A generation of men raised by women. Im wondering if another woman is the answer we really need.
What car?
Soldier of Fortune.  Business Week. New Republic.
He was obviously able to handle it.
Yes I promise.
The liberator who destroyed my property has realigned my paradigm of perception.
No what youre feeling is premature enlightenment.
Fuck damnation.  Fuck redemption.  We are Gods unwanted children with no special place and no special attention and so be it.
Imagine how he feels.
You know what I mean.
What are you doing?
Nothing.
If the applicant waits at the door for three days without food shelter or encouragement then he can enter and begin training.
Why do people think Im you?
Why do people think Im Tyler Durden?
Answer me Tyler.

And sometimes you control it...
But when you fall asleep I do things without you...

Stop finishing...
Since when is Project Mayhem about murder?
If you know I know.
I think this is about where we came in.
i... ann....iinn.. ff....nnyin...
Fifteen seconds now.  Can you see alright?  10... 9... 8....
Paraffin.  Your merry band mixed the nitro with paraffin.  I saw it floating in the bomb. 
Why what?
I swear on my life I wont...
You told me youd say that.
What he wanted?  Look... look at him. Look at him  What does he want?  This is a person.  This is not a cog in your machine...
No please no God no
I had a premonition about the Route 18 pile up... I saved some people. And now I think Death is after me.
Signs?
You were there?
Then it wasnt just a sign. It was a premonition?
What happened when Eugene tried to kill himself out of turn?
I dont think so.  Alexs premonitions happened exactly as he saw them no matter how much we tried to change it.
Speed up.
I have to save Eugene
Taken care of.
Random sure.
Your entire world view just went out the window.  I couldnt expect a religious conversation overnight. Well get through this.  I promise.
Thats why Death is working backwards. Its tying up all the loose ends sealing the rift once and for all This chapter of the screenplay contains scene that do not appear or occur elsewhere in the final movie. In order to maintain the integrity of the screenplay it has not been edited.
Carter.
What about you Kimberly?  Did you anyone from Flight?
Yeah.  Who does he think he is? Knight Rider?
Blow me.  Yellow means go Kimmy.

Evan Shaeffers dead.
We have to tell her shes in danger
Who is this guy anyway?
Yeah dont make me cite you for harassment.
Get ready to smile five guys per girl.
How does a nice mature fuck sound?
Highway to Hell Highway to Hell.
I dont know whats weirder the dialing a wrong number part or that Death would set you up nine months in advance.
You have everything Kimberly? Credit card cell phone AAA card?
Hey Dad.  Whats up?
Who am I David Blane?
Jeez Mom stop trippin.
Ive never dealt with death before. I wasnt alive when my grandparents died. I wish I could know. I mean all this... could just be in our heads. Now it feels like its everywhere.
Ohmygod OHMYGOD  OHMYGOD  Hes not dead?
Easy Billy just open it.
Get out Get out of the car
I wish you were on the plane
I dont.
Look theres something you should all know.
Dude get wisdom. Were about to board a seven hour flight. The toilets in coach are barely ventilated closets. What if your body wants that airplane food out of your system and you have to go torque a wicked cable and then right after you walks in Christa or Blake?  You want them to associate with you with that reflexive gag and the watery sting in their eyes?
Oh youve noticed it too?
Billy Im gettin a vision  Youre the next one...
Cause if you say another word Im gonna fuckn kill ya
No ones that strong.
May as well go out under my own free will right?
Thats right buddy.
Clown?  Now back up there buddy...
This is stateoftheart firepower.
Wheres your stuff?
There are no worse places.
Who cares?  Lets just do it and get out.  Go have a Jacuzzi and get laid in Bangkok.  Know what I mean?
Alright.  Home run.
Bastards.  Lets get some shots.
I suppose you have...
You take pictures and split.  Im going in.
I go up to this camp two months ago. Nobody there.  Empty for years.
They heard about escaped prisoner on radio.  Make deal.  More than we pay.
Rambo.  NVA coming.  Pig dog Kinh say meet them here.  Whole garrison from Con Cuong is out.
Took bus most of way.  I knew you would come here.
Carefully.  Dont want to get shot by you.  Bad karma.  Anyway you need me.
How?
Lets get that tent down
Well if there werent POWs before there are now.
Im authorized to get you out of here.  I thought thats what you wanted.
Classic special forces op... hit fast... in and out.  Two men.  Two days.
Not yet.
We just take pictures?
I was crossedtrained in gunships.
Thats right.
Sir theres something else... a TRANSAT relay.  Just came through.
About 22 hours on site.
The League of Families leans on Congress.  Then they lean on us. Like we dont have enough to worry about in a dozen dirtwater countries.  Damnit
It was clean.  Very clean... Rambo was a decorated Vietnam vet a former POW himself... if he came out and said No POWs the subcommittee would buy it.  He gets himself caught hes a private citizen a whacko acting on his own.  If he gets proof it gets lost somewhere between here and D.C.  Airtight. But no... Rambos gotta be a hero. Thinks hes starring in his own war movie or something.  He put me in a corner.  No choice.
Thats a crock.  We dont say that. Do you have any idea the shitstorm if hed gotten back with that guy? If it went public?  The White House would have to act through channels. Were talking ransom.  Four billion bucks in war reparations to Vietnam to get the others back.  Thats billion Colonel.  With a B.  For a few guys thatve had their brains in a blender for ten years?  A pain in the ass to everybody?  No way. Theres no way.
Ah... I do them myself.  I used to work in a beauty parlor.
That all depends on you. ...Sure you dont want a drink?
This foods delicious.  Youre a wonderful cook.  And you have a lovely home.

Well if every time someone did something offensive they hit in the head with a pebble I think they might alter their behavior. What do you think Jack...
Fifty dollars?
Well what am I gonna do with it?
Who?
Bingo
Bad example. Just trust me. A woman who loves you keeps you going...gives you strength... Makes you feel like you can do anything...

No as a matter of fact you didnt. What about the girl Zuzu Petals how does she fit in?  I mean she is what this case is about.
Make eye contact when you say that.
Suure.  Two people hired me to find Zuzu in order to get hold of one of those discs and Colleen threw a tizz when we took hers.  Obviously all this binary disc shit is pretty mighty.  But its not necessary.  People are dead.  One was a friend.  The same people were involved in a scam to rip off Grendel Records. Bottom lines Julian Grendel is doing a little revenge number...

But they have to be warned Sheriff.  Jason will return to the area thats familiar.  No matter what you call it its still Camp Crystal Lake to him.
They coulda danced a jig on it an fed it to goats  dont matter.  Ya cant kill Jason by gettin rid of his body.  Hell come back the way he always do to drag the kiddies into the darkness and crush their little skulls  maybe even your skull Mr. Campbell.
Skin stretcher was human.

The truth?  That Josh a man Ive trusted with my own life on more than one occasion  let me see if Ive got the order right here  tried to rape Diana...got the back of his head blown off...took a poker through the gut...fell through a plate glass window and then magically disappeared into the night.

Disgusting?  Bingo night was sold out for six months after that  They raised enough money to build a day care center.
Sounds good. I hear theres a shuffleboard court on deck  it might be kinds cool...
Rennies not coming.
Its...dead.
Jim Miller and Suzy Donaldson never showed up. Im a little concerned.
And neither do you. Its up to Rennie to decide what she wants to do.
That lunatic has been spouting off about Jason since we boarded...  Its no coincidence.
Shes locked safe in her room no thanks to either of you.  Has he brought it back on course yet?
Hes the son of the Captain for Chrissakes. Youd think hed be able to operate this thing
You can and you will Swim Rennie

Very bad today.
Thats where I peed.
Paisley Porter. I didnt know you were waiting tables.
Shut up Elliot.
Dont needle me Elliot. Tell me how bad you feel. Were suppose to feel bad together. This is what friends do.
It is just a review. Do not inhale. Very dangerous.
Before his Broadway days. He reviewed the oneact I did at the Fulton Fish Market. We did this play at four AM outdoors in the rain. One performance. For the fish handlers.
Where is it?
Paisley Porter.
About an hour and a half ago. I saw her come out of a place. She said she was visiting a friend. But she wouldnt tell me who.
She was very evasive.
What are you talking about?
This could be it.
Our Peter?
The Red Sox blow a chance to win their first World Series since 1918. You expect me to miss that for an opening night?
I go to college. I thought you knew.
Thats completely crazy.
And he hears it the same time I hear it? What happened to family secrets?
I have a class. Im late.
First you tell me.
And Peter Redmond helped immensely. These pauses were exquisitely timed. He made us wait and wait. He built a gorgeous tension and suspense.
We stranded five runners in the first two innings. This will come back to haunt us.
You know why dont you? Because I am patient chainsmoking Lillian.
Thats very lovely actually.
Nicky no. This is insupportable. How could you?
This could be it
It was rummy not poker. But Ill take a chance and let you in.
Fives not so many. There were families with seven kids. A grandmother. A dimwit uncle.
Theyre only gonna lose.
The Red Sox are your problem. I never understood about you and the Red Sox. Everybody rooted for the Yankees.
Since when did that matter?
My back is killing me.
I cant find it.
Normal boys ambition. I like coming back. You know that.
Show him who we are.
The most charming gangster in New England. Where are we going Mr. Lazzaro?
He does bless me each and every day. Matthews mother works a hospital shift so I pick him up at school. We stop for a meal usually around this time. He does his homework and gets some experience meeting people. But we never had a famous mobster before.
Wife and daughter. My fathers still alive. He outlives me starting tonight. Because the Mets just tied the score. It was only a matter of time wasnt it?
I dont know Toyota. What does he do?
Winning is easy. Losing is complicated. Its a lifetimes work.
I want to say it because my whole life may depend on these next few moments.
No. Theyre not your team. Theyre my team.
Youre out of bullets.
Joanna loves this play. She has sunk tons of money. She is completely Ncommitted.

They are boys.  And theyre Indian.
Are you sure?
I will follow you in all our vows and duties.
Jinnah has  has cooperated with the British. It has given him power and the freedom to speak and he has filled the Muslims with fears of what will happen to them in a country that is predominantly Hindu.  That I find hard to bear  even in prison.
Im simply going to prove to Muslims there and Hindus here that the only devils in the world are those running around in our own hearts  and thats where all our battles ought to be fought.
Yes. Ive  Ive met some very remarkable people in India... and  and when I read what youve been doing here I  I wanted to help.  Does that surprise you?
I think you do.  But I thank God we all dont.
No no  just a moment please.
I thought you were against fighting.
The Governments afraid and they dont know what to do. But theyre more afraid of terrorists than of you. The Viceroy has agreed to your release if you will speak for non violence.

A customer?  Does this Michaels cater to misfits?
Its still possible the eyelash specimen came from a janitor delivery manit could have blown in through an open window.
Luca could still be an accomplice.
We have to be certain.  Once theyre up we can hardly turn the boat around.
What a relief.
Thank you no.
No but since there arent too many ilivei ones tonight either you wont mind us conducting one further sweep.  If he does not work here then there should be no other trace of him.  I think youd better get some people out of bed Detective.  In the meantime we can recheck his favorite haunt.
Listen I dont want you to think Im ungrateful I know you and that little brokerwhat do you call him?
Where is your head Jerome?  Youre acting like a guilty man.  They wont marry the eyelash to you.  They wont believe that one of their elite navigators could have suckered them for the last five years.
Shes already got her doubts.  I have to act like nothings wrong.
You may as well invite her here.
Have you forgotten?  I dont need any samples where Im going.
We want himwe were hoping he would get married and have children.  Wed like grandchildren.
Antonio the choir...

If we make a mistake. hell burn us. You make a deal youre always better keeping your end up.
You sent me to him.
It isnt another boyfriend is it?
No... theres a couple of things Im still working on.

I say Can a peas my ass thats a ritz cracker with chopped liver. Go get me a salami sandwich and a glass of wine or Ill send you and your white jacket to the dry cleaners
Mio fratello.
Its all right.  He stays with me all the time.
Id like to come along.  Theres been a lot of strain and Ive been cooped up in this room for three days.
You know her drives me crazy one minute shes a popsicle the next shes all vinegar.  Sometimes I think... I think  I should a married someone like you did.  To have kids to have a family.
No I didnt know.  Is he dead?
 And he agreed?
Im going to see my parents.
You dont know thats true.  But Kay just for the sake of an argument lets assume it is Im not saying it is remember but... What if I gave you what might be some justification for what he did... or rather some possible justification for what he possibly did.
Yes.
I dont know.
I was in my house.  Willy tried but it would have taken some strongarm to stop her and he figured you wouldnt want that.
I cant let him down.
Yeah give me a minute.
But your people... Neri... Rocco you dont think...
But if youre wrong...
My information is that Fredo thought it was a kidnapping.  Roth assured him nothing would happen to you.
It was a boy.
Roth engineered it Michael.  He made Pentangeli think you hit him. Deliberately letting him get off alive.  Then the New York detectives turned Frankie over to the FBI.  My informants say he was half dead and scared stiff  talking out loud that you had turned on him and tried to kill him.  Anyway they had him on possession dealing in heroin murder one and a lot more. Theres no way we can get to him and youve opened yourself to five points of perjury.
His medical condition is reported as... quotterminal.quot
That plane goes to Miami...
Mike its impossible.  Hell be met by the Internal Revenue the Customs Service and half the FBI.
Why do you hurt me Michael?  Ive always been loyal to you.
Mike wants it.
Al as far as youre concerned Im the Don.
The room has a bug in it.
Tom what do I do now?
Yeah I still read a lot.  They bring me stuff.
Thanks Tom.  Thanks.
Actually Ive come with good news the Corleone family has done you a favor.
We know youre a busy man with plenty of enemies  we saw the opportunity to do you a favor and we did.  No strings.
Yes sir.  His name is Vincenzo Pentangeli.
He is I believe a brother.
This meeting is adjourned.
This is my boy and my wife.  Mr. John Ola of Miami.
Michael.
Get out of my hotel.
Your family?  How can you ever lose your family?
It means... quotThe Lie.quot
I saw an interesting thing today. A man was being arrested by the Military Police probably an urban guerrilla.  Rather than be taken alive he exploded a grenade hidden in his jacket taking the command vehicle with him.
Were making a big investment in Cuba.  Thats my only concern.
The money was sent.
Ive read it Im pleased that the government is doing so well.  As a heavy investor Im pleased.  How did the doctor find you?
No Im fine.
So?
Sure I remember Tom from the old days.
That is a complete falsehood.
I do not.
We were all heartbroken at the news but that wasnt cause to start a war.
Then why do you want me to lay down to them?
Im going to squeeze you Corleone because I dont like you I dont like the kind of man you are.  I despise your masquerade and the dishonest way you pose yourself and your fucking family.
No shes here.
We worked it all out beforehand.
You werent straight with us Frankie what else could we do?
We want Brooklyn one hundred percent.  No more taxes to you.  We want to be only loosely connected with your family  sort of a underfamily all of our own.  Then we can act on all internal matters without talking.  Also we want you to inform Michael Corleone that we can deal directly with him.
Then Carmine Fucillo and Tony Blue DeRosa will need to be fitted for slabs.
We got no choice.
Like hell  And who the hell are you to give me orders.  Watch your manners or youll be on your Sicilian ass in the street there.
What was that?
I say let loverboy watch his movie.  And be grateful Boones not cutting Shirley Temples lawn.
Just thinking out loud.
All right then.  Hes interested in you for your conversation.  We know what a great talker you are.
Go wash glasses if you dont like it.
Maybe its supposed to be funny.
Whats to be jealous of?
All the old men I know think about nothing but sex.
Im not a kid.
Is that all this conversation means to you?  Am I going to put out or not?
Im keeping away.  What you are doing is no business of mine.
What kind of man are you?  Are you a good man?
Expect nothing fancy.
Tea is fine.
No.  We live simply Mr. Jimmy and I.  People come to play bridge. And now and then young men to swim.  You have people Boone?
Your wife?
No.  I have children grandchildren too.  I visit when I can.  But now that Mr. Jimmy cannot be left very long I do not get away much.  Poor Mr. Jimmy.  There is much good in him but he will suffer the fires of hell.  Very sad.
No.  His is the worse.  The unspeakable.  The deed no man can name without shame?
There is nothing you can say that will surprise me.
What do I do?
But howre you going to explain this?  How did you get him out of the pool?
Just that I was in the Marines.
You know what they say.  If you have to ask 
In my youth yes but never in Hollywood.  No I was merely a director here.
I made only the first two.  The others were done by hacks.
Whats to sketch?
But why?
You dont want to draw pictures of me in my birthday suit right?
Excellent.  Well have a most interesting time.
Hmmm.  I much prefer Show Boat or The Invisible Man.  Shall we begin?
Your family ate dripping?
I dont mind.  Im not crazy about my old man either.
Pity.  People are so earnest nowadays.
Proud?  Any jerk with a gun can kill someone.
You dont think of me that way do you?
Thoreau with a lawnmower.
What happened?
Youve done a helluva lot more than most people.
I dont know.  I guess I like your stories.
Theres no people like you in my crowd.
You must think the whole world is queer.  Well its not.  War sure isnt.
You dont want me to sit for you anymore?
Do I look okay?
Girl?  Oh.  Elizabeth Taylor.
The only memento I ever kept.  My original sketch for the Monster.
A very lucky thing indeed.
Thats where youre wrong Clayton. Youve just told one.  A very good story indeed.
I dont remember that one.
There are straps in back.
Relax Clayton.  I cant hear you. I cant hear a word.
I havent done a damn thing with you
Oh Clayton.
You only embarrass yourself.
Then who did?
But the rest of it?  The killing headaches.  The phantom smells.  My inability to close my eyes without thinking a hundred things at once. Its all nothing more than bad electricity?
You seem to be saying that this isnt just a case of resting until Im better.  That my condition will continue to deteriorate until the end of my life.
Oh dear.
Yes Mr. Jimmy.  An interview.  After so many years. Very exciting.
Luminal.
She is beautiful.
Id hardly call our yardman a friend.
It must be up in your old room.  I will look.
Is it now?  Hanna?  I think well take our tea down by the swimming pool.
Sure.
Everything.  Start at the beginning.
But its the horror movies youll be remembered for.
No.  I never said you were.  Or will be soon.
Take off your vest and Ill tell you a story.
Maybe youd like a swim when were through.  I never swim myself so the pool tends to go to waste.
Is there someplace we can talk?
Six years ...

The truth was that no matter how bad I felt I was still very attracted to him. Why should I give him up to someone else? Why should she win?
I dont want to hear about her anymore.
I got scared.
Bring the car round back. I know a place Upstate theyll never find him.
I gotta talk to you.
Right away I knew he didnt want them. I knew I was going to get stuck for the money. I only bought the damn guns because he wanted them. And now he didnt want them. I didnt say a thing. Jimmy was so pissed he didnt even say goodbye.
I remember feeling bad about the guy. But I remember feeling that maybe Tuddy was right.  I knew Paulie didnt want anybody dying in the building.

Nonsense Just bad press. All the deaths that occurred inside  my own fathers included  all perfectly normal fatal accidents.
Nothing.
Did it work?
Whats life anyway? Waves...? Sound...? Light...? Electricity...? I dont know... Phone lines...?
Its not going to let us out
Up here 
Over here
Take the gun.
Best of a nightmare.
I thought she was dead. For sure.
Most of my business is making deliveries to high rollers. And I have yet to meet one Executive who could tie their own shoes  let alone rewire an entire house. You dont fit the bill  not even close.
No  keep pulling its moving
 thats the fact bud 
Lets try down here...
Hes gotta still be down here.
Hes dead...?
For chrissake give me a hand
Jesus
Cheer up before the nights through Im sure one of usll get hacked to pieces by somebody or something.

Or somebody wanting me to believe that.
Something with the power I dont know
Not just yet. Would any of you be interested in knowing exactly why I ended up here in the basement?
Well I cant sweetheart.
Dont think so. Stay the fuck back.
Not even for a million dollars Mr. Price.
Maybe it was just its time to finally fall apart.
 guess we know where Mr. Price is now.
Accumulated evil... festering for decades...  But Im a drunk... so dont listen to me.
He mustve unsealed the room
What was her name?
What will they tell you?
Im sorry.
Pearl is the twilight the divinity... Onyx is the sickle death...
Maybe it was Colleen...
Ok...
Go to your room  Now
Hes blessing the house.
Ok ok...were just gonna head inside here...
Yeah Ill look into that tonight.
Whatever you say.
To our family.
Did anyone in your family keep in touch with her?
I dont know.  Thats strange.
I dont know.  Someone who...knows about this kind of stuff.
Voodoo stick?  Its nothing like that Will.  Youre just being cynical.
Im sure this sounds crazy to you.
Know what?
Im ok.
Im all right...
We usually find nothing.  Weve debunked many a reported haunting. About ninety five percent of the cases had some technical explanation.
Youll have to settle for turkey.
Yes I am.
Aubrey?  Its mommy.
Well I believe her mind was playing tricks on her God rest her soul.  She would hear things see things...
Well be there.
It was nailed to the cellar wall.

You have to help me.  You will understand.  And no youre not dreaming.  Do you know where we are?
Captain Spenser.  Elliott.  I ... What the Hell is going on?
And why are you back?  Why are we here?
The Box Joey.  He wants the Box.
Where?
Right.
Guys.  Sometimes friends.  Mostly guys.
No.  I buy them to impress people.  Of course Ive read them.
Maybe not.  But you know more than I do. You know something about this box. Something about a statue?
Would you know this store again?
No.  We want ...
On the contrary.  It has everything to do with the world.  And our dreams of how it will succumb to us.  You enjoyed the girl?
Live and in the flesh.  Howre you doing babe?
I know.  I know.  Its bad.  Im a bad person.  But I try not to be Terri.  I really do.  And I really miss you.
Yeah a girl I know helped smarten it up.  Put her heart and soul into it.
Yes  God yes.  I ... I just want to hug you.  To hold you.  To tell you its alright.
Still do the puzzles still know the running times of songs and Ill bet youre still the best damn cat burg
Now that youre born againwhat do you wanna do?  Statue of Liberty?  Entertain some ladies? Miss Saigon tix?  Seduce some women?  Play Nintendo?  Bone some chicks?
Sure.  Thats why his meatballs are made out of marinated Chuck Wagon.
Hey you promised......Dont worry Im wearing my girdle.
But I said I was sorry....
I cant believe you didnt notice. My weight.  I lost ten pounds in Rome
Its Boston Mr. Mayflower.
Oohkay...
Close call but shes our only way of keeping tabs on that damn mysterious Vatican organization. Hawk its time to go to the principals office....
As for our plan of action anybodyd be insane to go in from the ground floor...
Yeah.  The big E.
Fantastic.  Perfection.  The Vatican extends its jealousy to the lucky bidder.
Does everyone in the world know more than me?  Jesus Im just some guy who happens to be good at swiping stuff.....Lifted a piece of licorice when I was one and a half.  Who knew it would lead... They even got the CIA involved
Uh yeah.  Guess Im a wee bit nervous.  Im sorry I could only score clergy passports.
When the Mayflowers find out we have the Codex theyre going to want to make a deal...
Thats two hundred dollars a day? So he can get a hooker and some tequila.  Veto Darwin.
Like a cat one could say.
Market crashes.  Bomb drops. Greenhouse effect affects.  Well still be the richest most powerful people in the world.  In 1992 Europe is coming together to become one business superpower.  Its one party wed love to poop.
Were here to say your government was right.
You could host American Bandstand in here.  Why did you duck at the auction asshole?
You want an address on that last one?
How was I supposed to know they were women?  Besides one of them was bald and kept saying Soitinly.
Yes.
For Gods sake chain this convict.
Just browsing.  Dont touch me....
Itll take a couple of years of steady production but Ill flood the market with so much gold that gold itself the foundation of all finance will lose its meaning. Brokers economists and fellow entrepreneurs will drown in the saliva of their own nervous breakdowns.  Markets will crash crash.  Financial Empires will crumblecrumble.
You cant convict  Youre just a shmoe  Every shmoe has the fantasy the planet revolves around them.  It rains car crash stops traffic you say How could this happen to me?  Its a natural inclination.  But for I this isnt a fantasy it is urealityu You are on my planet  You walk around the corner for coffee out of my sight you do not fucking exist  The lives of shmoes like you have meaning only in relation to the rich to the powerful to ME
And to think I thought you were Evil Incarnate in pumps.
Bastard  If you were a true American.
Three minutes twentythree seconds.  If you think Im doing another...
Im supposed to fall for that?
They may be scum but if I get the Da Vinci model back then well be roasting weenies on the beach.
Sharp.
What am I a headshrinker? Maybe the man was unhappy.
But then I figured it out they did it cause they figured young Norville for an imbecile. Like some othuh people ah know.
Well in connection with my job sometimes I have to go undercover as it were 
Im happy enough.
He didnt offer you money.
Ten dollars? Lets grab a highball
Youve lost it Aim. Youve gone soft by the looks of it  soft on the dummy from Dubuque 
I dont want to bore you with all the sordid details of my life its not a happy story...
Oh no really I 
Well I... didnt bother to read the article. I didnt think the picture did you justice.
Well I dont know maybe she does deserve it. Maybe she shouldve come in to face you man to man.
Sure but  she could still have gotten your side for the record
Exactly. And I bet shes ugly. Real ugly. Otherwise why wouldnt they print her picture next to her byline?
Didja ever go to the top of old man Larsons feed tower and look out over the town?
You know on farm route 17.
No In Vidalia Farm Route 17
What do you think you were in your previous life Amy?
Well can I at least call you deer? Hahahahaha Seriously Amy the whole thing is what your beatnik friends call karma  the great circle of life death and rebirth.
Thats it. A great wheel that gives us each what we deserve...
Kiss me once Amy Kiss me once for luck
Well yes were pruning away some of the dead wood but if 
Now Aim 
Now Aim 
Norville Im sorry I... I tried to tell you... so many times... Its hard to admit when youve been wrong. If you could just... find it in your heart to  to give me another chance 
Phony huh?
Whatever. Thats what sells newspapers.
He grins wolfishly.
So ya see I wont be in the mailroom long.
I want a martini On this bar right now Ive had a martini in every bar on the way down here and Im not about to 
But buddy you were 
And dont call me buddy Out of here Out
Aw buddy I dont care about that.
Nah thats all forgotten.
Norville.
Ah its New Years Im not gonna add to your woes. Im just saying.
Well why dont ya read it.
...But Sid let me urge you to work closely with the new president and to keep giving Hudsucker Industries all your energies  but not your soul. For while we must strive for success we must not worship it. Long live the Hud. Waring Hudsucker...
Barnes Where the hell have you been And wheres my voucher?
Well Im a college graduate 
Oh my God sir
 So if you think its appropriate Id like to bounce the idea off a few people at lunch 
No Bennie Lumbago.
He dont look wise.
Thank you for waking me.
I know miss.  But I like to do it. I like to tend for Miss Jessica and I want to tend for you.  You settle right back now and Ill mix you your coffee.
TiMisery?  Whats that?
But they came to a beautiful place didnt they?
Use your influence with Paul.  Ask him to take that whiskey decanter off the dinner table.
Thats sweet of you Mrs. Rand.
I dont know.  I prefer to think of her as a sleepwalker who can never be awakened  feeling nothing knowing nothing.
Ive never heard of a cure.
Thank you.
I would have stayed anyway Dr. Maxwell.
Very well.  That means that you have met all Mr. Hollands requirements.  Now as to salary  its quite good  two hundred dollars a month.
A years contract  a trip with all expenses paid  thats not so bad you know.
Thats rather nice isnt it?
Thank you.  But who sits there? 
Higher mathematics.  Two ounces to a drink  three drinks six ounces.
Im a nurse.  I always watch people when they pour something.  I watched TiJoseph and it was exactly two ounces.
Of course Wes.
You read my thoughts Mr. Holland.
Yes thank you.
Yes.  But it was once the figurehead of a slave ship.  Thats where our people came from  from the misery and pain of slavery. For generations they found life a burden. Thats why they still weep when a child is born  and make merry at a burial.
If I were as timid as you seem to think Mr. Holland I wouldnt have gone into the tower in the first place.
Nothing  really.  But you must admit its an eerie sort of place  so dark 
Mrs. Holland must have been beautiful 
Yes he can.  But Ive been wondering  you know if you could leave the whisky decanter off the table 
I love Fort Holland.
Because you wanted to give my wife back to me?  Why should that mean anything to you?
But I had no thought of harming her.  It wasnt I...
It is a hard decision to make  but yours is only a technical responsibility...
Paul were not trying to blame Miss Connell.  It isnt a question of blame.  Its a question of what we are to do with Jessica.  The commissioner is very concerned.
In view of all the circumstances the commissioner has decided on a legal investigation.
Got a meeting uptown.
Clair George Clair What the hell brings you to New Canaan?
And as usual no one believed me...
That shrink  the one you always wanted me to see? I thought you dropped him.
You want to go?
Well it is a neighborhood tradition.
Hmm. Good night.
You know Elena Ive been thinking
What else could I be? What else could I be? Were not living in the real world here. Youre living out some fantasy land from the past or some advice or something from those psychoanalysts... there are some hard facts here.
Sure I do. Do I know what loneliness feels like? Sure I do. I know a lot about it if thats what you mean.
Ben Ive got a ride home. Maybe you should sleep this one off on the couch here?
Sure. Ill try. And well talk in the morning?

Jesus all right enough
Huh?
And why are you still calling me dad? Youre forty years old already and 
Thats besides the point.
Advice? Im supposed to be getting the stock tips from you Ben. Unless  have you quit your job? They fired you?
 Your mother God bless her stood by me for fortytwo years  we never once contemplated divorce  I assume youre talking here about divorce? The very thought 
 Waiter Wheres my cobb salad?  You want advice Ben? If your big brother were still alive Id have him go out into the back yard and beat some sense into your head. Look kid you married that woman against my advice 
Ben Im going to Florida. I hate Thanksgiving and I hate the cold. I have a new nurse. Shes a negro she weighs three hundred pounds and Ive decided to leave my entire estate to her.
I suppose well make an appearance.
Let me.
You couldnt have hoped for much better when you came up the walk.
Well we can talk about it.
Hi Wendy.
We were just riding around.
Its really quite all right.
Social work?
You dont have to apologize. Im too much of a cynic. You actually seem to be trying to figure things out  dont mind me.
They say you never forget.
All well and good  But tell me again what is it exactly that you believe in?
I would say it sounds like youre trying to get me into bed.
Im afraid people around here provide her with quite a bit to gossip about.  Take care.
Perhaps you might find it in your heart to call me Philip?
Sometimes the shepherd needs the company of the sheep.
See ya.
Um Libbets Casey.
My man I speak to you solely as a comrade in arms offering unconditional aid. Ive been giving this one a lot of thought and I believe that the two of you together might just reach that higher ground that 
Hell I guess he takes after me huh?
You know its the whip  the one uncle Frank got me from Mexico.
Sure I do you know like your aura. That you give off.
I dont have a girlfriend.

Mrs. Connell found this copy in the house.  Its signed.  Personally.
Dammit Will.  Warfield had me locked up in his office again for five hours yesterday.  iFivei hours.  Asking all kinds of questions...
But hes zeroing in on imei.  On iusi. Everyones talking about it.
Goddammit Hap.  Think about what youre doing...

She loved me.  She wanted to see me every night.
Friday night at the party  whatd you fight about?
The other guy?
Thats a long time.
Who?

What was it?
Yes.
I didnt want to kill her Will.
Yes and very beautiful.
Are you the leader of tis group?
Nothing if not vampires...
You said there were none.
Yes you are my dearest. You are mine and Louis daughter. You see Louis was going to leave us. He was going to go away. But now hes not. Hes going to stay and make you happy.
I have. Or there would be twice as many.
Stop her Louis
Oh Lestat. I must do more than that. Ive brought a present for you.
No. Laudanum.
What have you done?
Hush Claudia dont talk about such things. Show me your book.
And he found me with you. I ran sickened at what Id done. Then he cut his wrist and fed you from him. I tried to stop him but you were a vampire then. And have been every night hereafter.
It is Take the back stairwell 
No. Shes frightened. She doesnt know where she is.
Be still
What danger?
Thats not so.
Yes...
And a beautiful house it is too. Yours is a good life isnt it?
Ive come to answer your prayers. You want to die dont you? Life has no meaning anymore does it?
They are gone Louis. Death took them. Death which you can now destroy...
Give it to me
Youre the devil arent you? Thats who you are.
I cant go through with it I tell you.
Dying?
Youve killed Louis. And enjoyed it.
And if I dont?
We can live like this? Off the blood of animals?
I dont know any hell 
Come the New Orleans then. Theres an opera on tonight. A real french opera We can dine in splendour
What you wouldnt do. Its almost sunrise. It will be the sun or the fire. You said they can kill me. The sun or the fire
Where do you think my idiot friend? Were in a nice filthy cemetery. Does this make you happy? Is this fitting and proper enough?
I like to do it. I enjoy it. Take you aesthetes taste to purer things. Kill them swiftly if you will but do it For now doubt you are a killer Louis. Ah
Oh God Lestat. I felt peace. I felt an end to the craving.
What are you saying?
Lestat what do you mean?
Dont try to speak... its alright...
I tried...
Yes but you neednt worry about that now. Things change.
Youre not lying to me are you?
The same. As you would say today... Bull shit.
Can a vampire feel love?
I was human then. Might as well ask can an angel feel love. Both are blesses or cursed with a certain... detachment. Though whether angels take as long to learn it as I I will never know.
Where would she have gone? She was a child and beautiful heartbreaking merciless child. And I had made her that...
He hadnt even been there. And all those years I thought he was dead.
Au contraire monsieur I have.
What do you think she is Madeleine? A doll?

No.
Tyrell I appreciate it but have you seen my people dance? We make the mouth face we move the fingers 
Julie people who end up making rules like that end up beating their kids with wire hangers. Its a fact.
I think we can classify this as an emergency situation.
Rio isnt the capital of Brazil. It was the wrong answer. Sorry we lose.

And do what with it?
Estes Thats exactly who it is. That old guy knows something. We can sit here and wait for him to pick us off or we can go find him first.
You collect these to sell abroad?
He wont even know youre there. He is delirious.
I must meet him with laughter  with songs and laughter  to show him I am not afraid 
All the graves?

I think she went to bed  I saw her going toward the house
Poor Cathy

She has never mentioned her family.
How kind you are. It is so comforting to know that someone cares.
That your father and I 
Would you care to explain what youre talking about?
I wanted to be sure of something General  something that has always preyed on my mind. I have a horror of being buried alive and awakening to find myself shut in  entombed  imprisoned..
I dont understand you.
If you should fall sick well be careful. You need not worry.
Never fear  when you are dead you will remain dead. I will see to it that you do not walk about again. I promise you that. There is another one here who can not die. I will watch you both. Never fear.
Nothing really. Shes been under a great strain  the journey  the battle

Cant help you Mike.  Dont have the manpower.
Its easy.  Put a net on the derrick.  Put the net in the water by the intake passage. Turn off the intake passage. Shark comes out into the net and is hauled up.
Coming with us?  Overmans buying.

I dont know  hows dedication for an answer?
I missed ya.  What can I say?

Not a chance.
What DO you stand for???
Dont be silly.
Im freakin out.  Oh God Im 
Stay calm?  Im freakin...
The best commercial director in the business.  I hail you.
I came here to let you go.  27.
I know.  It sucks.  I suck.
Aw the fucking thing... I mean the zoo is closed.
Well go to the zoo sometime. Okay? I think I might have some time on my hands.
Funny.
Right up ahead buddy 
Weve arranged for a private airplane to take us flying over Isla Sorna. And we want you to be our guide.
What?
A friend. We were vacationing. Eric wanted to see the island and the dinosaurs so Ben found a guy who would take them parasailing. They never came back.
People change.
Dr. Grant says this Dr. Grant says that...
Nothing.
No its...
Its not about him. Its Eric. Hes alone out here somewhere. Our baby is all alone.
We have to help him.
I want to find them too but we cant do a bit of good right now. For every scary thing we saw in the daylight Ill bet there ten times more of em at night.  Am I right?
Were not going anywhere I promise.
Im trying That thing took him down this way
Here
What about Eric and Dr. Grant?
Just hold on.
I know. I know. I want to look for him too.
He loves you too.
Sure.
Theyre here.
No way. This is lucky. Couple years ago some buddies and I went hang gliding off these cliffs in New Zealand. Updraft sent me right into the side. BOOM
It was this strap alone that saved my life. Got caught on a rock as I was falling.
Mr. and Mrs. Kirby If you look out the right you can see...
Obviously a superpredator.  Suchimimus. that snout.
Sorry Alan its been six years.
Really?  What do you do there?
You think they could talk to each other?
Goodbye Alan.
Youd be surprised what people can do when they have too.
Which one do you prefer?
Are you sure?
Shes the one person I could always count on. And shes saved me more times than she realizes. I owe her everything.
You should.
There is. I own a place called Kirby Paint and Title Plus. Were out in the Westgate Shopping Center in Enid Oklahoma. The plus is for bathroom fixtures fireplaces accessories patio furniture. Stuff like that.
Back out Move
Just a little bit too much I think.
Minimal.
It doesnt matter what I think.
Because I didnt know  I dont have the faintest idea what theyre doing here.
Well?  Didnt it all seem a trifle compact to you?
After the accident at the park a hurricane wiped out our facility on Site B.  We had to evacuate and leave the animals to fend for themselves. And they did.  For four years Ive fought to keep them safe from human meddling now I want you to go there and document them.
Ian you are my last chance to give something of real value to the world. I cant walk so far and leave no footprints die and leave nothing with my name on it.  I will not  be known only for my failures.  And you will not allow yourself to go down in history as a lunatic.  Youre too smart.  Youe too proud.  Dr. Malcolm.  Please.  This is a chance at redemption.  For both of us. Theres no time to equivocate we must seize it now before 
 my 
Dr. Malcolm  the world  owes you an apology.
Kelly  What are you doing here?
That was about a year ago.
Out of the question.  Youd miss the gymnastics trials.  Youve been training for that for a year.
This is nothing like Austin.  Forget about it.
Where does it say that?
You heard his Dieter.  Find a new spot.  And remember were after herbivores only  no unnecessary risks.
To collect my fee.
I once saw a bull elephant die charging a jeep.  All the jeep had done was startle the bulls calves. I saw a lioness carry wounded prey four and a half miles all the way back to its den just to teach its cubs how to finish off a kill.
Rex wont be any different.  Itll come.
The velociraptors.
Good.
Let it go Peter.  The animal won.
Do me a favor.  Dont pretend for a second that you and I dont know the truth.  You can convince Time magazine and the Skeptical Inquirer of whatever you want but I was there.
Dont ask me.  The guys completely out to lunch.
Wheres Kelly?
Funded by whom?
Ian if we recall the boat now weve made two invasive landings in one day.  Thatll have to go in any paper I write and it will leave room for people to say our findings were contaminated.  You know the academic world as well as I do once they smell blood in the water youre dead.  Our presence has got to be one hundred percent antiseptic.  That means if we bend a blade of grass we bend it right back the way it
Runs against my nature to hole up in a cave and wait.
Rotten luck this storm.  Get my grandchildren on the radio will you?  I dont want them to worry about a wee bit of rain.
Yeah again in  theory but  
Dodgson Dodgson.  We got Dodgson here  See nobody cares.  Nice hat. What are you trying to look like a secret agent?
I was wondering how are you planning to beat the security?
Shhhhh
Are you sure?
Oh my God.
Oh my God.
A carousel   and a seesaw.  They all moved motorized of course but people would swear they could see the fleas.  I see the fleas mummy  Cant you see the fleas? Clown fleas high wire fleas fleas on parade... 
Thats good.  Thats right  They died around a driedup puddle  Without fighting each other.  This is looking good.
Oh Ellie look.  Theyre noisy theyre messy theyre sticky theyre expensive.
They do smell.  Some of them smell.. babies smell.
The Cretaceous.
Yeah plenty.  Some of them cant walk
Uh this is our paleobotanist Dr Ellie.....
What kind of park is it?
We were right
Were out of a job.
Dilophosaurus.
Its my favorite.
Yes unless they figured out how to open doors.
I cant get it  I cant get it unless I move
The fences are electrified right?
The other car
Whats that?
You cant just stroll down the road you know.
Okay.
Well discuss sexism in survival situations when I get back.  You just take me through this step by step.  Im on channel two.
Like hell it is
I get ah  
It changed.  Why?  Okay back over your wrist.  Because and here is the principle of tiny variations   the orientations of the hairs  
Microscopic   never repeat and vastly affect the outcome.  Thats what?
No one could have predicted Dr. Grant would suddenly jump out of a moving vehicle
Juanito if they pull the funding that will really slow things down.  If they pull the funding thats going to slow things down around here.
Grant?  Youll never get him out of Montana.
Because hes like me.  Hes a digger.
And the concrete moats and the motion sensor tracking systems.  Donald dear boy do try to relax and enjoy yourself.
Tim.  Which car were you planning on  
Triceratops was a constant browser and constant browsers would be constantly sick.
Thats okay.  Listen give me your hand.
This is impossible.  How am I going...I cant make it. This is...its about fifty feet.
Its so strong  Look at its nose.  Need help?
Youre crazy  Im not gonna jump
You have no idea.
You havent touched  didnt touch anything.  Were stopping.  Weve stopped.
You want to talk about this?
For today I guarantee it.
What kind of opinions?
The brachiosaur?  Thirty.
Wu?
Dr. Grant  Dr. Grant
No I didnt hear anything.  No were okay.
Oh I hate the other kind.
Its okay  Its okay  Its a brachiosaur
Codswollop  Ian youve never come close to explaining these concerns of yours about this island
Dr. Grant Dr. Sattler  youve heard of Chaos Theory?
John the kind of control youre attempting is not possible.  If theres one thing the history of evolution has taught us its that life will not be contained. Life breaks free.  It expands to new territories.  It crashes through barriers.  Painfully maybe even.. dangerously but and...well there it is.
Youre all right John Youre okay.  Its just you dont have intelligence.  You have thinktelligence.  You think narrowly and call it being focused.  You dont see the consequences.  Youre very good at solving problems at getting answers   but you just dont know the right questions.
Im sorry about your financial problems.  I really am. But they are your problems.
Theres no sign of him anywhere.
Sure.
Excellent.
Turn it off Lex  Turn it off
Shut up  Youre scaring me.  Stop  Youre scaring me.
Do you think they like the fact that tourism has dropped ninetyeight percent in the last ten years?
Logging? Well need an environmental impact study for that...
Great.
Yeah. Ken said there was another guy there... big guy... then he dropped the phone. Whats going on?
Thats my job.
I know how this sounds but thats what happened.
What?
No. When you put me on the stand Ill say your client is catatonic and exhibits classic symptoms of a schizophrenic sociopathic personality.  And he doesnt sleep.
None of thats true?
Youre obviously going through a critical moral dilemma. And youre putting up barriers against anyone who tries to probe your conscience.  But it is heartening to know that you do have a conscience.
Now.... according to the file Krueger was burned to death in a fire in 1968. But get this  beginning in 1984 there was another series of murders in Springwood. All teenagers... all killed in their sleep... all killed with finger blades just like Kruegers.
Dont you see? Jason was asleep. And he was dreaming  the REM patterns prove that. And I saw finger blades just like Kruegers come out of Jasons chest. There has to be a connection.
Great.When can you do it?
Hows that possible?
Alone... but with a murderous fury inside him... which led him to kill dozens of people.
Except this victim got away. I wonder if 
I used to go hunting with my father when I was a kid.
What is it really?
What was the matter with it?
You were his friend.  One link is all they need.
 Small.
I dont know what you could have read.
I havent got the energy.  I mean I have to conserve my energy.
There is uoneu thing Id like you to tell me.
What made you think uIdu be able to get you into the Castle?
In a manner of speaking.
No I left it in his office.
Youre detestable.
You must make the time.  Where do you go off to in the lunch hour?
Have you never wondered  and I mention this only in passing   why other clerks have advanced to more responsible positions while you who have been here longer have not?
 Yes  Raban  but he was too much like you  even more so perhaps.  He wasnt here as long as you so I didnt know him as well  but I could see the influence he was having.  I simply want you to be aware of this because youll be happier for it.
I know.
Why would you suppose so?
This morning it was suggested to me that my own sense of office fellowship could bear improving.
Two or three months thats all.   I seduced him.
Eduard didnt see it as something that needed bearing.
Last year.  I  it was broken off.
You wont have any trouble finding it.
Theyre ubiquitous.  What we try to do ... is make them a little less so.
People must think the same of me  a quiet dependable person.
Why were you given notice?
Now Burgels one of the authorities?
Theres a new potion  he said it was perfected.
Wednesday.  We left the office together.
No we said goodbye outside the building.  He went off as usual toward his house.
No I suppose not.
Thats not what I call conclusive evidence of an abduction.
Its all right to be sarcastic in private to us  because we have a sense of humor  but when were up at the Castle we suggest you dont make a fuss.  It would spoil the not unfavorable impression you make in other respects.
When a scapegoat is needed my friend ...
A mere slip.  Your friend Mr. Raban dealt only with claims that came uinu another department being responsible for compensation that goes out  this is correct?
... A piece of paper ...
It usually is.
Whenever an employee departs shall we say its up to the head of his department to requisition his file reassign any outstanding claims and send it off.
Dr. Murnau was the bravest of men. He spent an entire career in those backwaters with no regard for personal gain.  A great loss.
These laws have been with us for centuries  how can you doubt them?
My mother used to tell us of the young man who decided to ride to the next village and how she was afraid that  not even mentioning accidents  the span of a normal happy life might fall far short of the time needed for such a trip.
Its ... lovely.
To be quite honest Mr Denham ... I find the whole idea to be quite reprehensible.
Now Ann ...
I photographed it extensively father.
Now now Ann Try be to polite.
You  calling me a thief? Well thats great coming from a glorified grave robber You break into the tomb of some dead Egyptian  the poor guys happily enjoying the afterlife when suddenly his shit gets stolen by a bunch of light fingered limeys
I dont know what happened to you Jack ... but I cant believe you were always this much of a bastard.
Ann ... youre father is dead. You have nothing to prove anymore.
A man eater Fantastic  Making history Herb
Jack ... You get to save the girl and I get my third act Its gonna be good for you and good for me
Yeah? ... Well I gave em a taste of American lead ... and I dont see em coming back for seconds
What?
How about Ann? Is she going with you?
Yeah.
Arlyn he just wanted to ask some questions  something you could help us about.
She was with you after she left Frank.
And then one night  at the gaming tables  well I just saw him. A stranger  looking at me  and I knew suddenly that all my life Id been 
Please 
Yes?
You think people hate you.
No.
No thats not 
Mm.
No Im look 
Look  Im sorry  Ive led everybody wrong. I mean yes I get those feelings but thats just me thats just feelings.  Im sure this will amuse you Im scared of the dark. And sometimes I get shook up I hear people or  well Ill come out in the morning and think someones been prying at my mailbox or theres a little  trash outside my door and I wonder if someone left it there for  do you see?  things other people wouldnt even notice. Well thats not real its just nerves its got nothing to do with 
OK.
I go on rounds.
What do you think?
No.
You told me what you could. I guess Im through with your part of it.
I dont see anything do you?
No I said what did you think.
Oh dont be all hypocrite. Or do you really like other kicks? Is it more just having power over someone?  so you dont really need to 
Frankie kept them in the same apartment it cut his traveltime.
Arlyn had a very big habit  heroin  shes the one who started Frank. Shes strung out now you wont find her.
 Then you dont need me.
I dont get you.
I dont like getting splashed.
Mm.
What am I supposed to say?
Dont touch anything.
OK.
I could try Arlyn Page again. She saw much more of the Dumper than Bree Daniel.
How is it back there?
Well as a matter of 
Yeah.
Dumper the man Bree Daniel mentioned and Arlyn Page knew and Jane McKenna knew.
Someones been doing all these things.
Pete Ive got a chance to buy Jane McKennas black book.
Callgirls generally keep a book you know a list of their clients. Sometimes if a girl retires shell even sell it worth good money. Jane McKenna had a black book when she died it was stolen. Ive been after it a long time.
It probably has the Dumpers name. It might give us some kind of new lead.  I want a look at it anyhow.
Tomorrow. See you tomorrow night.
Its not so bad.
No. They never did really. But thats what Im going to recommend. The next step. Unless something 
Goodbye Pete.
Two years ago? Sorry.

Why does he decide?
Sustained.
Yes your honor.
Does the witness deny the injury took place?
Six years.
Yes I work for Jantzen as a sportswear designer.
Your honor I would like to place in evidence a report on Mrs. Kramers therapy by her therapist Dr. Elinore Freedman of La Jolla California.
Can you recall any particular incident that relates to Mr. Kramers care of his child?
Your honor Im only examining the mans employment record.  He pretends to fitness when he cannot hold a job.
Thank you.  I have no further questions.
What?  What do you mean I dont understand.
How many lovers have you had permanently?
Ted Im leaving you.
Okay okay...What is it this time? What did I do now?...
Im listening Joannabelieve me Im listening.  My wife is walking out on me after eight years of
Such as?
I mean it Ted youre running this one.
Im going to be okay.  The way I see it Joannall come home its just a matter of time.
I dont know Jim...
Jim I appreciate what youre saying.  I mean it but I really think Joannas coming back.
Hey Ted.  Cmon in.  I wanna talk to you.
Murray had some ideas about the Fire and Ice campaign and he had the art department make up a few roughs...  I think theyre kind of interesting.
Thats my decision Ted and thats final.
Are you firing me Jim?
Sure.
Mmmmnph...Ill get you a cab...
Right.
Im going to take it.
But its not a year from now is it?
Walk him over to Bethesda Fountain buy him an ice.  Itll kill twenty minutes.

Oh Christ.. .John theres some thing I ought to tell you.  My... ah situation has...changed.  I lost my job.
Ted I wont lie to you we dont have a hope in hell of winning a custody hearing if youre out of work.
Ted all I wanted to know was where
No.
Ted divorce is a terrible thing. I know I went through it. Youve got to believe I did everything I could to get Joanna to stay.  But Ill tell you something. You may not want to hear it but it took a lot of courage for Joanna to do what she just did.
Thelma Ive lost my wife Im not losing my child.
Got it.
No not really...  I guess its different if you dont have children but...I dunno even if Charley and I dont live together even if were sleeping with other people even if Charley was to marry again...Hed still be my husband. That stuff about Till death do you part?  Thats really true.
Look  I know this isnt gonna make any sense okay?  I mean forget the logic part...But I keep thinking if Charley really loved me he wouldnt have let me divorce him.
Ted I just heard...
Kham Holiness.
Again?
Can I do anything I want?
Here. Well collect them.
You have cracked a mans skull and that crack has not healed. It is too soon to expect him to be your friend.
To protect. To serve you. Chairman Mao wants you to feel that China belongs to you now.
I will not approve it.
And we will begin with tearing it down.
General Chiang.
Soon.
We did not.
Yes. Most of the Chamdo region is now in Chinese hands. There is a report from Chamdo which makes quite clear that unless some settlement can soon be reached Communist troops will soon be marching on Lhasa.
Yes.
At dawn you were born. One eye was closed and your sister opened it with her thumb. We gave you the sweet drink.
I miss my brother.
What do you think?
I am him.
Please.
Can India help us?
The radio contact said one officer had died. Then he said The Chinese soldiers  they are coming. And then the radio went dead.
The Communists put their guns in the hands of the Khamba children and force the child to kill the parent. They have dropped bombs on the monastery of Lithang in Kham. It has been destroyed. Women and children trying to escape from the fighting have been shot with machine guns fired from airplanes.
I will not go.
Arrange for me to speak to the peoples leaders.
He was always nice to me. He found me. He saw me in his dreams.
You will always
Does he have the spot?
True.
Reting Rinpoche has been arrested. He tried to overthrow Regent Taktra. Today he is brought back to Lhasa by government officials. The monks at Sera Monastery have been on his side. Now there is trouble between them and the army.
And you have grown older and your chin has grown balder.
They think they have convinced me. They think I am on their side. They have allowed me to leave Kumbum and come to Lhasa believing that I will try to turn you to their ways. If I do not succeed I am to eliminate you.
Do you remember the day I came to your monastery when I was a baby? And you comforted me?
Buddha teaches that we must learn from our enemy. We have compassion for all people.
The land has stayed in the family. We work together. The nobleman is not too bad.
Oh yes.  I killed him.
Nobody ulivesu on this lake.  its really uhisu lake now.

Dr. Chilton I told you  this is just routine followup on the Raspail case.
Lecter has already named Buffalo Bill.
Sir doesnt this William Rubin strike you as  I dont know  kind of vague?
Might I suggest tucking your pants into your socks? To prevent mouse intrusion.
Oh my Oh my... Maybe you better come out now Miss Starling.
Jack Gordon.
Yes. I bought the house from her two years ago.
I hope so. They havent posted anything.
Youre qualified and available. And frankly I cant spare a real agent right now.
Its all there sir practically verbatim.
Right down to the kleenex I used.  Sir why? Is something wrong?
Sir thats a field job. Its outside the scope of my assignment. And Ive got a test tomorrow on 
Im here sir I just  I dont know how to feel about it.
Then have the lab check Raspails head.  Dr. Lecters patient  have them probe his softpalette tissues... Theyll find another cocoon.
Hes already offered to help... What would happen if we just showed our cards  asked him for Bill?
Transfer to a new prison. With a view of trees he said or even water... Can we swing that?
But not from this angle. Not thinking he knew her. Youve got to send me
Starling 
Sewing...
They live in Malaysia. In this country theyd have to be specially raised from imported eggs.
Where does Mrs. Lippman live? Id like to talk to her.

He said  I can smell your cunt.
All that detail just from memory...?
Do you know why hes called Buffalo Bill? Tell me. The newspapers wont say.
I didnt.
A census taker once tried to test me. I ate his liver with some fava beans and a nice chianti... Fly back to school little Starling.
Why? Do you know something about him?
That doesnt interest me Doctor. And its the sort of thing Miggs would ask.
Buffalo Bill...?  Bill killed him all those years ago...? Thats impossible.
Was it a butterfly?
Youre very frank Clarice. I think  it would be quite something to know you in private life.
Why so briefly?
How very thoughtful... Or did Crawford send you here for one last wheedle  before youre both booted off the case?
No. We just 
Dr. Lecter when theres time Ill 
And  one morning I just  ran away...
No. First I tried to free them... I opened the gate of their pen  but they wouldnt run. They just stood there confused. They wouldnt run...
Yes...
Toughened your nipples didnt it...?  Six foot one strongly built about 190 pounds. Hair brown eyes pale blue. Hed be about 35 now. He said he lived in Philadelphia but may have lied. Thats really all I can remember Senator  but if I think of any more Ill let you know.
No fair You lured him with produce.
Officer Starling. Welcome back.
The Latin name comes from two rivers in Hell. Your man  he drops these girls into rivers every time. Didnt I read that?
Can we rest soon?
Duncan you are absolutely gallant. If Cora doesnt marry you I shall.
Let us go miss.
Anyone lookin to pick up our trail would see it as a sign of our passing...
Yes. He said... do not try to make them understand you.
Why did they turn back?
In London those radical ideas could land you in Newgate prison.  Why were those people living in this defenseless place...?
Yes. I want you to go.
There was none
He delivered no such message.
Duncan...  Duncan I promised you an answer. You have complimented me with your persistence and patience... But the decision Ive come to is Id rather make the gravest of mistakes than surrender my own judgment.
You are defending him because youve become infatuated with him.
What the bloody hell plan is this?
What are they doing to Duncan? Duncan
He is Huron and nothing else.  Why would he want to murder the girl?
I ought to have you whipped from this fort
You will have to forego the pleasure of hangin me.
 Only one or two loads.
Well see in the morning...
Youre not coming with us?
No.  Huron serve no one. The French father believes he fooled Magua because he is so proud of his cleverness he is blind. But it is the Huron path that Magua walks down not the French one... Now Les Francais also fear Huron. That is good. When the Huron is strong from their fear we will make the terms of trade with Les Francais. And we will trade as the white man trades. Take land from the Abnakes fur from the Osage Sauk  Fox. And make the Huron great. Over other tribes. No less than the whites as strong as the whites.
...not enough time to get to Albany and back with reinforcements...
And what is that?
I know.  One has to give Americans reasons and make agreements to get them to do anything at all.  Tiring isnt it?  But thats the way of it here.
Might I enquire after the situation sir given that Ive seen of the French engineering from the ridge above?
Terrible feature of war in the Americas.  Best to keep your sight fixed on our duty.
And who empowered these provincials to pass judgment upon Englands policies in her own colonies? To come and go without so much as a by your leave.
General Webb can burn in hell. Well go back and dig our graves behind the ramparts Our mission is to fight.
The decision is final.
Does Yengeese Major have property across salt sea?
Many things my French father cannot do Magua can.
And I to make yours Monsieur le Marquis.
Monsieur le Marquis I am a soldier not a diplomat. You called this parlay for a reason.
However I may apprise such testimony from Monsieur Montcalm Fort William Henry is strong and stands.
My master requires the fort be destroyed.  But for you and your comrades there is no privilege that will be denied. None of your men will see the inside of a prison barge. Theyre free to go so long as they return to England and fight no more on this continent and the civilian militia return to their farms.
Carry them to England to your King with pride.
Il est necessaire detre vigilant mon enfant.
Well Ill be on the golf course in the morning.  Then if I dont have any babies to deliver
These observers were doing something. A test...I think they sank that ship on purpose to cover up their mistakes.
But what about those scales... or that leechlike thing that bit Cobb?
Dont worry I dont want to give up any more.
What has?
What dead one on the ship?
Think  Can we stop it? Block it up?  Shut down the line somewhere?  Think
No.
I got hung up  Try this
How do you know it was Williams?
Why cant we pick up his signal?
Good...Its going good.
I need electrical field experience on my resume. Everything helps...  Why are you here?
Yeah...I think theyre just deciding what to do with us.
Seeing how my stocks doing...
How much time does that give us?
Wheres Jones?
Jones...come with me.  Cobb you and Doc check the rooms.
Roger.
Okay.
And it killed Bo?
What you dont understand is that my crew is in jeopardy.
Im not anxious to find out either.
Do it.
I realize you must have gone through hell
Not yet.
Fuck the suits its the people monitoring them.  It Doc had been there like hes supposed to it never wouldve happened
Aw loosen up Bowman...  Hey Willie I got one served up for you.
Hooks on 24...
I aint goddamnit...Its Jones..
Im going to kill it
Oh gag man how can you eat that stuff?...
Were simply concerned about her...proximity to...
Lets hope it holds.
Sixpack...
Sorry darling...Just thought a little humor would loosen us all up...you know?...
Hes a stroppy sod but hes got more balls than a golfer only he doesnt know it.   Cut from completed film.
Stop fucking around Tom and think. What are we going to do?
Well its still a good idea.
Sex and sleaze and antique shotguns are all deep and dear in Harrys stone cold heart.
I would rather put my money on a threelegged rocking horse. The odds are a hundred to one for a good reason BACON . . . it wont win. So where is Ed with all the bright ideas?
And nobody wants to live next door to the people that we live next to a bit antisocial you know.
Ill meet you in the van when you have finished with handsome there.
Apart from those shotguns.
Wherere the others?
Oh you must be the brains then. Thats right guns that fire shot . . . Make sure you bring everything from inside the gun cabinet. There will be a load of guns thats all I want. Ill pay you when you deliver. Everything outside the cabinet you can keep its yours.
Its a fucking stately home of course therell be something there.
Can I help?
No Harry you cant.
It looks like t but who knows? The opportunity was there. In my experience it is best to take the opportunity if it is there.
I wont be seeing you again Chris I have paid him every last penny.
Made a few quid did ya? Now where is it?
Well you had better go and get it from the office. Thats if you want to see your son reach his next birthday. Now chopfuckinchop.
Try that one.
All right Dad.
This is dangerous shit Dean we dont even know who lives in there.
Er well yes we do.
There is no such thing as easy in my experience and if you think this is going to be easy youre a dick. It may be easier than most but its not going to be easy.
Just hold on I got the keys.
OK open the gate.
Well we have got about a hundred thousand pretty pieces of paper with the Queen on it. Will that do?
I dont know but what I do know is that theres no more Harry which means theres no more debt and if theres no more debt theres no more problem and theres no more problem with our neighbours because they are all dead. I think if I get this right we havent done anything wrong anyway which means we are in the clear.
Right as rain.
What do you mean me?
. . . What?
No you need five hundred grand to see me.
Its Ed if thats what you mean.
I wanted to talk to you about that.
I like your bar.
Look could you just open the door so I could talk without shouting?
I got contacts. Listen Tom if you pointed them at me Id shit myself or do whatever you said to do. Either way you still get the desired effect.
Range? I dont want to blow the arse out of this country granted but I dont want anybody blowing a raspberry at me either. I want to look fucking mean.
Thats going on optimism.
When the bottle in my arse has contracted Ill let you know.
Tom the fatter you get the sadder you get.
Just shut up.
Youll find out when I get you home. Thanks Sam.

You didnt marry him for love.
It doesnt ring a bell.  I have to go.
I didnt leave.  I was just digging around.
I wasnt.
I was grateful to him.  I owed him my life.  And he loved me. He couldnt always show it but he felt it.
Dont be.  Nix cant hurt you now.
And they all came...
Harry...
Yeah.  Remember Quaid?
So could you walk on water?
Have you got a job thatll pay you five thousand a day?
You could almost pass for a detective DAmour.  I work for the best illusionist in the world.
Never call him that.  Hes strictly an illusionist.
Youre a detective with no clues. Where else are you going to look? Im going to keep this brief.  Heres thirty thousand dollars.
No.
Havent you seen enough to know that doesnt matter?
Weve got to get you to a hospital.

And hes dead?
Ok youre scheduled to leave Saturday but well hold a seat Thursday in case but first class is full youre waitlisted for an upgrade... there might be a seat on Lufthansa...
25 years... thats a long time... Are you still in love with your wife?
Who do I have to fuck to get off this planet?
Hi. Did you have a nice swim?
Im here for the week.
Hi Charlie.
Ok.
OK see you downstairs.
I see them every morning.
I think he kind of liked me...Is that so hard to imagine?
Yeah you dont remember?
No you smiled.
I know I kind of blend in here.
Ok whatever you want.
No yes it does...
I dont know I think maybe I broke it? I knocked into something the other day...
We should get you to the doctor.
No.
That lunch was the worst huh.
I know. But it doesnt last you have to go back sometime.
Oh?
Hello darling.
Is there anything I can do?
Alright?
Fine.
Hello Bob its me.
Fine. Is it going ok?
Do you want to 
Thats ok.
Mr. Harris we have fax for you
Thank you Mr. Harris.
Excuse me?
Thats ok youll figure it out.
Bye.
Ok have fun there youre so lucky you dont have any kids yet and you can go off to Japan... call me when you get back.
Im just here shooting this band what about you?
Have you met Charlotte? My wife.
Sorry if I have the worst B.O. Ive been sweating in this little room with T.V. lights for hours...
Its probably trivial.
Bad?
Sushi.
I found the pentacle.
And how would you describe him?
On the day of the murders  what did the defendant request?
Tell the jury how many people work in that office with you and Mr. Viznick.
My secretary?
Of course not.  They put him through severe mental stress.  Causing this aneurysm.
I dont have the experience.  Father Thomas should officiate.
Yeah.  It didnt make any sense.
You know I respect that you have such faith James.  I dont understand it but I want you to know that despite our differences I admire you and I always will.
Dont you get it?  They had their 2000 years.  Now its our turn.
I know Maya but youll understand when you see this man.  I really need your strength.
Well in my prayers I realized weve been fooling ourselves and probably... blown this all out of proportion.  God would never allow anything like that to happen.
Kelson hold on a second...
...as a narcissist he couldnt blame himself.  He created the voices after the fact.
I saw you on television yesterday.  You were brilliant.
Do you remember Henry Birdson?  The math professor who won the Salwen Medal then went home and killed his family?
On television you seemed so sure of yourself.  If youre really that confident youd be willing to let someone prove you wrong?
I think you gave me the wrong one.
Youre right.  I mustve made a mistake.
Please the children.
At the exorcism Birdson boasted that Satan is about to take over the body of a man.  You are that man Peter.
What?
I know it is.  Right after my parents died I went to the beach...  I was in the water.  Everything was calm.  And then one of those really big waves hit me.  Hard.  Pulled me straight to the bottom.  I struggled and finally ran out of air.  If it hadnt been for my sister who pulled me out I wouldve drowned. Legally dead for a couple of minutes is what they told me.
Until it happens youre still a human being.
Well see Father Frank in the morning. Theres nothing to be done until then.
You cant back out on me now.  We need to be sure.
We millionaires yet?
No the less mystifying.  Good and evil are only illusions.  There is no such thing as evil with a capital E.  That suggests some third party bad guy pulling all the strings.
As if theres another cause for little voices?  No Sally Viznicks a manipulator hes clever he has what I call malignant narcissism.
Well George Viznick is in the grayest of gray areas in the sanity spectrum. Viznick is not psychotic. Hes simply unable to submit to any higher authority.
Hes looking right at me.
Sure thing.  Look Ive got enough between your preliminary statements and all the witness accounts.  You can go home.  Gimme til morning.  Find out who he is. Until then dont sweat it huh?  Just your random bad cheese trying to hole you.
Where is she now?
Nothing.
Fine you dont like this one which one would you rather wear?
Well thats what you think isnt it? Cause Id rather wear a jersey than an apron...
Sure.  In between all the other things I have to do.
Didnt know I needed a reason to come home.
To that stewardess?
You didnt want my opinion in the first place so why even ask?
What do you want me to tell you Monica to go beat that girl up?  To go have sex with him?  Im not going to do that. Yes I believe thinking of other people is important and yes Id rather bake a pie than shoot a dumb jump shot.  If that makes me too prissy for you too bad.
Child please.  Ever since you were little you thought you were too good for anything I had to say.
Dont tell me you arent ashamed of that because I know.
When I said Quincy could do better I was thinking about you.
But you use potato?
It was the least we could do.  And I love to cook.
You love to pose so much lets see it again.
Sort of.
Dont go starting rumors Jim.  My sons college bound with or without basketball.
Id love for him to get a good education.  Thats it.
Youre just scared.  I know rehab is hard and you have to worry about whether youll be as good as you were but you will be.  I believe in you.  You just have to get back on the court.  Like youd get back on a horse.
Just cause I dont kiss her booty like you...
Howd you get him to say yes?
Just wanted to say good game.
But that was a dumbass pass to Toni. Ten seconds left you run out the clock.
You mean my championship trophy?  My bad.
Just like that?
Sometimes.  But whats the alternative not playing?  You remember big Toni?  She quit last year now shes working at some bookstore.  I mean look at us. They treat us like were Hollywood stars over here.  We just played in the championship game.  It doesnt get much sweeter than this.
Ima be in the NBA.  Youre gonna be my cheerleader.
Shes a ho cause shes sending her coochie through the mail.
I dont.
Im warning you dont tempt me.
Yeah.
Yeah.
He aint Spalding.
None of your business.
Cause I dont just stick my dick in anything.
I know right?
Im telling you Coach wishes she was here instead of me.
I dont have it easy like you alright. Theres no red carpet laid out for me.
Who cares if youre never known as the first girl in the NBA.  Youll get more play behind Quincy McCalls woman anyway.
What?
My court I go first.
I wanted you to.
I know he messed up but that doesnt change what hes been to you.
Yeah sorry about that.  I had this meeting with this guy.
Are you out of your mind?
I never asked you to choose.
I decided to go pro.  And who knows where Ill end up you know?
Damnitt Monica.  This aint about us anymore its about me.
Uh huh.
Yup.
Not for Quincy McCall.
Getting there.
That a nice way of saying I rode the bench?
Nah.  I havent dribbled a ball in four and a half months.  Maybe I miss some of the attention but besides that...
Maybe go back to school.
What?
I dont wanna look fast.  Thanks girl.
I came second to the NBA.  Im not about to come second to this bullshit scouting job.
Im just saying itd be nice if you found time for your family. You should see the tramps coming after Quincy.  If you dont talk to him...
Happy.  And he wont want to see you.
Mom we cant let something like this mess up the family.
Cant should never be in a mans vocabulary.
I dont care about the team.  I care about the school.
I dont wanna hurt your feelings.
Anyway I gotta get to this meeting. Tell your Mom Im gonna be late.
Lets hope I can say the same about you one day.
Okay...
What?
A case like this could hang around for months and Im up for this player relations job with the Clips.  This gets out false or not no onell touch me.
We havent exactly been living the fairy tale life the past few years.  Something like this happens it either brings a family closer or pushes them further apart.  Well just have to see how it plays out.  Im giving her some space couple days...
I messed up okay I know that.  But I aint that kids father.
Your mom was real quick to show you those pictures wasnt she? Well she was nineteen when she got pregnant and dont get me wrong youre the best thing in my life but she knew I wasnt ready for no marriage.
What?
Came by to check on you.
I cant believe youre gonna do this to me the situation Im in I dont  Avi You know what?  Being hit by lighting doesnt matter for getting braces ok? Now Solomon let me just ask you once Please. Please. Dont do this.
Im fuckin hammered Burt.
Shut it.  Shut yer fuckin mouth.
Im here Im listening.
I know  and I cant really explain that but I have a feeling theres something some situation between them like they dont really know each other much or well something like they dont talk much anymore 
Brain and Lung.
Its rough.  Im sorry did she make it?
...I want to....I want so many things Claudia. Maybe we can just talk to straighten our things out....there are so many things that I want to tell you

YOU BURN IN BELL.  You burn in hell and you deserve it  YOU GET THE FUCK OUT.

Yeah...its not...its been on for a bit 
 do you wanna cup?
I dont have a boyfriend.

This is for not a fresh cup a great cup of coffee Claudia 
Whats that stand for?
Im sorry.

Well I dont go out very much.
Ive never found someone really that I think I would like to go out with.

Youre a friend of the family I presume?
I used to be smart but now Im just stupid.
Yes they do they do but Ill make my dreams come true you see?  I will.
Mmm.Hmm.

You seem the sort of person who confuses the two.
FUCK YOU.  I pay you I paid you. I give you a fucking chance and a chance and over and over over you let me down.  I trust you with so much. The keys to my store the codes to my locks the life the blood of my bussiness and return is smashing in seveneleven late ualwaysu late loans  I loaned you money for your kitchen that you never did

This is how you wanna spend the time then go go go  youre gonna be surprised at what a waste it is  The most useless thing in the world is that which is behind me Chapter Three 
Mm. Hm.
An old stomping ground is this the attack portion of the interview I figured this was coming sooner or later  Is the girl coming in for the kill?
Go ahead and waste your time.
 fuck you.
Around here.
Well I guess it doesnt.
Not a problem.
...this close...
What name?  My name?
My mothers name actually. Good question.  Youve done youre research.
Frank was my mothers father.
I wouldnt want that to be misunderstood My enrollment was totally unoffical because I was sadly unable to afford tuition up there.  But there were three wonderful men who were kind enough to let me sit in on their classes and theyre names are Macready Horn and Langtree among others. I was completely independent financially and like I said One Sad Sack A Shit. So what were looking at here is a true rags to riches story and I think thats what most people respond to in Seduce And At The End Of The Day? Hey  it may not even be about picking up chicks and sticking your cock in it  its about finding What You Can Be In This World.  Defining It.  Controling It and saying I will take what is mine.  You just happen to get a blow job out of it then heywhatthefuck whynot?  he.he.he.
Yeah lets...maybe just stand.
Oh yeah.
Mmm.
yeah.
I got a call of a disturbance youre door was open I just wanna see whats goin on 
Maybe you didnt but Im here to find out about a disturbance. Some neighbors called said they heard screaming and a loud crash.
No.
If she asks me any question I want to tell her.  I want to tell her everything Ive done.
I wont.
I got in trouble at school.
Yes. Now. Find her. Shes somewhere in the building 
I was saying...thinking maybe Id get my own quiz show someday Jimmy. Just like you
Its okay Stanley. Its alright.
Im drinking.
Yeah.
Did you ever touch her?
Stay here please dont leave me please please if I said I knew would you stay?
Its alright.
No.  But I probably will get a call back.
Ill get it because Im a good actress Richard.
The money would go to Frank.  The court would put the money in the hands of a relative 
 unless Frank is specifically ommitted as a beneficiary thats what will happen.
Hang up the phone.
 whatwhatwhat maam  I 
Hi. Id like to get an order for delivery.
Thats it.
We need more dog food 
Should be onethirty.
Sure.
Go to bed.
I have money.
I have money to give you.
That is good.
I couldnt tell you.  You had enough to carry.
I wish to discuss your brother.
First they told me he had died at birth.  Then your father admitted he was alive but well cared for in secret.  But the message that told of his death said he had been a prisoner.
Excellent Athos.  You have a keen sense of this man.
There is that of course  but mainly it is because I am so much smarter than everyone else.
Resting hes had a long day. Aramis 
Three days??
So what has changed?
Aramis  the King wishes to see you.
Be quiet you fat fool.  Cant you see Im praying?
Forgiveness?
No not Louis
What use am I?
Come on...
Then let him kill me if all my faith is wrong.
Who?
We will make our own luck tonight... if Phillippe holds up.
Who does?
You are right.  But it is a trap.
Raoul 
Athos my friend
Midnight  Mon dieu  Driving the youngsters hard eh?
I was feeling sorry for myself. Raoul is getting married he proposed today  I love that boy beyond all measure Ive spent everything I own to give him education and opportunity.  Now he has complete happiness and I mope.
I fear I know our King.  I came to try to bring you hope.
I know.
You trust his character more than anyone else does.
I will sit with you.  I cant sleep either.
No  Do not be sorry  Never be sorry  The King cares for nothing and for no one  There are no mistakes when you are King  What you do is right for every person  A King has contempt for everyone
Whose rooms are those?
How did you 
Just... water.
Who came?
And you never knew why?
I decided it this morning.
I am King dArtagnan.  I will change my mind as I wish and I will enjoy my banquet as I wish
It is not Raouls heart alone that concerns me.  It is yours.  I know you find women compliant  especially the poorer ones like Michelle.  But do they love you?  Do you love them?  What about a queen to love?  A son of your own?
There is more to love than he knew or that you know.

It has to be a book the Tooth Fairy would know Lecktor has in his cell.
Book code?

What else did you keep out of the papers?
As long as theyre dead...
ILL come back later. I got messages at the Holiday Inn to collect.
Hes working on the single print index. What time is it?
Were running it through the computers now. So far theres no event or service that doubles back into both families. Plus they were big consumers snowmobiles fishing trips scuba videogames lots of routine medical and dental. Its a haystack.  Whats the other?
The mark? Yes.
Did Price get anywhere with the single prints off the Leeds?
What is it?
...theres three ts and an r in Tattler.
We let Lecktors message run as is and decode it after. Or we pull it work our the code and put ours in next week.
Will Bowman just broke the code. It was a James Beard cook book. You need to know what it says right now.
When Im done.
Changes?
VTR film Polaroid stills what?
There is none Weve run it through the computer a dozen times.
Lets admit we struck out this month. The Gulf Streams standing by. The basic lab stuff is on it.  You Zeller Jimmie Price a photographer. Anywhere he hits we can be there in an hour and fifteen minutes. We get the call we roll. The scenell be very fresh...
Stay in the trees.
Wait for the backup Will?
He asked for Will. He said he might call back tonight. I tried to hold him... Im sorry... He said tell Graham broken mirrors.
He went to the mens room.
Tonic will be fine.
No Dont go back into the house...  Its too nice outside.
Francis? Where are you?
No
My back hurts my skin. Did I get burned? I hope to God Im not burned.
Let me lie down.  Listen I want to call my office. My God Im in a Stryker frame.  My backs broken. Tell me the truth.
Not me.
No.
I have had a great privilege. I have seen with wonder the strength of the Red Dragon. All I wrote about him before was lies from Will Graham. He made me write them. Now I understand.  Will Graham you will learn from my own lips how much you have to dread. Because I was forced to lie he will be more merciful to me than to you.  I will be a testament to the truth now.  About his work. About his becoming.
No.
Well its about goddamn time  I have a note here or two pieces of a note that appears to be from the man who killed those people in Atlanta and....
Its written on toilet tissue.  My dear Dr. Lecktor I wanted to tell you Im delighted that youve taken an interest in me. I know that you alone can understand what Im becoming.  I know you alone understand the reality of the people who die to help me in these things understand that they are only elements undergoing change to fuel the radiance of what I am becoming.  Just as the source of light is burning.  Mr. Graham theres a hole torn and punched out then it says...  I have a complete collection of your press notices.  I think of them as unfair. As unfair as mine. The Tooth Fairy. What could be more inappropriate.  Investigator Graham interests me.  Very purposeful looking. I hope we can correspond.  Theres another piece missing here. Ill read the bottom part.  After I hear back from you I might send you something wet.  Signed Avid Fan.  It has teethmarks pressed in it at the bottom.
Hi Linda. ..
Were looking for Graham. The man the book is supposed to go to is a Mr. Will Graham.
Cut the general crap.
Lets keep it the daytoday stuff.  Hows Kevin?
Yeah. Ah... yellow lets paint it yellow.
Yes. I said this is too good to live...
No.
I have to go back to Birmingham.
No. I have to be in there...  alone. Maybe theres something for me if I know how he feels and thinks.
Mama has all Kevins uncles and aunts coming down from Cheyenne next week and...
Go on to the house...
Yeah...
Yeah but not now... These will all make it... guaranteed.
No. Its just my job to find him.  I was in the hospital after Garrett Jacob Hobbs.
...after a while.
Stuart is fine.
I want you to help me Dr. Lecktor.
I thought you might be curious to find our if youre smarter than the person Im looking for.
You should Will. Gods terrific  He dropped a church roof on thirty four of His worshippers in Texas last Wednesday night. Just as they were groveling to Him and singing a hymn.  Dont you think that felt good?  He wouldnt begrudge you two measly murders.
...commercially prohibited.  Number Twelve shot in liquid Teflon in a copper casing. On impact it all opens up in the target. Expect the recoil. Theyre hot loads.  Body armor?
Tank you veddy much.
And this is a CLASS ACT  Its the guys who did the Mary Tyler Moore and Bob Newhart shows  It takes place in a taxi stand  And youre gonna be the Fonzie
Im not interested.  I want to create my own material.
Hi George
Yeah we can have a garage sale. Hey look I got a floor lamp and a network TV Special for only fifty cents
But George I like to push the boundaries...
Youre BLIND  There is no envelope anymore  It hurts me to say this... but theres only one solution   I dont want you two to ever work together again.
I wanna go back to work and put on a happy show.  The best show anybodys ever seen
So whos gonna pay for it?
You know Tony doesnt have that kind of money.
Youve got good days and bad days.
Eh I dunno... Andy.  Im... thinkin of letting you go...
Look  I dont wanna seem insulting.  But... your act is like amateur hour Singalongs... puppets... playing records...
Sure  Comedy  Make jokes about the traffic.  Do impressions.  Maybe a little blue material...
No  That is NOT an audience  That is PLASTER  An audience is people made of flesh  They  live and breathe  Got it?
But its only for thirty seconds
I mean  uh  the colors in the sky are so vibrant.  I love this time of day.
Hi... am I late?
No thanks.
Hey I love movie theater popcorn... but that doesnt mean I have to sit through On Golden Pond.
Gosh.  Gee Lynne... I was just so impressed with your wrestling moves.
If you want...
They dont know... theyve gotta run more tests.
Then your fathers a wimp.
Oh George this is Bob Zmuda.  Bob and I have been buddies for years.
No  Andy dont do it 
What is this World War Two...?
No offense pal but I just dont think youre built for it.  These he menll kick your ass  Theyre huge
And you say Santa what am I gettin for Christmas?  And he says Cancer
The wrestling... the sexist remarks... the foul language... these things are not becoming of an enlightened individual.  It seems you have no respect for anything.
It is apparently not working.
Eh sure.  Were trying to expand our audience base  and I know the college kids really love Andy Kaufman.
I dont know what yer talkin about. You musta talked to someone else 
I dont know nothin about no Kaufman.  Hes been ridin my coattails smearing my reputation. Been usin my good name to get places.
Yeah  You stay away from that Andy Kaufman if you know whats good for you
Isnt Tony Clifton going on Taxi soon?  Maybe thatll chill him out.
Wow you cant BUY this kind of publicity
And you are?
Were going to kill him.  Do you understand that?  Hes going to die just like the others.
If you have something to say I suggest you say it to Morpheus.
Hear what?
Morpheus will take him when hes ready.
Hes going to pop
I got you.
Go.
Shit  Apoc?
Theyll be able to track it.
Five minutes.  Maybe six.
Hello Neo.  Do you know who this is?
Yes.
What do you know?
Because I dont like the idea that Im not in control of my life.
The Matrix?
Youve never used them before.
What is real?  How do you define real?  If youre talking about your senses what you feel taste smell or see then all youre talking about are electrical signals interpreted by your brain.
A.I.?  You mean artificial intelligence?
I didnt say that it would be easy Neo.  I just said that it would be the truth.
Because... I didnt think I would?
What  what lesson?
She is a true psychic.  She sees beyond the relativity of time.  For her there is no past present or future.  There is only what is.
That I would find the One.
Morpheus I dont know 
Bingo.  Not quite what you were expecting right?  I got to say I love seeing you nonbelievers. Always a pip.  Almost done.  Smell good dont they?
Id ask you to sit down but youre not going to anyway.  And dont worry about the vase.
How did you know...?
Who?
Honestly?  I dont know.
How do you know that name?
Theyre watching you Neo.
Please.  Just listen.  I know why youre here Neo.  I know why you left your family and your friends why you left your home to come to this city.  Youre looking for him.
Its going into replication.
... right as rain.
Nothing.  Just had a little deja vu.
A deju vu is usually a glitch in the Matrix.  It happens when they change something.
We cant leave him
I believe I can bring him back.
It wasnt fast enough.
Im fine.  Come on we have to keep moving.
Guns.  Lots of guns.
Hes alive.
Youre not far from Cypher.
Ill be all right.
Hey  You want good stuff or you want shit?
Anybody wanna have a game?
Take it easy.  I only asked because maybe I could you know let you have a little something.
Giovanino  Where have you been?
Charlie I swear on my mother youre not going to believe this.
All right forget it.  Tony you got anything we can put on his face?
Wouldnt bother me.

But I say to you not to resist the evildoer on the contrary if someone takes thy tunic let him take thy cloak as well...to him who asks of thee give and from him who would borrow of thee do not turn away
Youre not going to use that gun Johnny.
I know.

No...no.  Nooo...its just that I...I...uh... this aint my car.
You could say that.

Nothings going on.  Maybe he doesnt want to be alone.  Hes go ing to be sixtyfive in a minute 
Yeah speak for yourself.

Weve got some things to discuss.
From La Rosette only the greatest pastry chef in America.  This is orange from real Seville oranges.  Lemon on a millefeuille crust a little on the fanciful. And a while nothing like a good old white cake vanilla with Angel food but some maroons shavings thrown in.
Yeah?  And what about my enemies?
Okay.  All aboard  New York New York
No jocks?  A twentygame winner or a Masters champion?  Someone I could talk to.  Or would talk to me.
But what?
Im sorry I dont recall 
You mean this sir?
How would you like that sir?  On some kind of toast?
Hi.

Do you think I need a haircut?
How nice for you both.
For how long?  And why?
Okay well see you tomorrow.
Im just giving you the truth.  There was a time when William Parrish liked the truth.
Bontecou wants a quick response and 
So I am to understand from your re sponse that you do not want to hear the details of Bontecous offer?
Certainly Bill.
You get not to go to jail.
Quince mman thanks for the offer but its all set for just me and Bill. More people might 
Its up to Joe huh?
Can mistah.  Take me to dat nex place.
Make it time.
Doctor?  What could be wrong wit you?
Schoolboy tings is you head. Badness for you badness for her badness for me lyin here tumor big as breadfruit poison my inners an waiting.
Sure.
Are you?
Do you love Drew?
When you put your mouth to his Susan it seems a frequent thing.
Yes?
Goodnight to you Susan.
I think you want to go to the west wing.  Through there.
Then why are you here Joe?
Watch me do what?
Thats impossible.  Im a doctor Im 
Yes.
Not now.
I thought you said Be sorry for nothing.
I dont know.
I dont like the way Drew spoken to you.  But I feel better about it now because of the way you spoke back.
To bed.
It was everything.
I love you in an evening gown.
Its a saying.
Thank you.  Would you like the mans name?
I hope you realize Bill...in your office this morning that was your time.
Feeling?  I feel fine.  How do you feel?
Oh I wouldnt tell them anything Bill.  Youll ruin the good start we had last night.  I felt as if I were being treated like a person.  Joe this and Joe that  a nice smile  Quince passed me the rolls  no rapture or passion or any of those mighty things you seem so intent on imparting but I am cer tain should you  uh  say  uh  who I am  our adventure would end abruptly.
What do you mean?
Of course.
Can you keep a secret?
Im sure youll see to it that it wont be a problem.
I dont want anybody buying up my lifes work and turning it into something it wasnt meant to be.  A man wants to leave something behind. And he wants it left behind the way he made it.  And he wants it to be run the way he run it  with a sense of honor of dedication of truth. Okay?
Fish?
Im sorry to hear that.
May I remind you this is not just a dispute with a putative suitor this is me.  So watch it...Bill.

Thats easy for you to say You cant get scared you dont remember how you fucking idiot
You pathetic piece of shit. I can say whatever the fuck I want and you wont have a clue you fucking retard.
 John G. was clever. He took the dead mans gun and replaced it with the sap that hed hit me with. He left my gun and left the getaway car. He gave the police a complete package. They found a sap with my blood on it in the dead mans hand and they only found my gun. They didnt need to look for anyone else. I was the only guy who disagreed with the facts and I had brain damage. 
Mrs. Jankis the companys position isnt that Sammy is faking anything just that his condition cant be shown 
Thank you.
Leonard you dont have a clue whats going on. You dont even know my name.
Thats who you were you dont know who you are.
John Gammell?
So I see. Its good to see you. My names Teddy.
You dont have to remember to be hungry.
Just for revenge. Thats what keeps me going. Its all I have.
Probably left it in your room.
Shes involved with these drug dealers.
So in your grief you wandered into a Jaguar dealership?
Thats who you were Lenny. You dont know who you are who youve become since the incident. Youre wandering around playing detective... and you dont even know how long ago it was.
Im a snitch. Hes a cop from out of town looking for information. The local boys put us in touch.
Theres a guy in here hurt bad We gotta get him to a doctor
That and your thing.   
You tell everyone about Sammy. Everyone wholl listen. Remember Sammy Jankis remember Sammy Jankis. Great story. Gets better every time you tell it. So you lie to yourself to be happy. Nothing wrong with that  we all do. Who cares if theres a few little things youd rather not remember?
Are you sure?
You cant just take it
Why would I have a gun?
His names James F. Grantz John G. Check    your tattoos. 
Grieve elsewhere.

Paul since you brought her up I have to ask you this or Id be drummed out of the agents union what about a nonfiction book? The truth about what went on in that house.
How do you that.
Oh I am.  Later..
Only because..its spring..chalk it up   to spring fever.
Maybe thats it then.  Everythings upside down and backwards...
To do what?
Not going in from the ground.  Show me the atrium.
You know that was the hardest part of having to portray you.  Grinning like an idiot every fifteen minutes.
Why you going to make me a better offer?
A myth..just a myth...shouldnt you be checking out their countersurveillance?
Right.
How much longer before you can reach him?
He shouldve have killed the virus in the incubation area..Nyahs exited the elevator on the same level as the lab.
No.  Just as if Id like to.
What if I pay the rent?
Think youre the only one who can pick a lock?
Indeed.
At least you walked.
Not really.  I triggered the alarm..
Oh bloody hell.  Youre a spy.
Ethan Hunt.
Not revealing information doesnt necessarily make someone a liar.
Which is?
This doesnt seem to be accomplishing much.
Just like old times.
Just about..
Bids from possible Chimera buyers  to prove that as of the date on the newspaper those bids are back up by earnest money 
Why?  Whats happened. What did you see?
No time to explain.  Youve done well and were so close.  So close.  Its critical that you do whatever Ambrose asks.  Dont worry  itll be over soon.. Thats a promise.. Come on now off you go
Why did you phrase it like that?
Youre sorry and Im sorry.
Dr. Vladimir Nekhorvich is dead.  So is his colleague Gradski but that happened earlier.  We had Nekhorvich on a flight from Sydney that crashed in the Rockies..
You were there.
In any case youve got to recover Chimera and bring it to us.
Well you know Nekhorvichs history. Youre the one who got him out of the Soviet Union was it still in bio weapon business.
Miss Hall and Ambrose had a relationship which he took very seriously.  She walked away and hes wanting her back ever since.  We believe shes our surest and quickest way of location him.
Well then I mislead you.  Or you made the wrong assumption.  Either way were asking her to resume a prior relationship not do anything she hasnt already done.
Youd like me to conduct my own debriefing.
Id thank you  but Im not sure that was a compliment.
In this case it wasnt a bad idea.  In face it was a pretty damn good idea. Just dont make a habit of it.  And as for Ms. Hall in light of her efforts her criminal records will certainly be expunged.  Im assuming you approve.
That simple huh?
Left jacket pocket?
No garage entrance.  Lobbys protected by five guards on rotating patrol.
You know I think its a little late for that.  Do give my regards to Gradski if you see him.
Yes Anatoly yes.
So what do you suggest?
S.O.P..
And if we dont find him  well search the whole train again.
May take a little time.
If youre gonna do this again Claire Its not gonna be on my watch.
I wasnt.  I heard that Jim was in trouble on the radio.  He said someone was...
Take off your coat.
Take off your God damn coat
No one sent me  Were supposed to be back here at four oclock four oclock if we abort we dont return here until four oclock 0four hundred four am four oclock 
Im going to get it for him.  Whoever the mole is I think goes by the name of Job at least part of the time. 1 cant find him but if he knows 1 have the NOC list hell find me.
Sure...
You didnt have to.........
Kittridge is Job.  Max delivered.  How far is he from Luther?
Theyre dead.
One hour.
Yeah.
Of IMF agents.  At the Embassy.  Tonight.
Lets see if you can follow me around this room.  The drunk Russians on the embankment at 7 and 8 oclock...The couple waltzing around me at the Embassy at 9 and 11. The waiter behind Hannah at the top of the staircase  Bowtie 12 oclock. The other IMF team.  Youre worried about me. uWhyu?
I dont know Ethan. Suppose you tell me?
Well my Mother was a little confused about how the DEA could mistake her and Uncle Donald for a couple of dope smugglers in the Florida keys.
That depends.
Whether you like a paradox.  I want a hundred and fifty thousand dollars.
Like Job?
Tell you what.  How goods the RF scanner you used in the car?
I dont have to tell you what a comfort anonymity can be in my profession  like a warm blanket.  My deal with Job was subject to a successful boot scan.  Obviously it didnt pass muster.  Deals off.
It doesnt dear girl.  as long as you tell me where the money is.
Bank?
Were not outta here yet.
Just waiting for you tubs.
Just dont chew it.
Higher.
Jim.  Jim.  Hes in the open.
Jim gave an abort we should walk away.
If Max doesnt like what you have to say youll be wearing that shroud indefinitely.
What the hells made you decide to take your leave at the worst possible time? Claires in a weird mood too.
Ethan you ucantu burn out.
Hes our guy.
Yeah smaller countries dont computerize customs records 
I can sit up straight.  I just cant..sit up straight very well.  Its not important  I saw who shot me.  Ethan I saw the mole.  It was Kittridge.  iKittridgei
We dont have to Jim.  Hell come after us.
What he didnt get in Prague.  The NOC list.
Youre probably right.
And get a doctor.
Keep counting Claire.
Ethan  Ive always taught you nothing can be more dangerous than the truth.  It can kill you.
I dont know.
Doesnt mean its a signal.  Could just be the hard drive heating up.
Twenty minutes.
Connection denied.
Nobody. Loretta is getting married.
Im going to bed now.
Your life is not built on nothing. Ti amo.
Bed.
Again?
I didnt give you away the first time.
Whatd you do to your hair?
Alright. I didnt see you here.
And what did they say?
Let me come and talk to you.
Yes. Do you want...
Excuse me.
He knew my husband who died.
Yesterday.
You got any whiskey? How bout giving me a glass of whiskey?
All my life I have never reached a man. I knew that I would reach my husband but I took my time and he was dead. Ronny.
Ive never seen a moon like that.
Dont just become excited.
What did you do?
Marc Chagall. A Russian.
Thats right.
Good We can get this out on the table.  Im Ronny Johnnys brother. 
No Ill tell him.  What am I going to tell him?
You? No.
No?
My scalp is not getting enough blood sometimes.
I shouldnt.
Bobo take the cart away.
This is a good suit.
My mother is dying. When she is dead Ill come back and well be married.
Not yet. Im waiting till a moment when shes peaceful.
In time you will drop dead and I will come to your funeral in a red dress.
And whos gonna pay for that?
No.
Shes dying. But I could still hear her big mouth.
Not yet. That old lady makes him sweat.  Wheres that card?
Wheres pop?
No more hes not.
She recovered.
You gotta date?
What sins have you to confess?
I will. But I must find the right moment.
I came right from the airport.
Shes not home yet. Take off your coat and come in the living room. Ill make you a drink. I wanna talk to you.
Where is she?
Youre kidding?
You dont know where Loretta is?
Definitely
Im not disturbed. By you.
None of your business.
I think its because they fear death.
Im too old for you.
Sure.
You mean the whole house?
You know in this light and with that expression on your face you look about twentyfive years old.
You were a tiger last night.
And what do you burn apart from witches?
Not at all.  They could be carried.
Well it doesnt matter.   Go and tell your master that Arthur from the Court of Camelot is here.
He knows of a cave ... a cave which no man has entered.
But the Grail ... where is the Grail?
The Britons.
I am your king
The Lady of the Lake her arm clad in the purest shimmering samite held Excalibur aloft from the bosom of the water to signify by Divine Providence ...  that I Arthur was to carry Excalibur ... That is why I am your king                                OLD WOMAN       Is Frank in?  Hed be able to deal with this one.  DENNIS Look  strange women lying on their backs in ponds handing out swords ... thats no basis for a system of government.  Supreme executive power derives from a mandate from the masses not from some farcical aquatic ceremony.
We want ... a shrubbery
We are now no longer the Knights Who Say Ni
Oh please
Had enough?
Course I have.
Youll what ... ?
Come Patsy.
Im French.  Why do think I have this outrageous accent you silly king.
I am Arthur King of the Britons.
This new learning amazes me Sir Bedevere.  Explain again how sheeps bladders may be employed to prevent earthquakes.
Er ... We ... Launcelot Galahad and I ... Er ...  leap out of the rabbit and ...
No  Not the Knights Who Say Ni
Just keep me covered.
Its the ... oh ...  its the ... its on the tip of my tongue ...
Yes my liege.  Stand by for attack
Oh just some friends
There are some who call me Tim?
Greetings King Arthur.
How shall we find this cave O Tim?
Who did we lose?
Man
Im thirtyseven.
Well ... I AM king.
Yes I see.
Be quiet  I order you to shut up.
Shut up
Well dont.       I really dont know where all this got started. Its like those miserable psalms.  theyre so depressing. Now knock it of
If she ... weighs the same as a duck ... shes made of wood.
My name is Sir Launcelot.
What is your quest?
What is the capital of Assyria?
I think I could pull through sir.
Farewell Concorde
You even kicked the bride in the chest  Its going to cost me a fortune
Is it?
But Mother ...
Shut your noise you  and get that suit on
Well ... Ill tell you ...
... and youll come and get him.
No ....  keep him in here ... and make sure he doesnt ...
What?
Oh yes of course  I thought you meant him  You know it seemed a bit daft me havin to guard him when hes a guard ...
Yes.  Its not a very good name is it?  But we are nice and we shall attend to your every ... every need
Camelot ...
Why?
No really I can cope.  I can handle this lot easily
I dont think I was.
No no we must find the Grail.
You got my note
I knew that someone would come.  I knew ... somewhere out there ... there must be ...
No no no.
Not down south you dont.
Its better than shovelling horse shit.
Three years John.  Is that not a bit long to be grieving?
You know what I mean.
The goodlooking one.
Ive got my duties to attend to.
Oh Im much more than that.
Mary Taylor sir.
I hope to go up next year.
Mr Brown sir 
Yeah yeah I did.
Yeah.
A situation?
I do believe they send so many boxes to taunt me. Doctor Jenner writes to them to say that my nerves are in an extremely fragile state and yet they continue to hound me with box after box after box after box after box
Browns responsibilities are onerous enough already.  He has far too much to do without having to stay up all night waiting for you to go to bed. The smokingroom will be closed and the lights put out at twelve oclock.
And that is my last word on the matter.
How will I know?
Thats not good enough.
You will await your orders like everyone else.  Unless you prefer a repeat of yesterdays little excitement.
Shell need to sign dispatches before she retires.
I dont doubt that the Queen was highly amused.  She has always had a very healthy sense of humor.
I recommend Her Majesty uses the covered carriage with a full Horse Guard.  In the event of any disturbance I will ensure 
I am a blank sheet.
Quite.
Ive been called back to London.  My last day.  I thought I might take a walk on Lochnagar.
Its nothing.
Im not married.
I do what I do.
Yes maam.
I hope they didnt go to any trouble John.
I heard something.
Aye.  But there are Fenians reported on the mainland.
Ill decide when its exaggerated.
Yes?
Im breaking no promises
For gods sake woman Im just trying to keep you safe
Then why send me back to them?
Not at all Dean.  Good of you to spare the time.
You cant know that for sure.
Who?
Of course.
Some young page was boasting about having seen it.  Lucky.
No indeed.
Whom?
Cold is good
Why am I being lectured in this way?
I will not tolerate anybody lecturing me about the responsibility of the monarchy....
I understand he was in a fight.
No.  I shall be out walking.
I have no idea.
I  forgive me maam I am no wiser than yourself.
Please tell the Princess and other signatories to this letter that the Queen will not be dictated to or made to alter in any way what she has found to answer for her comfort.  Do I make myself clear?
Prince Albert is at Windsor maam.
You ordered all members of the Royal Family to attend you at Balmoral.
Well technically yes but this is only the prototype.
How do you do that?
What the hell are you talking about?
Greg never came home.  A few hours is one thing Nick but this is different. Somethings happened to him.
It doesnt necessarily mean shes...
My house.  I want to try something.
Nick what is it.
...but then it hits the relay stations...
No Im not...
I cant believe you made it
Screamer.
I am The Liar.  Where should I take you?
Give her a chance will you?
Im going home.
Im going home Cynthia.
Im going home. Ill call you later.
There is no problem.
I agree with what you said...truly.
Im sorry Mr. Kesher but there seems to be some problem concerning your credit card.
Thats fine Mr. Kesher. You can pay cash when you check out. Im sorry. it was my duty to inform you.
Now I guess you and your Aunt have an understanding. So heres the key and you need anything just give a holler.  Everybody in this buildings pretty much okay with me or they wouldnt be here. If you want later Ill introduce you around. No hard feelings if you dont and dont forget the rooftop garden. Its just up the stairs we passed. Its open to all the tenants. You can see the Hollywood sign from there.
Its just for a night or two until she finds her own place. I tried to explain that to Aunt Ruth but the connection was bad and her plane was leaving and she got it all mixed up. I kept telling her it was my friend and she kept saying she didnt know any Ritas ...
Well then take a seat everyone. Betty why dont you join Jimmy and well play the scene. Is there anything youd like to say Bob... something to Betty before they begin?
No. I cant.
Oh...
But this could be serious.
Maybe the voice isnt Diane Selwyn. Maybe thats your roommate or if it is Diane Selwyn she can tell you who you are.
Good luck
What is it? What do you see?
Do you know them?
Keep going. Go around to the back.
It sounds kind of nice ... being somebody brand new.
And who are we auditioning for today?
And do we know which of the fiftyseven buildings Wally Brown is in?
Well now weve got to figure that out first dont we?
Mr.Wallace Brown is in the Executive Building on the second floor. We want to go in and turn right at the first street. Then we want to walk three blocks down past Stage 17 to the white Executive Building. Once were on the second floor the receptionist will take us from there. Now do we have name?
Gotta keep an eye on her thats all.
I just wanted to come here.
This Dennys.
Okay so you had a dream about this place. Tell me.
Find out who they are?
Where at?
Damn thats a long drive.
Making ends meet huh.
Yeah look at my digs ... times are tough.
Not a coke or anything?
Great.. great. Is there any kind of hint or anything ?
Whats going on ?
No time. Get him up.
Leave him hes dead.
Knows ? He watches every Guest on tape. This whole place is here for his sick amusement. And no so are we.
Once the room depletes its oxygen we have about 30 seconds then a door opens on the bottom over there. Then we swim out.
So you may have been duped this whole time. Killing innocent people that must make you feel ... how does it feel ?
Yeah everyone has to when they get hired.
You dont. Its random there no trick.
Its poison gas this is the antidote. Drink it.
Itll end. Itll end with him and McCay. Then the park shuts down. Permanently.
I work here remember ?
43 unpaid parking tickets sir.
I dont help criminals.
Lets just see if he can make it into round two....
Yes sir Mom. 
Youve got it boss. One more mangled body to the East River coming up 
Here. Am I ever going to get to run the controls for one these capers ?
Look youre going to have to start trusting me sometime. I am a trustworthy person.
Thats right. Now who needs to trust who ? Trust me when youre ready to work the controls Ill put you in the hot seat.
Matthew lives on the Upper West Side kinda posh for a temp dont you think ?
Checking........
Not that well sir. I believe we have a few too many soft hearts in the building. Did we aquire a bank from Chicago or a charity ?
I am thirty two.
Bruce may still refuse. It is my belief that he is becoming more belligerent.
What then sir ? What would we do with the park with out Bruce ?
John sir.
Fantastic  A little faster sweetheart.
What are you looking for ? A blow job ?
Then what do you want ?
What ?????
I dont know.....

Go in there ? What if Bruce finds you ?
Thank you.
Yes.
Yes Excuse me for a second.

No its okay I understand really.
Hey why dont you just keep your room and well put the baby in the back yard.

Hungarian. Famous for their beautiful music...and beautiful women.
This is one of my favorite things her passport.
No. You know they say that it never rains that you can barbecue on Christmas day...instead of riding your bike you just surf over to your friends house. Oh and the place is just crawling with celebrities. I know someone who saw Walter Matthau picking up his drycleaning.

Eater  says she doesnt see how you do it.

You get her those Vitamin E right away.
Okay. Thanks.
Barnett John Triplette. Hows she doing?
Haven? Hell weve been playing poker together since we were fourteen.
He knows better.
They can come to the concert in the park.
Absolutely. Listen Barnett I understand your position.
Nothing Barnett. Its my job.
Who the hell is he?
What does he want?
I dont care. Shes always been neutral in politics and thats not going to change.
Oh no listen I dont want to take up too much of your time.

Im in a hurry gonna see this great group record at Woodland.

Nash.
How are you going to pay when you get sick?
He doesn1t have fungus does he?
Ive been a Little dyspeptic.
When I was little in church.

Yea.
Im sorry but I have to go.
Eightthirty in the chapel.
Hundreds of times.
Thanks. You are just a wonderful person.
Youre doing some recording here arent you?
Mary?
Do they have a show to give it to you?
Do you study at all?
Where is she?
Were connected by a relative. One time one of his aunts married one of my uncles. That was a long time ago though. Howd you come to work for him?
I never heard of him. Name somebody else.
Ill be damned. Boy if you could get Ryan to say something about Hal Phillip Walker wouldnt that be something?
Ill be dammed.
Sure thing.
More or less...
Yes you are.
Tim studied several styles but his favorite was Jeet Kune Do.
What...
How do you intend to disappear? youre probably the most famous couple in America.
Are we in a big hurry?
Well since that time theyve killed one person during their trail. And since their incarceration theyve killed one psychologist along with several guards and inmates.
Whats changed Mr. Gayle is our minds. We felt they were competent a year ago. A year has passed sir a year where they were under close observation day in and day out and their behaviour has led us to believe we were wrong.
Now that you bring it up yes. They were different men. I hadnt really thought that much about it. Since many psychiatric opinions are by a rule sought out for this kind of situation. What do you think normally happens? The Knoxs are assigned a family psychologist that takes care of them throughout the rest of their lives? The state doesnt work like that.
Mickeys better half herself. Mallory Knox. This little lady drowned her father in a fish tank.
Tough titty its mine now.
Good...yuppie piece of shit.
Have you talked to Mallory about this?
Dont worry about it.
No Mickey I cant let you get away with that shit. Answer the question. Was it worth it? You havent seen heard or smelled Mallory in a year. Was it worth it?
Excuse me did you say an instant of purity? What was the instant of purity? The bodies you left behind on your bloody trail?
Youll never understand. Me and you Wayne were not even the same species. I used to be you...then I evolved. From where youre standing youre a man. From where Im standing youre a ape. Im here...Im right here... and you...youre somewhere else man. You say why? I say why not?
Its not that easy Wayne. Donuts and a smoke only get you so far. Youre gonna have to do your job.
Describe Mallory? Okay. Shes pretty shes got blonde hair two eyes two feet two hands ten fingers...
No.
Probably not but were gonna give it the old college try.
Are you kidding? The Golden Globe The Edward R. Murrow award...
Yes.
No fuckin way No fuckin way
No fuckin way
Then youve seen the scene where Arnold Schwartzenegger is talking to Lou Ferigno.
Unfortunately yes.
Yes.
Survival of the fittest.
Captn
That dumbass probably put my chocolate cream filled in there by mistake.
So youre giving a man who butchers whole families little babies included my chocolate cream filled?
Me neither. I dont eat meat.
Perfecto
Super cool.  This is great stuff. How ya doin?
Everythings coming along just fine. Phil I wanted to know if I could have a small word with you.
Oh yes indeed. Top flight.
They got a asshole over here.  A asshole sitting down reading a magazine over there.  A asshole perched up there.  Assholes everywhere. Hey maybe if we were doin that kiss kiss bang bang stuff wed need all those assholes too. What were about is intimacy. Were about two people having a conversation. Say I was interviewing you. All I want you to worry about is what I ask you. I want a trust to develop. If youre thinking about all this...  ...youre not going to relax a trust wont develop well be talking a each other instead of to each other there will be no chance for intimacy.
Lose em.
Mr. Wurlitzer I assure you I am very familiar with Mickey Knoxs career.
One...I can take care of myself. I grew up in a tough neighbourhood and Ive handled some pretty rough customers in my day. Mickey Knox doesnt scare me. Two...Im a journalist and Im prepared to take that risk. Three...it aint gonna happen. Believe me when I tell you it is in Mickey Knoxs own best interest to play this game according to Hoyle.  Wait a minute. Weve gotten into a advisory relationship here which is not what I want.  But seriously Phil look at this.
Why dont I have Mickey thrown back into his cell and we can forget the whole thing?
Dont call my men assholes.
They pay you three bucks a day an all the cotton you can eat.

Thatll be thirtyeight cents.

Whenever hes got an edge on.
Nothing you can do. Been like this for days.
Thats right.
Okay.

Just give him a couple of months. A girl like that she dont know any tricks.
Is that right?  Think youre gonna make it with her?
Hi.
Nothin.  Shes all right. Wouldnt have made it without her. Christ  havent worked in eight months. Right now Im waitin for some insurance money. And man when I get it I got plans to make me some more.  Lets get outa here. This place gives me the willies.  You got some money?
Whats the matter? Its a celebration
Your mother used to lay for her boss boy. Did you know that?

He wants to kill you you know... Perhaps I wont allow it.
Of course...
The Elders mon...
A place to tap in. I can scramble that signal before this place is crawling with guardsmen.
Theyre only guessing but we cant take any risks.
Hows the villas security?
You sonofabitch youre crazy.
Put the SenseNet Police on it. The matrix is their turf.
First lets get something straight. We ran a psych construct on you that lists self destruction as your favourite pastime. If you want to kill yourself Mr. Case theres much more entertaining ways than working for me.
Questions make me nervous. Part of our arrangement will be that you dont ask too many.
The disturbance in cyberspace... Its an A.I.
This ones different. No one can trace it. Its out there somewhere in the matrix and its growing stronger... infecting other computer systems like a virus.
It hasnt yet.
Ive arranged for him to work with us.
I know.  You ever work with ghosts Case?
Youll be ready for a trial run in two days. If your splices hold youll use McCoy to trace the A.I.s coordinates.
What about McCoy?
Offworld. The A.I.... this Wintermute thing evolved on a computer mainframe on the satellite Freeside. If you attack it from within the matrix while Molly accesses its original programming we can cripple its defence systems.
Youll be linked during the entire operation.
This aint Bangkok chief.
The words?
I dont have a girl.
Thats a good question. Whats the last thing you remember?
Dixie you know how a ROM construct works?
Okay Dix. You are a ROM construct.
I an I man. I an I.
Can you walk?
No problem amigo.
When were done erase this friggin tape.
Thats pretty good cause hes only working with one lobe.
So it does business through a brain dead marine and runs the stock market for funding. That means Wintermute hired us to fry itself. It doesnt make sense.
No. Its gotta be more than that. That hard wiring also keeps it from getting too smart. Too powerful.
Ill let it access me. Thatll give you a free shot. Make it a good one. Dix.
Dont worry Dix. Im on a roll.
No... No...
People are talking. They say the Yakuza has a contract out on you.
Too many places. Youre playing tag wish some kind of death wish Case.  Im sorry but Im not sticking around for the funeral.
I dont know. I dont know...
Im gonna burn you to the ground you son of a bitch.
Shut down your ice patterns. Ill take you out.
Whats my end?
For someone else. Bodyguard. Courier... Whatever.
Too late?
Put the gun down Case.
Yeah... Yeah Im fine.
Something exotic I hope.
No. Its important to be able to feel those things.  Were going to pull this run off Molly and weve got to do it soon.
Im Josie. Aldys is an interesting name.
Try being named after a guitar playing pussycat.
Nice.
Oh I know.
HeyI went to Northwestern  Once. To use the bathroom.
Thanks.
Yeah I know.
Exactly.
Right. 730.
Nope.
I swear to God Jos. When is the last time you went on a real live date?
And Gus  when you picked up knitting who showed you how to hold the needles?
Yeah but Im okay. Ive got some work to do.
No thanksIm doing this on my own.
Its great Theyre behind you. They feel like they know you.
We used it for our expose on overweight flight attendantsIs That Why They Never Give You a Second Bag of Nuts?
Can I just sayI totally love Ex Lax.
Yeah its French. Theres no accent aigue so the e is soft.
Betty.
It is hoped that its not a mess. Hopefully is an adverb. It means with hope. You have it defining the copy and Im pretty sure the copy doesnt have feelings.
Five Six
Geller you dont want a reporters life. Theyre verymessy. Youre all about order. Control. And getting me my copy by five.
Youre a sick puppy Geller.
Oh. Right.
Kristen got a quote?
No its the Great and Powerful Oz. Now listenyoure in over your head. This is how its gonna work. I review the tapes I find your story.
Youre crazy. I cantI cantno. No.
Dude you rock
You know what?  Why dont you just pick me up here? We could all share a limo.
Wow. Thats big. I mean sex is a really big deal. You shouldnt do it until you know youve found the right person.
Im not going to college Jos. And Im not playing anymore baseball. This is my life.
Gus insists that I become friends with these kids. The popular kids. Its impossible.
No. Josie this is real.
With the reading comprehension of a fifteen year old Plus Im popular... You want to be popular... I can recognize a cry for help when I see one.
Really?
Not the happiest of souls.  Art is a form of catharsis and love is a permanent flop.
College. Havent really thought about it.
Oh no no no no no. See my family we dont go to college.  We just go right into sheep herding.
Im gonna tell you something here and I hope it doesnt undermine my position as an authority figure. Im a little afraid of heights.
You remember that story?
Why do you do that?
I shouldnt say that because Im your teacher.
Thats really what we all need right? Someone to sit up on the wall with us
What ButI wasnt even going to go to college
Its weird because prom is actually from the word promenade. And you cant really promenade alone can you?
Yeah I have.
You were attracted to me?
Wait I was going to tell you
I finally found my story.
The poem I knew he liked the poem  Billy Prince is asking me to the prom.
Relax Monty. Its just my sister.

Rob I mean it. I want you to be my first. Me and you. Once the floor stops spinning lets have sex.
Everybody knows about
And heavy...

He stayed a long time.

i                       Its a bat.               Will it bend?  Its a rat.               Will it break?  Perhaps its the head that I found in the lake.i
i                      Youre so stupid think now  If we blow him up to smithereens We may lose some pieces and then Jack will beat us black and green.i
Its getting there.
Oh come on Dad...
What are you talking about?
What about it?
Shes a neighbor I drive her to school.
You got a problem with me Grady?
Yeah why?
What the hell are you talking about?
It was okay.
Yeah well Schneiders got a stick up his ass today.
He mustve been working late and some fruitcake came in and sliced him up like a kielbasa.  In the shower  Left bloody footprints all over the...
Look at this car.  Are you kidding?
Who Grady?  Gradys alright hes just a hothead.
Yeah.
Wow...
I dont know.  Where are we going?
Whats this?
My Dad thinks Im on drugs my Mom thinks Im crazy and Im not sure I dont agree with her.
Why wont you talk to me?
I cant
Sure...go ahead.
Howd you sleep honey okay?
All of them.
Were going to bed.
Hi Mom.
Its okay Im not tired.  Really.
Theyre healing up nicely.
Research.
No shes right.
When I was a little girl.  Three or four. If I had a nightmare Id bring my Dad in. The dream would always get better.  He always used to tell me about it the next day  he used to think they were his dreams. NANCY When did it stop?
I was on the team at school.  I was never very good though.
You did it the other night.
Those are ancient history.
Fuck off.
Just something children sing...to keep the boogeyman away.
Sounds like a rough time.
Ive been to Pittsburgh.  Does that count?
Thats a new one.  Is that what theyre teaching now at Stanford?
With Hypnocyl?
Everybody take five.
Anything?
All right.  Whoever she is Ill admit she seems to know more about Krueger than I do.
Just go.  Kristen needs you.  Keep her awake somehow.  Do it.
Freddy Krueger.  He was a child murderer before he died.  After he died he became ...something worse.  Six years ago Freddy killed my friends. He almost killed me.  I thought I got rid of him  but I guess he was too strong.
That girl was Amanda Krueger.  Her child 
You must find the remains...and bury them in hallowed ground.
Dont worry it wont come to that.
Elizabeth we dont need any outside help.  I know these kids.  I dont want some hotshot taking chances with them just so she can get published.
There will be no repeat occurences of last nights events.  From now on your doors will be locked during sleeping hours.  Well begin a policy of evening sedation.  For everybody.
For Gods sake Elizabeth...just try to help the kids will you?  Listen to them.
Uh fourteen.
Hi.  Good Lord  youre the spitting image of...
Oh its just down the corridor on the right.
Im a vegetarian.
Night night Honey.
Who was that rather difficult chap you were talking to on the way up?
Fifteen million dollars.
Eighteen yards.  Thats my house there.
No thanks.
Youre welcome and may I also say... heavenly.
Oh  Okay.
Ahm  well  we would have liked to  but it was difficult obviously being set in space.
Yes.
Youll be my date at my little sisters birthday party?
Im sure its all right.  My friend Max is cooking and hes acknowledged to be the worst cook in the world but you know you could hide the food in your handbag or something.
Its the hair  Its to do with the hair.
She left me.
There seem to be lots of reasons why I shouldnt.
Because my boyfriend who I thought was in America is in fact in the next room.
Dont think about it.  Well sort it out.  Now what would you like  tea ... bath...?
Well theres a question  without an interesting answer.
Oh no no  no.
I appreciate that absolutely.  Is that the film youre doing?
My sons name is Johnny?
Well get a message through to him too.
No.  Whats that?
You have a stunt bottom?
Dont ask.
I know I know  but... just  lets stay calm...
I dont want a goddamn cup of tea.  I want to go home.
Thats not true.  And wait a minute... this is crazy behavior.  Cant we just laugh about this?  Seriously  in the huge sweep of things this stuff doesnt matter.
I only found out you were here yesterday.
Thank you.  Shall I...
Whats the thing?
And what would you say...
Thats very good news.  The readers of Horse and Hound will be absolutely delighted.
Yes.
Cest la vie... Were lucky in lots of ways but... Surely its worth a brownie.
Oh no  this is just getting worse. I am going to find myself 30 years from now still on this couch.
Tony  what do you think?
No  its my 22nd.
Di Caprio.
Well yes.  Groovy.
William has just turned down Anna Scott.
Well thanks thats great.
Good move when all is said and done shes nothing special.  I saw her taking her pants off and I definitely glimpsed some cellulite down there.
Oh great.  Could you do me a favour and try to get us some really cold water up here?
Still not sparkling.
Unless its illegal in the UK to serve liquids below room temperature I dont want you going to jail just to satisfy my whims...
And maybe you could just adios the dishes and empty the trash.
Im sorry.  I didnt get down what magazines youre from.
Ah... yes enormously.
But Ringo Starr doesnt look anything like Topol.
Can I help you?
Okay.  Tell me would I have to pay a wet rag as much as I pay you?
Can you tell her Ill ring her back.
No  did you?
Shes perfect perfect.
Is it someone we know?
But I wish to make it clear Ive turned a corner and henceforward intend to be impressively happy.
Im sorry we dont have anyone of that name here sir.
Thanks.  Great.  Wish me luck.
Ahm  combination of factors really. No clean clothes...
Two?  Thats it?
Absolutely not.
Does Flintstone mean anything to you?
Right.  Right.  You think its the wrong moment.  Fair enough.  Do you mind if I have a go?
Okay  okay.  Might be too late but okay.
Right  lets talk about rent...
Yes thats perfectly correct.
Yes that is correct.
I mean the other day you made an allusion to my wife and the possible sexual problems we might be having. I know that to be the case but the way in which you broached it if thats your idea of teaching me something...
Yyyyes...
III...
You should have thought about that before you brought that woman in here
Who? Tell me
Mister McMurphy there are old men here who couldnt hear the music at all if it were lower. That music is all they have and I wish you wouldnt lean against the glass there your hands are staining the window.

Dont you sweet talk me you ol spook you
No she wasnt my sister.
I I mustve misplaced it.
Mr. Bradley left about a half hour ago.  He said his plans had changed unexpectedly.  Would you prefer an interior or exterior room?
Im very sorry.  Perhaps you misunderstood?
Once they pay the bill we dont usually follow them.
Why?
My friend has lost her fucking mind...
Really.  She thinks hes here. Even though shes never met him. Even though shes never laid eyes on him.
No.
It just happened.  I didnt plan it.  I was alone.  And he was... there.  But now everythings changed.  I owe it to him to let him know.  I need to tell him.
Exactly.
Except possibly that.
No.
But Faith
Dwayne Pinsley?  Im trying to reach Dwayne Pinsley.
Im at the airport.  Why?
Well hed have to hurry.  My flight leaves at four oclock.
I know Im limping.  I stubbed my toe.
NO.
Hes safe.
Because Id like to think at least one of you feels that way.  Does he  know who you are?
Because.  I know where he is.
Because I want you to be happy.
Mickey Spillane?
Just to that place down at the bottom of the stairs.  Nothing fancy.
Thank you Peter.  Thank you so much.
Exactly.  Besides no hard feelings.  You found somebody.  I found somebody. I thought we could double.
No.  I just came by to apologize.
In that case... no...
Youre the reason I never met him. You knew it was the thing I most wanted in life and you sabotaged it.
Thats not the point.  And what if I had wanted to?
There is no us.
Tonight?
A few times.  Its kind of an annual tradi
Yeah.  Hes around somewhere.
Youre an accountant for cryin out loud.
Its a metaphor.  Its women who always think theres some unknown out there thats going to be better than whats in front of them.  And instead wind up with nothing.
So?...
Look how big it makes me look.  I look like an Alp.
Its a coincidence.
What about your job?
Youre coming with me?
Sure.  Im fine.  I dont know why I never did this before.  I mean whats the big deal?
Gritty?  Is this gonna be one of those youth hostel dives jammed with backpackers who dont believe in deodorant?
You and the other 99 of the women in the world.
Faith Ive seen it already okay? If I spot somebody whos got a head thats an eighth of an inch around standing underneath a tuba Ill recognize him from the photo. Otherwise Im telling you its not gonna do me any good.
Only what?
What was I gonna do?  Tell him the truth?
Nothing.
Her brother.
I told you.  If he sees me here with another guy hes gonna think Im here with another guy.  I just dont want to send any confusing signals.
Because Im the one whos single.
Packing.
Because Ive been kidding myself. Because I realized you were right from the beginning.  This whole thing was just a wild goose chase.
I know but...
Hes down in someplace called Positano.  Peter says we can make it there by morning.
Or maybe itll turn him back into a toad.
No.  Well I dont know.  Well maybe.  Later.
What do the years matter?  Ive known you for centuries...
I thank you.
Right.
You used to love it when I called you doll.
If I talk too loud its the fault of the nuns.
Gimme.
Very simple. Just bring him to... that place we been using. Mac you take care of the details. Call Gerry G. in if you think you need him.
That was the idea.
He probably gave em an argument.
Why me Charley? Id feel funny going in there.
Ive got to cover a bet there on the way over. Anyway it gives us a chance to talk.
You know the boys are getting rather interested in your future.
Sure thats all right when youre a kid but youll be pushing thirty pretty soon slugger. Its time you got some ambition.
Maybe.
Dont say that
What do you weigh these days slugger?
Gee when you tipped one seventyfive you were beautiful. You shouldve been another Billy Conn. That skunk I got to manage you brought you along too fast.
I tried to keep you in good with Johnny.
Okay Ill tell him I couldnt bring you in. Ten to one they wont believe it but go ahead blow. Jump out quick and keep going... and God help you from here on in.
I wish I knew Edie But 
Thanks.  Steel pipes and baseball bats.
A teacher Dong  You know I admire brains. Take my brother Charley. Hes very brainy. Very.
Well he played it smart. Too many goodfornothins around here. All they got on their minds a little beer a little pool a little  I better get you home.
In a saloon?
I am?
I went pretty good for a while didnt I Al? But I didnt stay in shape and  I had to take a few dives.
Want to hear my philosophy? Do it to him before he does it to you.
Well nobody I guess. But that Father Barry I didnt like the way he kept lookin at me.
Youve been off in daisyland honey. Everybodys got a racket.
I know... I know... .
Lucky Pop isnt home hed kill you.
Get away from me.
I didnt say I didnt love you. I said stay away from me.
Im looking for Charley. I heard Charley was waiting for me.  Charley?
Dont hang on to me. And dont follow me. Dont follow me.  Call the Father. Ask him to take care of Charley for me. My brother. Theres something I got to do.
You heard what Johnny said. No part of the Waterfrontll be safe for you now. Maybe inland the Middle West somewhere a job on a farm... .
You always said I was a bum. Well  not anymore. Im going down to the dock. Dont worry Im not going to shoot anybody. Im just going to get my rights.  Joeys jacket. Its time I start wearing it.
He tries to act tough but theres a look in his eyes that... .
He wanted to see me again.
And learn about charity and justice and all the other things people would rather talk about than practice? Pop goes up to her and holds out his two arms his right one closer to Edie he trembles with emotion.
Someone else cn take your confession.
I dont want to hear it in there.
A question of who rides who.
Good luck.
Why dont you go and chase yourself?
A bum. Look what youre doing. You want to be brave? Firing lead into another mans flesh isnt brave. Any bum who picks up a .45 in a pawn shop can be that brave. You want to hurt Johnny Friendly? You want to fix him for what he did to Charley and a dozen men who were better than Charley? Dont fight him like a hoodlum down here in the jungle. Thats just what he wants. Hell hit you in the head and plead selfdefense. Fight him tomorrow in the courtroom with the truth as you know it  Truth is the gun Drop that thing and tell the truth a more dangerous weapon than this little   cap pistol.
Have a seat. Im trying to find out just what happened to Joey Doyle. Maybe you can help.
Yeah considerin they was usin my head for a baseball
Are you on the level Father?
If I stick my neck out and they chopped it off would that be the end of it? Or are you ready to go all the way?
Down to the wire?
Well I had my fun Ive drunk my fill and I tickled some goodlookin fillies Im on borried time.
Wilson yeah  yeah I fought Wilson.
If I licked him I would have had the title shot instead of him boy I was ready that night.
Raise a hand to me and... .
Yeah once theyre mated they stay together all their lives until one of em dies.
Yeah Im kidding Im kidding. You dont think I should turn him in... .
First things first.
Easy that new checker faked the receipt. Here it is boss. 
By way of Chicago?
It was a big nothing The Father did all the talking.
I can look at her cant I? Its a free country.
I cant believe it a small fortune.   You cant buy me youre still a bum  Bye Edie. Lord have mercy on Joey. 
What are you down here for to see we dont make off with any of Mister Friendlys precious cargo?
Fiend is it  You will not be so fortunate.  Your existence will cease within moments.  No one wishes to see a man dance...  And you my dear will entertain for centuries to come.
..Oh You could do nothing  I can save you much pain.
You wouldnt understand.  Seeing a cemetery on a night like this can stir in the mind the best ideas for a good horror story.
Okay.
I cant imagine anything dead playing that music.
Im not sure myself. Its just a feeling Ive had since the crash...Like I feel a cold chill all over.. ..Now this
I dont know.  I just dont know. But dont give up. Were not finished yet.
Be careful
Im frightened.  Im so frightened.

Faye Dunaway.
Peter Finch.
Why?  You think he might tell you where I am?
Hes dead.  He did twentyseven years before he came out and died not too long after in Charity Hospital I think trying to make up for all the good times hed missed.  Thats not gonna be me.
Those guys bother you?
Well Id say who I was and do you remember me and ask if youd like to meet for a drink.
Yeah but in a nice way.
You believe that?
Dont talk like that okay?  You scare me.
I dont know about that.  You cant do three falls and think you have much of a brain.
I guess the bright glare out here made it hard to see the numbers on the weights.
I see better with them on.
Youre in civilization now man ease up.
You know who they are?
I dont know.  I never used a gun.
Youre the one with balls Dick say something like that to someone like Glenn.  Or maybe you just forgot where you were for a minute.
Of course not.
What kinda man lets a woman answer the door this time a night?
A minute or two youre gonna wish you were.
I prefer to call it an exodus from an undesirable place.
Yeah.  That was the ninth.
Hejira.
Jesus whatd you crawl through a sewer?
Glenn?
Were not.  Im helping him yeah
I dont know he doesnt exactly confide in me.
Oh Im here all right.  Im very here. Question is why arent uyouu here?
Sure right they see Bigfoot driving around a black guy wearing shades and a lavender fucking bandanna no they wont think anything of it.
You just ask me how we gonna do it. Thats what Im here for tell you how.  We the experts.
No.  You gonna stay close to me from now on.  So you dont disappear on me.

He said he stayed with Maurice.

Hes pretty laid back confident.
Its possible.  Why?
Thats right just me.
No.  Course not.
Whoever.  The point is prices are goin up too.  Better get your little black book out Richard.  We got some business to talk about.

Anthony Red stay with the guns  Coma you cover the cannons  Joe Theo come with us  Earl you get on the radio Were gonna fight these fuckers.
Power dive
Good shooting Rafe
The Colonel helped me work it out.
Danny you know how many times I saw you come to school with a black eye or a busted nose and couldnt do a thing about it  for you or for your mother... or your father with his lungs scorched out with mustard gas and more left of his lungs than there was of his spirit? Youve made your sacrifice Danny.  Its time I made mine.
Yeah.
Its a test.  If I asked her to come and she came it wouldnt tell me anything. If I tell her not to come and she comes...then I know she loves me.
So what are you saying?
You left her.  Hows that for a fact?
Fuck you.
Bet they dont dust crops in Japan.
Little less.
Danny what the hell are you trying to do out there?
No.  Youre trying to beat me.
Theyll turn the ship into the wind before we launch.  Thatll help.
The brass is afraid of sabotage.  This makes em easier to protect  and easier to service.
He said youre the only one he ever saw who was better in the air than him.
I was just thinking that war is a series of goodbyes.  Do you think thats why were meeting.  To help us say goodbye to Rafe?
Thank you Sir.
Bombers.
Every other Sunday.  Im heavyweight champion of the West Virginia.
Were all going away.
Why were you sitting here instead of...
Brilliant Admiral.
We have a fighter screen up in case we are attacked Admiral.
Have the planes made it to China?
Peggy Sue
Ive already got some in. I was thinking of making a pie for dinner tonight.  How would you like that?
Goodbye Grandma.
Stag movies. Smokers.
It wouldnt be a lodge without hats.
Not from the guy with the lowest prices in town.
We did for a long time. We just got married too young and ended up blaming each other for missing out on things.
Its not the place. I dont buy that.  Trapped in the same town forever. The price she would pay for her teenage lust.
Oh its not so bad. I have two wonderful kids my own business.  Still knowing what I know now if I had the chance to do it all over again Id sure do things a lot differently.
Thats because you re not a total moron like they are.
Yeah. Youre so lucky. He really loves you too. Hes always telling Walter how wonderful you are.
Its that jerk Walter.
Charlie...
Jesus Peggy. Take it easy. Im not used to that stuff. You always did the bills. Blame the damn post office.
Im not going.
Charlie Am I dead?
Maybe I blocked it out.
Why wait?
Is this slow enough for you?
Youre damn right Jesus Peggy You sure know how to spoil a mood.
And why do you always refer to yourself in the third person like Napoleon? How come it always turns into an argument with you?
Thats just it. You can always get to me. Theres this window in my heart and every time I leave it open you climb in. Unless I close it now nothings ever going to be different
Howd you know about that?
Thats real big of you.
Youre going to listen to me.
Right here. Now sit down.
How could you possibly know what Ive been going through?
Of course.
Do you think anybody in the Fifties ever made love on a bed?
Ill love you too Charlie. Ill love you for twenty years.
Dolores cant you be a little kinder to people? You dont even know the boy. If you werent so neurotic and insecure maybe youd shut up for a while and show some compassion.
Touchy touchy
What why?
Thats a days work. But if thats what you want maybe we can do it tomorrow for your birthday.
I wish she hadnt.
It must run in the family.
Come on wheres your enthusiasm?
But I always thought that you would marry Charlie Carol would marry Walter and I would marry Arthur. Wed all live on the same street and take our kids to the park together and have barbecues every Sunday. Itll spoil everything if you and Charlie break up. That Michael doesnt look like the barbecue type.
They care about you. Theyre just a different generation.
Yes. We had a glorious night together. One day youll remember and write about it.
Grounded? Ha The story of my life. I dont wanna go to my room. I wanna import Japanese cars. I wanna go to Liverpool and discover the Beatles.
Dad.. its not a big deal. Didnt you ever stay out all night when you were young?
I want to help with the family finances. I want you to buy some stocks. And gold. By 1980 gold is going to be worth eight hundred dollars an ounce. Then you sell.
Doing some shopping?
This morning was good.
Thats very thoughtful honey. Its just a slump. Things will pick up.
Richard Nixons going to be President. Nixon wears hats.
Dont worry its just a seasonal slump.
Of course dear. Youre home now.
Oh.Ah...recently. All the kids drink it.
Whats the matter? Did you two have a fight?.
What about?
It was nobody. Ah... hes a poll taker. Im thinking of voting Democrat this year. But dont mention it to your father. How was school today?
Its Grandma. I cant talk to her now.  Im sorry Grandma.
For what?
You know you two are wonderful parents. Im really going to try to behave myself.
Can I tell Diane that Peggy Sue got drunk or is that a deep family secret?  Well?
Of course hell love it. Youre a terrific artist.
You have an incredible memory.
But accidents can happen.
I was once. Richard? Richard Norvik? I didnt recognize you.
Wheres Charlie? I was in town about a year ago and caught one of his commercials. Really made me laugh.
Well you showed them. Youre rich and famous and successful. And you have a beautiful wife.
Im writing a book on kite construction. What did you want to talk about?
This is serious. Nobody can know. Ah Ive returned from the future. I traveled back here 25 years.
I told you Ive already lived my life. I dont know how or why Im here but you have to help me get back. I want to get back to my real life
Im just not the type. Besides I want to get out of here.
Thats what you were talking about yesterday? Everybody does that in the future?
Ah..... theyre very tiny... they look like a fingernail made out of an erector set...
Oh go feel up your hamsters I hear rodents put out.
God damn it Gus you dug up my wife What the fuck is going on around here?
Well were glad to have you Marjorie. You can call me Chase by the way.
He doesnt. I dont know what he has but Im hoping to God its not infectious...
Ill be fine Dad.
Anywhere but here.
Zowie.
You shouldnt ever say that about your parents not even your Dad.
Look if there was even one chance in a million itd work wouldnt you want to try?
Yeah...
Maybe it takes a while...
Yes Bob I do.  Excuse me? Am I being fired?
I said dont worry about it.
Hes not sorry okay fine.  Why dont we see what we find out from the blood work? Ill work on getting a specimen Im sure hospital food could help in that direction. Maybe by then well hear from my doctor and well go from there. Okay? Everybody happy?
I said Everyones going to die Jimmy. But Drews not going to die of AIDS. Theres a cure around the corner and he plans to be around to take advantage of it.
Yes. I think it will be a simple solution. Theyll put it in a syringe inject it into your bloodstream. Itll neutralize the virus. Itll revitalize the immune system and people with AIDS will become healthy again.
Fuck you. This shits probably not doing me any good anyway.
The least you can do is look at me while Im sticking this shit into your arm. Forget the fucking case one hour a day and give me a little of your time.
Thats not what I said.
Thats right. Were on the Positive Plan. You dont have a Fatal Disease you have Manageable Illness.
I hope youre ready for Studs because thats whats on.
More than your friend. Family.
Dont do this Andy.
Im seeing him this afternoon.
About my blood work?
Sounds delightful.
Defined by Websters as harmless.
Its okay. Can I sit down?
As in the vegetable?
Okay okay... They discover you have this horrible disgusting terminal illness and they panic for any number of perfectly valid reasons. Theyre frightened for themselves their families... Maybe its the homo angle. Maybe they dont want to rub elbows with someone whos just popped out of the closet with a terminal case of acne. And how do they explain your status to the client for Chrissake?
What?
Rayisha. Very nice.
One of the partners spotted a lesion on my forehead.
What happens?
I suppose you could say that.
You dont bring your personal life into a law firm. Youre not supposed to uhaveu a personal life really. Anyway I did plan to tell Charles eventually. But then this thing happened at the tennis club...
I love the law. I know the law. I excel at practicing it. Its the only thing Ive ever wanted to do.
Well... many things. But I think the thing I love the most is that every once in a while not that often but occasionally... you get to be part of justice being done. Its really quite a thrill when that happens.
What?
You bet. Well see you later.
Fucking Word Processing lost my Kronos complaint. Which must be filed by fucking five oclock If its late theres no case...  Every problem has a solution.
In my work? Yes. Calculated risks. You have to.
That happened once. People werent talking about AIDS then the way we are now. Or safe sex.
As a homosexual one is often forced to conceal ones sexuality is that right?
One. Here in front of my ear.
Hold on Mom.  Theres no way my client will go along with that.
All I know is you got through your diagnosis fine like a trooper. But when they fired you... you were so devastated Andy... I dont expect any of my kids to sit in the back of the bus. Fight for your rights.
Objection.
Is that a question?
Well... One time Mr. Wheelers secretary Lydia told me Mr. Wheeler had a problem with my earrings.
Fact. Andrew Beckett performed at a consistently mediocre level. Fact. He made a grievous error on a multimillion dollar lawsuit... Fact. He claims he is the victim of lies and deceit. Fact. Andrew Beckett lied to his employers going to great efforts to conceal his disease from them. Fact. He was successful in his duplicity. The partners at Wyant Wheeler did unotu know Andrew Beckett had AIDS when they fired him...
Ill rephrase.  Did you have anything to do with this file being... misplaced?
Im not worried. What are you doing?
Right.
Would you like to have a drink with me? I just finished a game I could use a beer.  I dont pick up people in drug stores every day.
Not especially.
Who?
Is there some kind of expression Ive picked up from Beckett? Some kind of fairy attitude Ive unconsciously adopted? Am I walking different? Some kind of vocal thing? Have I picked up some kind of homo uvibeu?
Yeah... ?
Lisa cmon. One guy sticking his dick in another guys mouth? Its disgusting.
Of course you have a case Now I want you to go with my assistant Iris and fill out some forms. Shell tell you about our fee arrangement.  Mrs. Finley? Any back pain since the accident? Dizziness? Nightmares?
Any women on board?
How did you do that?
Yes we did.
Joseph Miller Your Honor. Macready and Shilts Legal Services.
You had one guy like that?
Helloooo...
Bob. Youre trying my patience. Andrew Beckett is making his private life our business. We gave him Kronos. Did he say Im sick. I might not be able to see this through?
... Its time to get this society back on track
It was just somebody else. From the crash. He was just....
No wed never....Oh God honey you shoulda told me sooner.
Show me your eyes.
Theyre coming.
I got the quickandugly version.
Saw something I didnt like.
Get out of our way.
Confusin me with Johns now  fear was uhisu monkey. I only deal in life and death. All that stuff in between? Some shade of grey my eyes dont see.
Can we switch?
During the landing...when things were at their worst...Owens was at his best. Hes the one who wouldnt let the pilot dump the passenger cabin.
Hey. Bein ballsy with your life now doesnt change what came before  its just stupid.
Nothing we cant repair  so long as the electrical adapts.
Lets wait on the power cells.
He also figured out how to kill the pilot Fry.
I wont give him a chance to grab another ship  or to slash another pilots throat.
I never said I was.
Oh dont use her like that for a smoke screen.
For your own fear.
What the hells it matter?
Were just burnin light here.
 she tried to blow the whole fucking passenger cabin tried to kill us 
What youre goin off too?
Just tell me were still in the shipping lane. Just show me all those stars all those bright beautiful deepspace....
Companys not here is it?
Rain.
There is no safe.
Which half?
Be surprised what these will fetch in the Taurus system. Here. This Wooten here  easy easy. Very rare.
Not staying in here another....
Say that again.
For what? The honor of goin back to some asshole of a cell?
Im willing to take a cut in pay.
Looks clear.
No. Shes not.
Kept calling it murder when I did it.
Sacrifice play. Hack up one body leave it at start of the canyon. Like a bucket of chum.
What do you care?
Did you forget our appointment Cornelius?
You know Dr. Maximus our Commissioner for Animal Affairs?
Do you have any weapons?
Zaius seems to think there might be another jungle beyond the Forbidden Zone. Thats what  well try for. What about you?
Good luck then.
Whats so special about him?
Zira come on. You know they cant   Oh oh. Here comes Number One.
And they fell out of the sky with you?
That was before Dr. Zaius and half the Academy said the idea was heresy.
Yo
That way.
What do you mean made it? Im an animal psychologist thats all. We dont have any authority.
The foundations of scientific brain surgery are being laid right here  in studies of cerebral function in these animals.
Well Dr. Zira? This is a man is he not?
Some apes it seems are more equal than others.
See? He keeps pretending he can talk.
Hes vicious Doctor. Besides its against the rules.
Forget it. Abandon ship.
Were here to stay.
You dont seem very cut up about it.
long pause You know it.
Prove it. If we cant get back its still just a theory.
Climb off me will you
Lets take a look.
Okay.
Youre our optimist Look at the bright side. If thats the best there is around here in six months well be running this planet.
What is it?
I think youre making a mistake.
What?
Keep moving. We cant turn back now.
Why special?
My own purpose is to save this exceptional creature from mutilation.
This hearing is absurd Let me tell my story...
Bailiff Stop this outburst Gag that monstrosity
By your leave Mr. President  the Tribunal has not yet defined the purpose of this inquiry.
Mind your tongue madame.
Oh your case was preordained. In a way you performed a service for the State ...  Because your hearing made it possible for us to expose Zira and Cornelius.  And now the Tribunal has placed you in my custody for...final disposition. Do you know what that means?
Emasculation to begin with. Then experimental surgery. On the speech centers. On the brain. Ultimately a kind of living death.
All right suppose I am a mutant? Why does the appearance of one mutant send you into a panic?
Dont be a fool. Youre outnumbered and outgunned.
All right lets see if youre willing to put that statement to a test.
Wasnt I humiliated? By all of you? Didnt you lead me around on a leash?
We cant.
All right but....  ...youre so damned ugly
God bless you.
Like you I find it difficult.
Ill get him. You get the man in Taylor  NOW. Or Ill Article 15 both your asses. Move

I dont want to hear about it Jackson.
Perhaps I dont take it so lightly.
Well..
I really dont know.
Im supposing.
Im not in the mood for dining and dancing.
Im sure you have.
I havent been invited.
Perhaps Id better get you straightened out Mr. Mitchell. Youve been rather nice to me in a couple of ways. And Im grateful. But I dont think this entitles you to put me on a leash.
Would you mind?
Next time you try that Mr. Mitchell...  ..dont. Im warning you.
Immigration Officer?
Possibly Miss.
I see.
He got in here how?
Bad enough.
Quarter after one. Why?
Is this the best you can do?
I didnt notice him.
Absolutely sure.
I know.  Killaine has a warrant.
Wrote it in the waiting room of the Hudson Bay Store.  With somebodys Pekingese trying to climb into my lap.  Perhaps youre right.  Perhaps I didnt mean it. All I know is that Im licked.
That wasnt why I called you.  Why did I hopewhen I hadnt any right to hope?
How bad is the other thing?  The secret?
But thats what Im doing.  Couldnt they think of that?
That and the fun of it.
And Im begging for my lifeand yours.
Every day of your life youll want me.  Youll never get over it. Every time you see your face in the mirror
Id like a dry Martini. Very dry please.
Beer?  Well all right.
Ale. I dont mind.
Stop saying youre sorry. I want information not regrets.
Ive never been to Florida.
We wouldnt have met at all.
You were there when I last saw him.
Youor the Vancouver Police Department?
You understand perfectly.
I dont want to talk.
I might be able to save you.  If I knew enough.
Very ridiculous.
Youre still a police officer Jeff.  I saw you send those two men away. I know they were watching me.
I understand Betty.  I understand perfectly.
Whos Goble?
Mayfield? Oh that girl you were with last night. You havent hired me yet. Mr. Brandon.
If I call the police your price will go down to a minus sign.
For two hundred?
A thousand.
In the same elevator. It is a public conveyance.
Sometimes.
Leave that one lay.
The new ones are fine. The last set I had gave me all kinds of trouble.
I dont like to be tailed. The lady Im with doesnt like to be stared at. To put the matter in a couple of nutshells I dont like you.
Hows life treating you?
No thanks. I had some. How would you like to take a walk for say half and hour?
Delightfully. Every time Miss Mayfield says something I know less than I did before.  Well I may as well knock off for tonight.  Good night Miss Mayfield. Do let me thank you for your cooperation.
I wouldnt know.
That must hurt.
Would that make me a heel?
Dont kid me.  You dont think she murdered Mitchell.
Your concentrating too hard Killaine.  What about Margo West? She had a motive.  I guess you know by this time whose gun it was?
Now and then.  Mostly just for the fun of it.
I buy my shirts by the dozen. Fortunately.
What?
You dont throw guests out Brandon.
Mr. Mitchell.
I see out friend Larry Mitchell is with us again.
Oh shut up  You havent even got your spats on.
See how easy it is? Perhaps Miss Mayfield left her door unlocked. Or if she didnt theres a passkey on every floor in the linen room. The head porter has a passkey. The bell captain has a passkey. The hotels full of passkeys.
Theyll arrest that girl. Everything points to her.
How clumsy. Id never forgive myself. Good night my dear.
Floater?
Drunkrolling job.  They hit him too hard.
Id suggest a telegram.  Something like this Chief of Police San Francisco.  A licensed private detective named named Martin J. Goble address soandso has been found murdered within our jurisdiction.  His partner name somethingsomething Greer refuses to give us any information. Correction.  Refuses information necessary to our investigation. Can you assist?  Signed Detective Sergeant Driscoll Vancouver British Columbia Police. 
Would you?
Thanks Inspector.  What are your orders about this wire to San Francisco?
The joints not open Mac.  Whos Brandon?
Talk English.  How do I know youre you?
I hate to pull rank on you Sergeant but once in a while...for moral purposes...you might address me as Inspector. In moments of extreme desperation you might even call me sir.
Maybe weve been pretty dumb
If Ive got any sense Im going to call headquarters.
Did we ever really think it was suicide?
Warm water no doubt.
I was in love with him... which shows you the quality of my brains.  Why dont you ask her about the gun?
Of course not.  Thanks for telling me.  I havent seen Mr. Clarendon.
Im interested in who handled it.
That leaves two strangers.
The card says so doesnt it?
I hear shes a very pretty girl.
Aye.  You have a point there.
A little of both sir and perhaps not quiet enough of either.
Whos the girl?
You ought to know why.
Splendid. Now she can return the compliment.
What does it look like?
You already have the checks darling.
A girl you meet on the train. Excuse my bringing it up again.  Be back in an hour. Right?
Its kind of you to see me.
What a shame.
Yes.
Please do.  I was beginning to wonder who this Mr. Penfield was.
To James.  I remember what it was I was going to say.  We were talking about forgetfulness.  The Czech writer Kundera has one of his characters say that the struggle of man against tyranny is the struggle of memory against forgetting.
Yes.
That doesnt matter.  As long as we can get our message through to someone there.  Jill where are those handouts?
Shes fine.  Well actually weve broken up.  Its all over.
No thanks.  Id like to break away
Thank you.
Thats her.
I quite liked it.  I wasnt as enthusiastic as everyone else.
Too bad.  What did your father do?
And youre at this third stage
You just might.
Let me see.
Yes finally.
Suez.  1956.
Take a look at these.
The beds all made up if you want to stay.
She said that?
And youre so beautiful.  What are you doing here?
In that case you should meet my very dear friend James Penfield. Brilliant analyst of recent history and a world authority on the Berlin Airlift.
Yeah my knee got folded about 90 degrees the wrong way.
Not yet.
No Bells Beach Australia.
Yeah right vision is highly over rated.
My man
You do it... you first
Insurance policy.  Now this is going to sting a bit but its for your own growth brah.  Press play.
And let my policy expire?  Sorry.
What if your chute fails Bodhi? Rescind the order.  Let her off the hook shes served her purpose.  Do it man you owe me that much.  Let me hear it before you check out.
No games Bodhi.  Pull the cord Now
I asked them to give me a couple minutes...
Have you seen a little dog?  Kind of a cockapoo lookin thing.  About this big.
Yes sir.
Supervising Special Agent Harp. Now I want you to go work the drop car okay Angelo?  Okay?
What that?
Punk.  Quarterback Punk.
Yeah they control the room well. Stick strictly to the cash drawers.
Never go for the vault.  They never get greedy.
The fucking punks are surfers.
Shutup you might learn somethin youre not careful... So last year Nixon scuffs a counter going over. There was a soil sample.  Non specific mud traces of asphalt oils blah blah... sand and... carnuba wax.  So I became a wax expert.  Theres 80 some uses for this stuff something like five hundred products.
Why cant I just walk around with this thing under my arm and act stoned?  Ask a few questions.
Patience hotshot.  Patience.  Itll be subtle if its here at all.
Hes pushing it through first thing. You better get some sleep tonight it could be an interesting morning.
Angelo we gotta talk.
Did he rob it?
Yeah or cashing a check.
Look we handle it ourselves for right now okay?  We cover the bank whatever.  You and me.  That way if nothing happens or more accurately when nothing happens... I dont get my tits any further into the wringer than they already are.
Shrimp and fries.
Im serious.
No no.  See all my life Ive done things for other people.  In high school I played football because my old man expected me to.  Then my parents always figured Id go to law school so I did.  Football scholarship.  Graduated Phi Beta Kappa
He rents it for the summer.  Bodhi always gets some slick place and throws it open to every surf burnout around.  Most a these guys cant keep a job.  When the swell comes theyre gone they have to ride.
We went out for about five minutes... which is four minutes longer than most of them.  But you cant hold it against him hes... different.
What?
I... I dont know.  I cant describe what Im feeling.
Warm them up.
Fuck you Johnny Utah.  Fuck you Dont you have a soul?  Goddamn you to hell
Who cares
Expendable assets Dillon. Seems Langley is never around when you need them.
Anytime.
Whats that General?
Theres no sign of it.
Youre not getting any navy contracts.
But I do know.  I also know your lines of credit are overextended. If I dont buy your company someone else will...  Ah the escargot.
No.
I see.  Well.  Maybe that means youd have lunch with me sometime then.
Id like to find out.  You dont know anything about me either. Thats why people have lunch.
You what?
How?
If you can figure it out be my guest.
Youre not from L.A. huh?
Day jobs yeah.  Ive tried them.  Turn right.

Vivian may I point out five more nights at three hundred a night is only 1500.
Go by yourself then.  Where you taking me anyway?

Television?
Thank you.  I would.  Nice.
I think its exciting.
Would you please calm down.  Tell me what happened.
Your goddamned friend he thinks the only reason Im with you is for the money.

Shush.  Of course you can.
You wont.
Where are you taking me?
Vivian.  Im paying you to be you.  Be you.  Have you?  Ever been in love with anyone?
I more than liked it.
Vivian I want you to listen to me.  The man realized that it would be better for his future and his sons future if he cooperated.
Its not your concern.  Its... business thats all.
Not all men hit.  And no one is going to hit you anymore.
It was good.
Im leaving.  Dont ya see?  If I stay with you like you want me to therell always be some guy your friends eve treatin me like that... thinkin theyre allowed to.  What are you gonna do fightm all? No.  Ill take my money now please.
Of course yes.  If youll excuse me just a moment 
Eight oclock.  Kross is bringing his son.  Very bright kid watch yourself with him.  Whos this girl youre taking?
Come on Bill dont talk to me about how much moneys involved. Its my money.
Goodbye Bill.
Maybe we should get a pimp. Carlos likes you and 
Yeah.  Well... I gotta split. Goodbyes make me crazy.
Rent.  Youre late.
Of rent I do not bullshit.
What?
Youre a guest here?
Certain ladies make that very easy... Vivian.  John call a limousine for our guest please.  Have it take her anywhere she wishes to go.  Bill the hotel.  See you again sometime soon.
Excuse me?
I dont think we have anything for you here.  Youre obviously in the wrong place.
Scume me.
Do you remember me?
I just might do that.
Then Im here till I die?
I do not marry tonight.
I am no one to be trifled with that is all you ever need know.
They were both poisoned. I spent the last few years building up an immunity to iocane powder.
Are not capable of love is what you mean.
I know who you are  your cruelty reveals everything.
Life is pain Highness. Anyone who says differently is selling something. I remember this farm boy of yours I think. This would be what five years ago?
You mocked me once never do it again  I died that day
I will never doubt again.
You?                                                            58.
Gently
What hideous sin have you committed lately?
I just want you to feel youre doing well. I hate for people to die embarrassed.
Anybody want a peanut?
Well Im carrying three people. And hes got only himself.
Im waiting
 what? 
 where?
The body?
Whats the difference?  Weve got him. Help me here. Well have to force feed him.
We cant wait  the weddings in half an hour and we must strike in the hustle and the bustle beforehand.
How long do we have to wait before we know if the miracle works?
I dont beleeve this.
The Eel doesnt get her. Im explaining to you because you looked nervous.
Because I can stop now if you want.
All right then. No more interruptions.  ... at noon she met her subjects again. This time as their Queen.
As you wish...
The gate has but one key and I carry that.
DEATH FIRST
I swear it will be done.
Of course.
Yes.
Oh I know. The people are quite taken with her. Its odd but when I hired Vizzini to have her murdered on our engagement day I thought that was clever. But its going to be so much more moving when I strangle her on our wedding night. Once Guilder is blamed the nation will be truly outraged. Theyll demand we go to war.
That doesnt leave much time for dilly dallying.
 offer me money 
 offer me everything I ask for 
I WANT MY FATHER BACK YOU SON OFABITCH
That is a noble cause. Give me the sixtyfive Im on the job.
Again. Thank you.
More pursuit than study lately. You see I cannot find him. Its been twenty years now. I am starting to lose confidence. I just work for Vizzini to pay the bills. Theres not a lot of money in revenge.
You seem a decent fellow. I hate to die.
Thank you  Ive worked hard to become so.
Youre sure nobodys following us?
You keep using that word  I do not think it means what you think it means.  My God Hes climbing.
Im afraid so  I cant compete with you physically. And youre no match for my brains.
Morons.
For the Princess?
I smell nothing.
Youd like to think that wouldnt you?  Youve beaten my giant which means youre exceptionally strong. So you could have put the poison in your own goblet trusting on your strength to save you. So I can clearly not choose the wine in front of you. But youve also bested my Spaniard which means you must have studied. And in studying you must have learned that man is mortal so you would have put the poison as far from yourself as possible so I can clearly not choose the wine in front of me.
Ill tell you in a minute. First lets drink  me from my glass and you from yours.
An hour.
A little bit.
Hell pinch my cheek. I hate that.
Honeymoon
Windows so filthy cant tell if its day or night out there.
Sir may I speak to you for a minute?
Where?  What?
Now lets see if we add these figures we get ...
Well its very easy.  You simply raise more money than you really need.
Youve done it yourself only you did it on a very small scale.
Ahhhhhh  But thats where you made your error.  You didnt go all the way.  You see if you were really a bold criminal you could have raised a million.
But what if the play was a hit?
What scheme?  Your scheme you bloody little genius.
Go away from me.  You frighten me.  Sit over there.
Its a little better but you still look angry.
Thank you Leo.  And call me Max. You know I dont let everybody call me Max.  Its only people I really like.
Well Max I dont know Max.  What do you think Max?
Right.
I dont know.  Lets see.  Weve had chocolate vanilla banana  lets go green.
Mrs. Virginia Resnick.  She also owns 50 of the profits.
Im going to buy a toy.  I worked very very hard and I think I deserve a toy.
Stop talking like that you white mouse  Nothings going to go wrong. As a matter of fact today I have taken steps to insure total disaster. At two oclock we have an appointment with none other than Roger De Bris.
No way out.  No way out.
No way out.  No way out.  What?  Who?
Im turning myself in.  Its the only way.  Im going to cooperate with the authorities.  Theyll reduce my sentence and then theres time off for good behavior.  And maybe Ill get a job in the prison library.  So long.
What???
What is it?
Hes a liar and a cheat and a scoundrel.  Hes taken money from little old ladies.  Hes talked people into doing things they never would have dreamed of.  Especially me.  But who has he really hurt? 
Yes.
With whom?
Dont look at the outside look at the inside.  Its the inner Hitler were after.  The young beautiful Hitler who danced his way to glory.
You mean out of business.  Heh heh.
You mean you had the slow fuse in your pocket all the time and you forgot to put it on?
All right.  Finish the job.  Lets get outta here.
Got dag pa dig.
Nice girl.
We cant play today?
Oooh.  I love it.  Hold me touch me.
Wagner...
Hindenburg...
The Graf Spee...
Oh joy of joys  Oh dream of dreams  I cant believe it.  Birds birds do you hear?  Otto Bertz Heintz Hans Wolfgang do you hear?  Ve are going to clear the Fuhrers name.  Fly fly spread the words.
Deutchland Deutchland ... 
Vat?
Stop  Stop  This is insanity.
What have you done LSD?
I told them we invaded England.
In the past two days Ive been to so many motels my eyes are bleary with neon. This is the first one that looked like it was hiding from the world at large.
She might have used an alias. Mary Cranes the real name but she mightve registered...
Tell me all about her.
Of which morning?
No one met her?
You didnt spend the whole night with her did you?
Someone is sitting in that window.
If this girl Mary Crane were here youd have no reason to hide her would you?
Or if she had you say... gallantly protecting her... you wouldnt be fooled... youd know she was just using you. Wouldnt you?
No Just no  I have one of those breaking points like any other man believe it or not and Im near it. Theres just so much pushing I can take and I think...
Who are you friend?
Yes its... nothing wrong with it Im just...
I think I have the necessary papers. Is there a Ladies Room...
You got aspirins? I have something... not aspirins but  my mothers doctor gave these to me the day of my wedding.  Teddy was furious when he found out Id taken tranquilizers
Now. Your sister is missing how long?
Howd you and this detective come to trace her to Fairvale?
And the police havent been able to...
With the forty thousand dollars?
Norman Bates mother has been dead and buried in Greenlawn Cemetery for the last ten years
Just what he told your detective.
May I talk to you?
Lila.
With you.
To begin with where Mary is. Do you?
Look if you two are in this thing together I dont care its none of my business... But I want to see Mary. I want her to tell me shes all right and its none of my business. Then Ill go back to Phoenix and...
You might have doubted for say five minutes or so Sister.
How could I go away? Im in debt up to my...  If she did steal that money...  Its hard to believe she did because its hard to see why she would. Unless she had some wild idea that it would help me... us...
I think shell contact me if she contacts anybody. Why dont you stay here. When she shows up... or calls... be here.
First rate hotel fifty yards up the street. Come on.  After we check you in well go to the drugstore and get you a sandwich. Then well come back here... and wait.
You have an awfully nice habit Sam.
Whenever I start contemplating the panic button your back straightens up and your eyes get that Godlooks outforeverybody look and... I feel better.
Yes.
Sam Why call when we can go?
Just wait here?
Does that mean we cant...
Of course we will.
We were going to get married. Are going to get married
Watch your tenses.
Hospital clean.
The bathroom. Look at how clean it is. The one in our cabin is clean... but this is clean
Do we simply ask him where hes hidden it?
I could stand something regular.
What do I do with my free afternoon walk you to the airport?
Sam
This Meeting you in secret so we can be... secretive You come down here on business trips and we steal lunch hours and... I wish you wouldnt even come.
It is tragic Or it will be... if we go on meeting in shabby hotels whenever you can find a taxdeductible excuse for flying down deductible here...
We can see each other we can even have dinner... but respectably in my house with my mothers picture on the mantel and my sister helping me broil a big steak for three
Sam lets go get married.
You have a vacancy?
I thought Id gotten off the main...
Los Angeles.
Its not as expensive as youd think. Cheap really. Needles thread sawdust .. the chemicals are all that cost anything. 
Friends? Who needs friends.  A boys best friend is his mother.  Youve never had an empty moment in your whole life. Have you?
Oh I do... but I say I dont. 
To a private island like you?
Im very tired. And Ill have a long drive tomorrow. All the way back to Phoenix.
I stepped into a private trap back there  and I want to go back and... try to pull myself out.  Before its too late for me too.
Very early. Dawn.
Then Im free to go...?
Im sorry.
Why?
Maybe you saw Mary
At this hour?
You must remember that bad business out there. About ten years ago...
Arbogast.
It aint only local history Sam its the only murderandsuicide case in Fairvale ledgers Mrs. Bates poisoned this guy she was... involved with when she found out he was married then took a helping of the same stuff herself.  Strychnine. Ugly way to die.
Havent any.
That would be a rather extreme reaction wouldnt it?
I didnt think so.
Left Phoenix under her own steam?
Explains the private detective. He traced her to the Bates place.  Whatd he exactly say when he called you?
Yes In the house behind the motel. I pounded and called but she... just ignored me.
Did I?
Whatspecial autopsy?
Was it quotMeirschultzquot?
Indeed he has often told me.
I am certainly glad to hear it. I know hell be pleased.
ShshI want to have a few words with you quietly.
I knew there was a catch in this some placebut spill it. Quiet and dramatic. MAXWELL In the other room I have a crazy woman that I have been treating.
Quiet will you? This is ser ious. Our lives are in danger.
How about me getting the help. Shes quiet now isnt she?
Take him to the psychopathic hospital.
Maybe youre right.
Yeahthousands and right in my back yard.
You found Buckley?
Oh Maxwell? Hes left.
Do you have many patients doctor?
Joseph returns from the room where Gisle is. He has evidently succeeded in calming her. He goes and sits in the chair where Nikolas sat. He rests his head in his hand. He sees the open diary and begins reading it.
No  the only thing I did for him was to keep track of the man named Worth that runs the place where you arrested me tonight.
I wondered. Did he invite you to lunch or did you invite him?
Ill have it for supper.  So long.
Delighted Im sure. 
Whats nice about her? ... a hardboiled little gold digger.
Im glad you told me. Good night Mr. Burton.
It is no trouble at all my child. This is the strange vicarious pleasure that remains for me  to see others enjoy the beauty I used to create.  My footing is not too secure.
And I have no desire to hurt you. You will always be beautiful. Think my child in a thousand years you will be as lovely as you are now.
Dont take my word for it. Get down there yourself and give a look.
You mean he was colored?
Nothing doing. This is my percentage. You birds are going to get yours. And anyhow I found this dump.
What do you mean you poor ham This is New Years
All right you said I was fired. Well I quit Give the assignment to somebody else. 
Get out of here.
I want to see the original pictures of Joan Gale.
No kiddin. Whats your idea?
About the Gale girl I mean. Where do we go from there? What of it?
Almost certain.
Yes you could. Cut out this rotten business and act like a lady. Marry me.
Say if youre stringin me OldTimer ...
Its all yours.
Stories scarcer than caviar at a street cleaners banquet and he says bring me a yarn. All I have to do is get a story.
Gee thats great. After the bad opening that night the old boy was pretty blue. This will pep him up. Have you told him about it?
For a few minutes the afternoon before  before 
They didnt give me a chance. We had a couple of drinks and she was all right then. She seemed happy.
Not even if it gives you a clean bill of health?
I told you what to do. Drive around the corner out of sight of the house. I want to get a closer look at the place.
No  No  I  I  I dont want to see it. 
You go in for dangerous things.
I suppose this is going to sound absurd. Ive only known you twentyfour hours but Im in love with you.
Dont ask any questions. Come on
Youre insane.
That is unfortunate. They will have to wait.
He cant hear you.
Good. Well Ill be seeing you.
Thanks.
Thats the physicists playground.
Its an experiment.
What universe are you in Paul?
That they tunnel magically through any obstacle defying the practical laws of physics in order to end up together 
Sex isnt ugly sex is one of the most beautiful things in life the creative power of the universe is behind it.
But we must respect that power we must be in awe of it.
I dont think you are sufficiently in awe of it. Get the castor oil.
What terrible thing in Cave Springs?
But Rose how could such a thing as that happen?
What did you expect?
Ha ha ha thats some idea a cantaloupe.
Buddy quit that youre just a child youre not supposed to be interested in such things.
You know that Daddy of yours is the funniest man the things he says you never know whats going to come out of his mouth next.
That was very interesting. Thank you Rose.
Rose I have a serious favor to ask you.
Rose since youre here in bed with me and everything and Ive already touched your titty...
Please Rose. Im curious thats all I have a natural curiosity its only human. Youre my friend arent you? Dont you like me?  I like you Rose a lot  in fact I love you.
But why if Im not hurting you?
No. No Im all right.  Oh God what have I done? I have robbed a cradle and fallen into hell  I must be crazy a child like you. Oh God oh Lord. This is awful this is terrible I gotta get outta here
Well he might be that man who followed me home from the store the other day. But I dont know who he is Buddy I really dont.
Rose you are too uncritical of people.
Rose I have got doubts about that doctor and so does Daddy.
You wont die Rose.
I dont want to know...
Shes getting herself up to go out.
Yeah.
Is that all?
Buddy that was my place.
Rose says shes goin to have a baby and she sure looks it but I dont think so.
Hello Daddy. How are you?
Dave Wilkie of all people was sitting by me on the plane  her first husband. Its funny you would mention Rose. Did you hear from her?
Oh no no she got all over that. Rose is fine. Lets sit down son.
No its another thing. I was going to write you about it but since you were coming down anyway I thought Id wait till you got here. What did Dave Wilkie have to say?
She was fiftysix son. Of course she didnt look it nowhere near it. The cancer came back Im afraid I fibbed about that. But it was very quick son. She was in the hospital only two weeks and the last week she didnt know anything.
Its true son. The girl with the cornflower eyes is dead she is no more
Any major operation is dangerous. However as we know from her previous illness shes a very strong girl.
I think we both know her.
Yes its so nice I thought Id work outside.
Rose you and Brother wait in the car. I want to speak for a moment Lo Mr. Hillyer.
But morals come from the heart not from rigid rules and empty laws. And in her heart Rose has never hurt anyone and she never would. Therefore shes not immoral. Not really.
I dont care where the polecat studied.
She cant get a job its a depression. And we cant just throw her out on the street.
No she doesnt shes fine fine. Shes perfectly healthy dont give her ideas.
Just a minute Rose you dont understand. This isnt a dirt farm like the one you were born on its nice. A neighbor of Cousin Hops I talked to him on the phone a fine man... its not a farm damn it its a beautiful dairy establishment Stop crying Rose Do you hear me? Stop crying its ideal
Poor thing dont cry Rose. I know you feel awful but dont cry honey nobodys perfect. Whos the father dear?
Thats why Im asking her who the father is. Its the most vital question of all. Whos the father dear?
Well yes shes happy. Of course Dave doesnt have her life force not at all. There isnt much furniture in his house just a table and one or two chairs whereas Rose has furniture coming out of the windows.
All right. Now as head of this household I have a couple of remarks to make. It is my dear wifes belief which I accept although I do not totally grasp it that to hire a person to do household work is a criminal practice. Therefore you are here not as a servant you are here as a friend as a guest and hopefully as a member of this family. You will eat your meals with us you will share life itself with us  in love and harmony dear Rosebud in love and harmony. Do you understand me?
Yes crazy about you Kiss me Mr. Hillyer
Well it has buttons.
My rose. Its kind of like a motto. People will say there comes Rose with her rose.
Oh anywhere downtown.
Yes sir.
Boy for four or five days there I didnt think Id live. But Im my old self again
Oh no sir.
I have to go back to the hotel. Im on duty at the desk and who knows a quest might arrive. I will see you at suppertime Rose.
Where is he? Where have you got him hid?  Ah ha
Hes a nice boy youd like him. He wants to be a fireman.
Whats the use there aint none.
Tennessee?
What?
All right tell us Rose what makes you think youre pregnant?
Page proof of a book Im working on.
Well actually we have a little black boy named Hert who lives in the garage. He does it for me.
Thats right Dave Im headed for Glenville on a whisperin jet.
Thats correct  outside it not in it. As for the job well the Jewboy suppliers give me a lot of grief and we use a pile of niggers to haul and tote and they aint worth a sorryass damn.  But I can build anything Buddy. Give me the plans and I can build a goddamn staircase to the moon. Its a fact I can build anything...  ... but she never believed that. Oh hell no she never believed in me.
Doubted my ability all along the little bitch. I never remarried Buddy you know that dont you?
Mother Buddy says Rose got in his bed last night and he fiddled with her and she snorted and had a fit  and he says I would too if I was grownup. Is it true Mother  would I sweat and snort and froth at the mouth and have a horrible fit like he says?
She looks terrible just awful.
It is kind of amazing. The dentist says she has perfect teeth there isnt a cavity in her mouth.
Yes I understand you but you have misunderstood me completely.
Actually of course I wont operate I dont do major surgery. Dr. Hardy will operate and of course hell be guided by your wishes in this respect.
Well its rather interesting about Brother actually. I realized the remarkable thing he had when he was six weeks old. He looked at me and understood me he knew exactly who I was. I know it sounds crazy but its true. Hes very remarkable he was born for the ministry and could move millions but he doesnt know that yet. I have to warn you about him he can be very dangerous there is an evil streak in him a streak of pure sheer meanness. But at heart Brother is saintly and that is why he was born for the ministry even if he doesnt know it.
Rose you work too hard. Why dont you go sit down somewhere and drink a CoCola?
Yes Maam.
Doll you and Waski run on too.
I know it was bad honey. Im sorry...
I know its embarrassing... but who were you exposed to dear? ROSE Well now Mrs. Hillyer I... ahh thats kinda hard to say.
I dont mind.
Well... well thats wonderful Rose.
Im looking at this poster and Im thinkin I dont remember seeing films like this when I was in school.
... okay... you made your point.
Ill tell you what... I think its all youve got.
Now you know what to watch for...
Hey listen... Ill give you something else Kittle.  Anything. Remember... remember that corpse washed up on Huntington Beach?  It was never identified...
Where you been hiding greasefist? Weve been looking for you.
Alright  Alright... put me down...
Its the way you say it like theres something more too it.
Thank you concerned citizen.
Ill give you a fucking hoot if you dont shut up back there.
Whoa thanks man.  These are cool. Theyll be collectors items.
We catch em I wanna be first to hurt em.  Promise me I get to go first.
No you cant.
Well... we shouldnt rush into this right?  Lets talk about it.
Whos that?  Zimmermanns moneyman?
Clench your teeth so when we land you dont accidentally bite off your tongue.
No but it should.
Youll cry like a great big blubbering baby.
We have to find Kittle.
Well I got something..  PopSweets accounting ledger for the DiscoStrip.  All the money transactions.  Look...  Someones putting their initials beside the weekly totals.  Like theyre acknowledging a deposit.
Cant you say something nice once?
Im waiting till the times right.
No.
Weve got the tape to prove it.
Its our job.
Today you have a rare opportunity to make a big difference in your chosen field.  By your able leadership and with great conviction and strength of character you will come up a winner.
First of all the Constitution wasnt writtem till 1787...

You wont get another chance at this Admiral.
Yoda will always be with you.
You cannot escape your destiny.
I cant kill my own father.

You have done well Lord Vader. And now I sense you wish to continue your search for young Skywalker.
A small Rebel force has penetrated the shield and landed on Endor.
Then you must go to the Sanctuary Moon and wait for them.

Hello I think... I could be mistaken. Theyre using a very primitive dialect.  But I do believe they think I am some sort of god.
Its against my programming to impersonate a deity.
The Emperor does not share your optimistic appraisal of the situation.
Then perhaps you can tell him when he arrives.
Quiet.
Just...images really. Feelings.
She was very beautiful. Kind but...sad.  Why are you asking me all this?
Youre wrong Leia. You have that power too. In time youll learn to use it as I have. The Force is strong in my family. My father has it...I have it...and...my sister has it.
But why must you confront him?
I will not turn...and youll be forced to kill me.
Search your feelings father. You cant do this. I feel the conflict within you. Let go of your hate.
I will not fight you father.
I will not fight you.

My philosophy is if you dont have a sense of humor youre better off dead.
I resent that innuendo  My wife is completely innocent.
Well Acme had the will in his pocket that night at the club.  It was gone in the morning when the cops found the body.
And when theyre done laughin  theyre gonna call the cops.  That guy Angelo would rat on you for a nickel

I followed you to the Maroon Studios. When I heard those shots I thought Id help you and investigate the inside of this trunk.
Not before I satisfy my sense of moral outrage.
Thats because its DisappearingReappearing Ink.  Shows up three days later.  Gives you enough time to get away from the victim so he doesnt punch you in the nose.  Great gag.
Good idea.
From this box here...
I will bite my thumb at them which is a disgrace to them if they bear it.
Then I defy you stars JULIET JULIET I will hence tonight.

The last is true the sweeter rest was mine.

More Light and light more dark and dark our woes.
Thou wast the prettiest babe that eer I nursed.
I dreamd a dream tonight.
Well what was yours?
Thou hast most kindly hit it.
Farewell ancient lady farewell
I am for you.
Always in a rush you are.  All these years Ive known you you could never wait for anything.
Finding this package is a thing easier said than done.  We dont even know what it is.  What did we steal?
So where do you go from here?
Which leads us to...
Best beer in the world known to man or God.
It means I was worried that all the time you spent away from the fold might have affected you.  Youve been living the life of the hired gun  the well paid hired gun I might note.  Theres no glory to it but there are those that like it.
No Seamus.  I heard you the first time.
Is that right?
I probably do.  But for the time being Im willing to forget about it...
Not likely.  Once yeah I was  but there wasnt an inch of profit in it and Im a cash oriented girl if you take my meaning.  Im a hired gun same as the rest of you and thats all any of us needs to know about the other.
Good because it cost enough.  Theres cheaper phones by far than that one man you better fucking use it.
Theres a problem...
Ill destroy whatevers in the case.
But you hate each other
A post office box.
Much to your disappointment no doubt.
Im in the middle of saving you people a great deal of money  the least you could do is have the decency to pay me
Thats it.
Hello my friend.  He doesnt look French to me Vincent.
I suppose I want to know how a man like you is created.
Anybody tries to unpleasant me Ill put two between his eyes  one to do the job and the other to make sure it takes.
Why dont you go do better then...
I blast the lead car into oblivion...
I dont think so.
No thanks.
To see a man about a thing.
Thats what I thought.
Lets just say I thought the conversational possibilities were limited.  Of course I might have brought Gregor but he didnt seem like the right candidate  for this.
I just wanted to see something.
I needed to see if you were a cop.  Im a popular man with the police Sam and whenever they try to catch me they always do it with an inside guy  some man on some job who seems more trustworthy than all the others put together.  And thats the guy you have to watch out for.  I hate cops...
Know what?
But you cant.
Its my job.
Yeah.  We need out fucking heads examined.
If Im going to die for the CIA Im going to go out smoking.  Besides theres half a forest between us and them they cant see a goddamned thing.
Why then Sam dont you act like this is a job like any other?  Surely if you are a hired gun you realize that some times you just have to walk away without getting what you came for.
Finish the job...
You dont owe me a goddamned thing Vincent and you know it.  You stepped in front of a bullet for me.  I owe you a heavy debt.
I dont know.  Nobody knows except a bunch of people who are too dead to tell us.  Theres probably a couple of guys back at the Company who know but I dont think they plan to tell me anytime soon.
Its an international thing.  Several different peoples involved criminals from all over the world experts brought together to do a job.  But maybe the most interesting thing about it is that preeminent in the plot we find the Russian Mob and the IRA in bed together. An unlikely group of partners.
Why didnt you kill him?
Matter of face theres this flick Ive been hearing about.  I havent seen it but from what I hear its pretty cool.
I get the picture.
I cant get enough of it.
Sure thing and 
The horniest dog in Nevada.
Maybe.  Who cares?
Whats that?
He saw everything
Listen.  Do you want to go to jail? Taking evidence tampering with a crime scene.  You know what theyd do.
Exactly.  This is our little secret partner.
Well doesnt he?  Besides if the DEA heard that tape wed be behind bars right now.  Just call it the cost of doing business.  This whole thing is screwed up.  Im thinking.  Maybe we should tell em the truth...
All we have to do is get our hands on the original tape.  Well set him up somehow.
Yeah I mean youre coming unglued Jesse.
No.
Like hell it is.  This is Jesse Jesse
It was all used.  Random numbers. How can they trace it?
Two thousand...
Just take it in stride.
You better believe it if you know whats good for you
Hello.
Hes irresponsible.
I might have to look into that...
Nothing.
You deserve it is the occasion.
Nothing happened?
There isnt gonna be a next time. Were gonna get out of here.
Itd have to be Switzerland to make sure Dwayne never finds us.
Ill be there for you.  He wont try anything while Im there.  I promise.  Ill protect you.
Im not sure why.  Its just Ive never been anywhere else...
I dont know.  My friends...
I dont believe it.
You know I do.
A week ago at most.
Yeah.
You didnt answer my question. Are you saying my word is of no value to you?
First you question my integrity then you call me stupid...  ...that hurts son.
Dont worry the real men are in charge now.
Excellent. Ill go down with you.
Fine.  The information doesnt leave this room.
Did you say After Midnight?
So there was money there  Who the hells money is it?
Well I just uh you know...
Anything...specific?
Hmmm...
Oh yeah.  Between here and Vegas we get a lot of customers.  All types.  Even had an officer just like you.
Dammit youre persistent.  I dont want to listen to this anymore.  No more bets with you.
Take it or leave it.
Sort of.
I cant hear a word youre saying
And if we refuse?  Your tampering with evidence isnt exactly a misdemeanor did you ever consider that?
So I want the money and I want it now.
We gotta Jesse.  Its tough but you didnt leave us any choice.  We gotta know where the tapes are.
Absolutely positively.
So someone did get away.
No it doesnt.  Neither does his blank tape.  Any news on that?
Were going to find out.
No sir.
How much is that?
Im with the band.  Im the lead singer.
What??  Whered you hear that?
Youve been asking loud questions in all the wrong places all morning.  How come you always save me for last James? When are you gonna learn.  Shit dont happen I dont know about.
I know Teddy Wu is cranking out a pretty good double sawbuck  but you knew that too didnt you?
One of my regulars lost fifty thousand dollars at the table here last week.  I was about to send my boys down to tune his ass up when the guy comes in and pays off the whole thing.  Including the vig  brand new sequential hundred dollar bills.  I knew something was wrong.  Cause this guys got a regular job no way he comes up with fifty grand in cash. But I tested the bills infrared.  The whole thing.  And they checked out. 100.
Isabella Molina from San Juan.  That seat is taken.
I dont think so.

So whats your story?
In 1959 the United States was very friendly with the Shah of Iran.  We wanted his oil so for the Shahs birthday the government gave him a gift  a U.S. Treasury Intaglio press.  The only one to ever leave the country. Five years ago Ricky Tan bought that press on the black market.

Its a bomb.
We both know you would never take a bullet for someone else.
Mind your own business.
There was no sex.  She was very traditional.  We were waiting until we were married.
Once in a while steamed dumplings.  But only when she was drunk.
Tell me the truth Carter.  Do you think I have a good voice?
I knew it.  What does she know.  You want me to sing something?
A Chinese man discovered electricity.

This money is evidence.
The Plaza Hotel?

The Praying Mantis school in Bejing?

The police can protect you.
Put the plates down.  Its over.
Animals kill only from hunger or fear. The man you seek is lower than a serpent.  ...he kills for money.

I didnt say I didnt.  You assumed I didnt.
I am not responsible for your assumptions.
What?
Hey stop.  Were just gonna wind up in some bar drinking to forget all the things we shoulda done and then youll start singin Beach Boy songs again. Then Ill really get depressed.
Hey everybody fits in here. Look at L.A. man.  Nobodys from here.  My mommas from Detroit my dads from Atlanta they met in Texas got married in Vegas and I was born in Alabama.  So where the hell am I from? Kenya?
Stooly.

No way in the way  Im talkin back up Johnson. Im in charge And I need you baby.
Thats it You can attack me but when you attack my car I cannot forgive You in the back girl
At this point we dont have much.
Just make him think youre following leads.  Interview some suspects look at fingerprints do detective shit.  I dont care.  I just dont want to see him or you for that matter until this is resolved.  Now we want to make a good impression dont we?  His plane lands in an hour. Dont be late.
Why dont you try the assignment.  Or should I call and ask for somebody who can handle it?
Nobody touches me.
Do it
How did I do this? Maybe you didnt notice but Im in jail
You dont. He finds you. Through his people.
You have run out of time.  The amount now is two hundred million.  I will call later with instructions.  You will either deliver the money or pick up the body of your daughter.
I understand sir. But you are an honored guest of the United States...
Yes sir me too. The State Department has authorized release of the funds. Well have to make the first drop at 7.  As soon as they pick up the money weve got em.
Soon Young dont worry.  You will have many friends very soon.  You will see.  America is a very friendly place.
Let him come to the wedding.  Youre not running right?  Say it. Im not...
Hold it  Hold it  I think were taking this too fast.
How about  I hope youll be very happy together?
Thank you.
I didnt want to find out I wasnt for her in the fourth quarter.
Im happy here where Im supposed to be.  But if you ever become a Catholic may I ask you a favor Maggie?
Bob is making her visualize the ceremony.
I left four messages.  You dont return my calls.
What?
Where do you think shes going?
Or does she pick NGBS  Nice Guys But...  Nice guys but Im cheap. Nice guys but he lives with his mom... Nice guys but he just out of prison.
Whoa Ike.  Getting a complex buddy?
Unbelievable she got to you.
Are you a reporter?
No about her getting that asshole from New York fired.
Betty Trout.  Five dollars.
 The luau for Maggie.
Youll answer my questions?
But the most interesting thing here is that I dont see the rose tattoo that Ive heard about on your back.
He is not
Sevenfifty.
So?  Is that what you said to her?
You dont know.
Can you fix it?
Yes it is.  And it doesnt mean anything.
What kind of Dead Head gets a temporary tattoo?
Supportive?  You werent being supportive.  You were being scared. Just like now.  You are the most lost woman I have ever laid eyes on.
I dont know.  I uh  I frankly dont even want to talk about it.
Well you do have the dress.
I dont have much choice in the matter now do I?  But I cant speak for Italics.  Traitor
Its something Ive always wanted to do.
I wanted to talk to you about why I run or ride away from things.
I was because if you said yes right away I wouldnt get to say this next part.  And Ive been practicing it.  Ready?
I guarantee that well have tough times.  I guarantee  that at some point one or both oof us will want to get out. But I also guarantee that if I dont ask you to be mine Ill regret it for the rest of my life. Because I know in my heart  youre the only one for me.
Its probably because you got him fired.
On anything male that moves?  As opposed to anything male that doesnt move?
No I dont think youre like Im charming and mysterious in a way that even I dont understand and something about me is crying out for protection from a big man like you.  Very hard to compete with.  Especially to us married women who have lost our mystery.
No.  Im weird.  Weird and mysterious are two different things.
I think youre right.  Is there anything I can do to make it up to you?
See this is a mature relationship. Shes really found it.
No no.  I saw eight geese flying in a V.
Wedding.  Wedding.  You just have to get the rest of your ducks in a row.
Yeah.
 whos married to 
 because Irene threatened to put the dog to sleep if he didnt 
I love you.
Nope.  Not even when I was young.
How will I get back to Baltimore Saturday?  Oh God I forgot my present for your stepmother  I took it inside by accident.
And then Ill see you in New York 
You couldnt.
Not really.  Look Annie I love you.  Lets leave that out of it.  I dont want to be someone youre settling for.  I dont want to be someone anyone settles for.  I have a life insurance policy Im fully invested in growth stocks I have a paid subscription to Home Rox Office I have no sexual diseases I have been steadily employed in a part of the economy that isnt soft I have expectation in the way of inherited wealth I dress nicely I am a member of the private sector an independent voter I dont watch Monday Night Football the only thing wrong with me is that I am allergic to wheat strawberries penicillin pollen nuts and wool.  There are plenty of women who see me as the brass ring.  If you dont  marriage is hard enough without bringing such low expectations into it isnt it?
Theres practically a whole book about how that statistic is not true 
Nothings with me.
Not.
I am not the sort of person who listens to callin radio shows 
I dont know.  I mean what if I never meet him? What if this man is my destiny and I never meet him?
Good.  Perfect.  Ill be in New York with Walter I can squeeze it in.
You never told me you left your husband because he went on a diet.
Youd probably have to go somewhere to really look into it.
Is this crazy?
Good night.
He said hello.
I saw her.  She looked just like this 
Well its the same woman.  And he was crazy about her.  What is this?  This is from Seattle.
So I mailed your letter.
Okay.
So you want a financial is he a deadbeat we can do a DB 
A sense of humor.
Oh.  Like Glenn Close in that movie.
I got married because Betsy said we had to break up or get married.  So we get married.
Yes I did.
Well move them 
Then how do you explain that you both ordered exactly the same sandwich except for the bread? How many people in this world like lettuce and tomato without something else like tuna?
What?
Magic.
Mom we already...
Magic.
Hello Sam this is Dr. Marcia Fieldstone on Network America.
I think its hard for him to talk to you about all this. Maybe we could talk and it would make him feel a little better.
Have you had any relationship since?
Whats she talking about?
Its not that late in Seattle.
Yeah.
How about rapacious and love starved?
Right right.
Nobody knows.  It changes practically every day.  How much money do you have?
I dont think I have to now.
Nobody else is going to know it was us.
I forgot to mention.  Jed called 
Thank God.  Something you dont know.  Its a single white female.
It doesnt.  They ask you.
What do you think?
What was?
Youre worried were going to be all right.  Were going to be all right.  I remember sometimes youd have nightmares as a baby.  Your mom would hold you and rock you and sing you a song.
There she is.
No.
I just called for a second.
I cant know what I said but were not going.
You must be Jonah.
Hes over at the boat show. Hell be by later.  Its so beautiful here.
I tried to talk to her...  It was like I knew her.  Weird.
Would you follow UherU through an airport?
So whatdya say? Ill get the check and Ill call you in eight months.
I read the same article...
Why didnt you give a warning signal?
Theres nothing stopping you.
Whose side are you on anyway?
What do you mean  sex equality?
So much the better.
He will if he wants us to go on blasting.
Sure. Where theyre negotiating. In the company office. Well go up there and picket the place.
No. No. I cant. If Ramn ever found me on a picket line ...
Dont you worry. Well get some action.
Whats more important than sanitation?
I see. The men. Youll strike maybe for your demands  but what the wives want that comes later always later.
All right. Have your strike. Ill have my baby. But no hospital will take me because Ill be a strikers wife. The store will cut off our credit and the kids will go hungry. And well get behind on the payments again and then theyll come and take away the radio...
If I think of myself its because you never think of me. Never. Never. Never...
Antonio paid for it.
I did forget. Lus told me.
Its nothing. Just a little catch ...
He was born fighting. And born hungry.
Yes.
Im going back tomorrow.
Okay. Then tomorrow I take the kids with me to the picket line.
Im okay. But its nice to be home.
Hunting.
Sun up.
Who said anything about giving up? Ill never go back to the company on my knees. Never.
You talk of dignity? After what youve been doing?
Then whys the company hanging tough? Theyve signed contracts with other locals  why not this one?
Well youre the organizer. You work out strike strategy  and most of the time youre dead right. But when you figure everything the rankandfiles to do down to the last detail you dont give us anything to think about. You afraid were too lazy to take initiative?
New York? Youre not the Company President by any chance?
I thought maybe you forgot...
Shes coming. Charley Vidal gave her a lift.
The what
You should have helped her without being asked.
You ... You ... Id expect it of an Anglo yes ... but you ...
Yeah? First door on the right. It aint that dirty.  Just kinda filthy is all.
Shhh.
Um coupla eight balls oughta do us.
How about in the house?
I understand. Thanks anyway.
I was thinking Alice Cooper.
Leave me out of this.
Colette ...
Look its really none of my business but why dont you just dump this guy?
Theres nothing to understand. The guy is a pig.
Why? They dont hold him for more than a day or two.
Dont worry. Hes out of town.
I dont want anything. Why are you so suspicious?
You dont like the tune find another station.
Therapy session is over.
Please open the door Danny.
What about a battered womans shelter? You can move you kid in with you.
They would have killed you too.
Im fine. Little nervous...little disappointed that I didnt finish this myself.
Your hatred makes them stronger and you weaker.
Its not too late to show her youre sorry.
Guess its our turn.
I know a guy.
Sorry.
You. Youre smooth. You use words like dire and shit.  You got language skills man.
Can you set that up?
I think on account of his nose.
He doesnt have one.
John Fitzgerald Kennedy.
Tem thousand dollars. Everything I could spare.  Its for you.
Its you I didnt have a picture or nothin so I had to describe you to the guy. Not bad though huh?
Im not a tweaker.  I dont use drugs. I never had.
I cant tell you.
Im sorry. I couldnt.
Youre a good man. Jimmy the Finn.
Um I think the Warren Commission has been closed for a while.
Crank or glass?
Make me an offer.
I deal in U.S. pounds friend. None of that faggot metric crap for me.
Hey okay.
Pull your pants down.
What?
What the fuck are you gonna do about it dickhead?
Just the way the world works.  Look as far as tweakers go you arent a bad guy.  You never hurt anyone but yourself as far as I know.
This chink have a name?
Look man I just wanted to make some dough and disappear.  I didnt want to wait around for Domingo to figure out who doubled back on him.
Newsflash Tanner. Im a fucking rat.
Whats to stop him from just ripping me off then?
Im afraid so Danny.
My name is Tom.
It speaks
To who?
And what does this have to do with me?
What?
Anyone ever ask you to be such a disrespectful smartass all the time?
And he probably only told two people and they probably only told four people and on and one. You know better than to tell a secret to a tweaker Flynne.  Might just as well broadcast it on the evening news.
Oh theyre all that and the proverbial bag of chips.
Several possession charges but nothing major.
They have. But they never found a lab.
What if he caps me before you can make a move?
Im making the small buy tonight ... if I dont get beaten to death with a wheelchair or something.  If everyone is happy well do the big deal later in the week.
Hey do you think you could eat me if you had to?  And if so which part do you think you would find the most delicious?
Okay okay.  Theres a house up there. Ill go ask for directions.
What do you mean?
Thats not good in prison. Its just not good.
Good work Flynne.  Youre a firstrate rat.
Dont worry about it.
I thought you were done.
Where are your men now?
Im sending Simpson to take over for you the division is going to Caen youre not coming with us I have something else for you.
Theres a Private James Ryan who parachuted in with the Hundredand First near Ramelle.  I want you to take a squad up there.  If hes alive bring him back to the beach for debarkation.  Take whoever you need youve got your pick of the company.
Hes the last of four brothers the other three were killed in action. This is straight from the Chief of Staff.
Spit it out Captain.
Thank you sir.
No kidding.
You must be a hell a shot.
You got somethin against the Capn?
Nope he aint Wade.
Like hell you did.
In the shadow by those two trees.
Sir I aint feeling so chipper on account of Wade.
Youll grieve the way I tell you to goddamned grieve.  There is no Wade there was one but he died a long time ago hes been dead for so long you can hardly remember his name you understand?
Good now get your goddamned gear.
Thats General Gavins.  His lap dog told me if anyone breathes on it Ill get busted and if anyone so much as touches it with their little finger Ill get court marshaled. If you were to take it theyd shoot me.
Plenty.
You dont count.
Those guns are close.
But sir...
Maybe.
Since when have things been normal?
Theyre fine.  As long as they can gripe theyll be alright.
How about I go right sir?
More morphine hurry up come on come on...
Lets just find someplace.
Bits and pieces.
It could be worse.  You know the first thing they teach you at O.C.S.? Lie to your men.
Not in so many words but they tell you you can have all the firepower in the world and if your men dont have good morale its not worth a damn.  So if youre scared or empty or halfastep from a Section Eight do you tell your men?  Of course not.  You bluff you lie.
I think youre right Keith.
Were going to hope like hell the tanks were on their way somewhere else.
Sure meet me at the top well start the paperwork.
Dont worry were the only Rangers this side of the continent weve got to be first into Caen.
No Im not Kaback is honest.  Or what about Faulkner?  Or that little guy with the glasses?
Sure Reiben.
Reiben theres a fairly good chance youre not going to die at all.
You have orders too.
Yes sir as a final note Id like to say fuck our orders fuck Ramelle fuck the cheese capital of France and while were at it fuck Private James Ryan.
I dont like that one.
But we accomplish the mission.
ON THE BRIDGE  WERE COMING IN.
See to it.
I coach the baseball team too.
FIRES a burst.  More Germans drop.
Looks at Miller sees him growing weak starting to sway.  He gently tries to move Miller aside.
As I was saying before I was so rudely interrupted my grandfather got old as grandfathers tend to do. He needed someone to take care of him.  We move around all the time going from one mine to another so we had to put him in a home.  Nice enough place but kind of depressing. But not for Granddad.  He just convinced himself he was on a cruise ship going to Tahiti he had his own cabin first class with room service.  It just so happened that the weather was always lousy so he never bothered to go up on deck. Happiest guy you ever saw until the day he died.
I care.  Dont you know what Caens famous for Sarge?
We know.
Hes fast Captain I saw him.
Goddamn it...Goddamn it...Goddamn it...
Since I was nine years old.  They got a lot of explosives around mines. Me and my little brother could get into any warehouse you ever saw. Damn we had fun
Twentyfourfive.
We believe that your father operates in a large pool of cash that comes from phoney billings phoney patients.  Weve been investigating him for five years.  We believe that when they die he takes their money.
And your former wife.
For going to school?
Listen I dont know your name but what are you doing for lunch?
Cmon Lloyd.
Lloyd send her flowers write her a letter.  Something.

Dad Im so glad I went.  Goodnight.
Dad Im so sorry.  I know this is a bad time.
Youre going.
Diane Im not asking you to sever all relations with the boy. Give him a present here let him know you still care.  Give him this pen.
Swear to god I need to know the truth.
I trusted you.  I stood up in court five years ago and I picked you.
No.  I told you everything you lied to me.  I would have done anything for you.
Hi.
Diane I do have a history with this man and its not the greatest.  I see you so seldom Id really rather know about you.
You know I dont even know if youve got a young man in your life?
Alright.
Okay.  Oh heres Ray.  Just talk to him because when you dont your mouth turns down.

Goodbye.

Yeah.
I hereby surrender my duties as keymaster give me a beer.
They knew of you.  Now they know you.
Well my parents split up when I was thirteen and... god I actually had to... I went into court and I had to choose between the two of them.  So I chose my dad.  It just felt safer that way you know?
Twisted?

The Jewish workers salary you pay it directly to the SS not to the worker. He gets nothing.
Thank you.
Oskar 
You dont?  I do.  I see a difference.
There will be generations because of what you did.
Theres taking money and theres taking money you know that.  Hes taking money.
The killer was trying to get to her. That sorority girl was a distraction.
That doesnt work sir.
I wont.
Alright alright...Ill call you back.
Stop it...
Im losing you.
Im inquisitive.
Dont forget to set the alarm.
Look yesterday wasnt my idea. That was all Gale and dollar signs and ratings.
I wish it was just a year. I lost everything because of you. I have nothing now. Look at me this is what Ive become. A long silence. Sidney is hanging on by threads.
What?
Its over Cotton.
Job hazard. Debbie Salt stringer NEWSWEEK. Answer a few questions?
What are you doing here? I thought you had retired from field reporting?
And much richer as a result.
Tons and tons.
Finish what my son started.
Enter Cotton Weary.
Yeah.
Sid you dont have to.
Ill get my jacket.
I think its out of your control.
Its not you Derek. I dont trust myself. I tend to make big selection errors when it comes to men.
So youll relieve me at 230...
I read her postings on the horror movie chat boards and fell hopelessly. Hook line...
Until now.
The way I see it. Well be arrested. Go to prison. Cash in on the home footage. Secure a book deal. If all goes as planned our trial should coincide with the release of STAB II.
And we didnt want to do that Sid. We wanted to give you your moneys worth.
Tuitions expensive.
Im on crowd patrol Miss Weathers excuse me.
I see you read the book.
Page 41. Deputy Dewey oozed with inexperience.
How do you know my dimwitted inexperience isnt merely a subtle form of manipulation used to lower peoples expectations thereby enhancing my ability to effectively maneuver within any given situation?
I think youre all an act.
Meaning?
Solid alibis. He was with Sidney when she was attacked.
What are we looking for?
Dewey you and I would never make it.
Over here.
No wait here.
No. I will not crawl under a rock. This is a fuckedup world and people kill people all the time. Ill just get used to it.
Dont worry...
Its hell week. Im pledging the Deltas.
But I love you. And I want the whole world to know it.
Please I have the perfect excuse.
Ive got my entourage. Take a break. Please.
Id really just like to be alone.
Its not a good idea Hallie.
Her old boyfriend?
Thanks Joel.
But...
..we only promote safe rubbered sex.
Gale?
But...
Im sorry Im sorry but I had to. It was too easy.
Where you going?
Im sorry Sid please. I never should have gone along with Gale. I know Im stupid. I wish I had some good reason to give you but Im just stupid. Please Sid dont be mad at me.
Well yeah...she gave me a job. Freelance. It got me outta Woodsboro. Im sorry about Cotton and yesterday. It was a bad idea. I knew it was a bad idea but it seemed like a quasi harmless bad idea. Ah shit Sid Im fucked up. Sidney looks at him Long and hard a smile slowly appearing.
And that CICI chick wasnt that bad either but Im really concerned about my safety now.
I mean Im standing right outside the LADIES ROOM door at the PLAZA THEATER. Your girlfriend Christine is in there.  Shes all alone. Everyones in the auditorium waiting for the film to start.  Ive got my knife.
Does the name Maureen Prescott sound familiar to you?
Im sorry Miss Weathers. Allow me to introduce myself MARK KINCAID L.A.P.D.  Are you familiar with the actor Ben Damon or the actress CHRISTINE PERKINS?
Both of them were found brutally murdered this morning under the Hollywood sign. Autopsy reports having come back to me yet but the bodies looked like something out one of the Stab films.
Id love to help really I wouldnt mind being sliced at again by a maniacal psychopath but I honestly dont know where Sidney is. After Windsor she dropped off the face of the Earth. The only other person that might know is  not going to talk.
Look Miss Weathers if theres a problem give me a call. Heres my card. Im always there.
Deal but Im still Detective Kincaidok?
But we know who killed Maureen Prescott Billy Loomis and Stu Macher.  I mean they even told Sidney how they did it
To me Hollywood is about death.
I know what its like to see ghosts that dont Go away.  To be watching a scary movie in your head whether you want to or not  watching it alone.
Cant arrest ghosts.  But the best way to stop being haunted is to be with people.  Youre here youre not hiding youve done the right thing Miss Prescott.
Understood.  If youll excuse me Detective.  Gale.
What does this have to do with Sid?
When its a threat youll know it.
What Rielly?
He couldve monitored the calls on a scanner. Did you call her from the set?
And what made you think it was Sidney?
Listen Detective I wanna see this studio where all this shits going down.
Mm what a waste of Silicone.  What does my mother have to do with this all Dewey? Were a long way from Woodsboro.
Yes. Look lets get something straight Dewey I got into this shit cause the police came looking for ME. Not cause Im out to make the SUNRISE STUDIOS SLASHINGS.
And?
Someone stole Sids file?
Amen boy scout now answer the fucking door
Do you want us to come with you?
Roman from your enthusiasm it certainly seems that way.  Honestly though  tell us whatsyour favorite scary movie?
Sure.
What the hell are you doing?
Do you get any of my witty humor? I mean you did play me for three movies.  His two hands dingus.
Yeah.
Im hanging up right now.
SCENE 32. INT. CANDYS LIVING ROOM  NIGHT. What are you talking about Ricky the murders were a completely isolated incident.
Makeup. You need it.  Hey Roman isnt here?
Wwhat do you want?
You sick fuck Im tracing this call as we speak The police are gonna nail your ass
Great. A spirited one. Ill be seeing you real soon Sidney. Real soon.
Who is this?
Yes hi Im Laura Im a trained counselor. How can I help you.
Im sorry your voice.
Piece of cake. Shell be there.
I was hoping Sid and I could talk.
Its an easy game. We ask you a question. If you get it wrong  you die.
Except for me and Billy... we were left for dead...
Yes sir.
Im sorry. Dont hate me.
What are you doing here?
The police say I scared him off. It wasnt me Sid.
Oh Sidney...
Are you serious?
Fuck you.
We did your mom a favor Sid. The woman was a slut bag whore who flashed her shit all over town like she was Sharon Stone or something.
You have to have a favorite.
Guess.
Wait... I thought we were gonna go out.
Dont hang up on me.
I cant think.
Name the killer in FRIDAY THE 13TH.
Answer the question and I will.
I know who you are maam. Hows the eye?
Well... uh... yes maam. For the time being.
You are precious. Please call me Gale.
Mind if I join you?
Id love to. If youre sure its alright?
Oh God Sid Im sorry I was late.
Yes you doofus.
Im sorry Deputy Deweyboy but were ready to go.
Sorry police orders. Ill stay out of the way I promise.
Not yet.
How is everything?
What were you doing out here?
Have to be. The shit shes gone through.
Shell be with her friends over at Stu Makers tonight.
Call the police.
The phones dead.
I can hear her. Oh Mother of God I can hear her.
But its so much easier when we make it up.
Just stay back.
Have you talked to Cotton?
Hes lying. She wouldnt have touched him. He raped her then butchered her. Her blood was all over his coat.
Ricki Lake.
Do you like scary movies Sidney?
Whats your favorite scary movie?
That is so unoriginal. You disappoint me Randy.
Uhhuh.
If you hang up youll die just like your mother.
Who are you?
Sleep tight sweetie.
Twice.
What are you saying? That I killed her or something?
Yeah Im off early  curfew you know.  Now thats poor taste.
Maybe Sidney wouldnt have sex with him.
Could be. Now that Billys tried to mutilate her you think Sid would go out with me?
I can cry on cue.
Ill be right back.
You guys can go up to my parents room? To talk and... whatever.
Why are you doing this?
Do they know who did it?
They think its schoolrelated?
Ill be there by seven. I promise
Her dads out of town. Shes staying with us.
He was there Tatum.
It was him Tatum. I know it.
I dont know...
With Stu theres little time to stop and reflect. But sometimes before to relax and get in the mood I think about Grant Goodeve.
Grant wrote the song himself. Im convinced the lyrics had a secret meaning Eight is enough...
Oh Sidney. WHAT? A guy can talk tits til hes dead but the minute you mention an eight inch weenie. Watch out.
He wouldnt just turn himself in.  It doesnt make any sense.
So what?  This victim...
This cant be my last duty here.  It will go on and on.
Ill get a job maybe on a farm.  Ill work on the house.
I heard.
Hes not finished.
Put it down.  Put it on the ground.
Hello.
Why?
Her pretty head.
Youll see.
Not me.  Im not special.  Im not exceptional.  This is though.  What Im doing.
You know thats not true.
Now... I wouldnt do something like that Johnny.  I like you.  I like you a lot.
You only killed a bunch of innocent people so you could get your rocks off.  Thats all.
And why is that?
Sit back.
All this effort youve made to get transferred its the first question that pops into my head.
Maybe I thought I could do more good here than there.  I dont know.  Look itd be great by me if we didnt start right off kicking each other in the balls.  But youre calling the shots Lieutenant so... however you want it to go.
I made a decision because I have to consider the integrity of the scene.  I cant worry whether you think youre getting enough time on the playing field.
Can we talk about this in private?
Detective Mills here.  Honey... I asked you not to call me here. Ill call you back...  What?  Why?
Im invited to have a late supper at your house.  And I accept.
I vaguely recall a large angry man and someone called Norton.
All day Saturday and all day Sunday.  The murderer would want Gould to take his time.  To have to sit there and decide. Where do you make the first cut?  Theres a gun in your face... but what part of your body is expendable?
Nothing.
A switchblade.
It doesnt fit.  He doesnt want us to help him stop.
Oh thats all.
Doesnt seem like our man does it?
Never took a bullet.  I pulled my gun once. fired it once.
Sounds like he knew what he was talking about.
No kidding  No fucking kidding
No.
No.  Hes not depending on luck.  Youve seen that.  We walked into that apartment exactly one year after he first tied Victor to the bed to the day.  To the day Because he wanted us to.
Just because the bastard has a library card it doesnt make him Einstein.
What does all that matter anyway?  Its not our job to figure him out is it?  All we have to do is catching him.
How is this legal?
Yeah well... at least were out of the office.  Weve got pizza.
Were focusing.
The Divine Comedy.  A History of Catholicism.  A book called Murderers and Madmen.
It was him.
What the fuck is wrong with you?
No point in arguing anymore...
These murders are his masterwork.  His sermon to all of us.  To all us sinners.
Youre the oldest man I know Somerset.
You do your job...
You follow the law and do the best you can. Its all there.
It wasnt one thing if thats what you mean.  I just... I cant live here anymore. I cant live where stupidity is embraced and nurtured as if it were a virtue.
Wrong  I sympathize completely because if you cant win... then if you dont ignore everything and everyone around you you... you become like John Doe.  Its easier to beat a child than it is to raise it because it takes so much work to love.  You just have to make sure you dont stop to think about the abuse and the damage because youll risk being sad.  Keep ignoring.
That part of me is dead.
No actually I wasnt sure at all.
When do we get to question him?
You and I are probably for the first time ever in total agreement.  He wouldnt just stop.
Hes only two murders away from finishing his masterpiece right?  Can you even conceive of whats going to happen next?  I mean can you even imagine how hell try to finish it?
I will.
What are you talking about?  What happened?
I cant let you do this...
I... I dont understand.
I dont see anything.
I cant do this now... please.
It surprises me.  It really does.
You have to put blinders on sometimes. Most times.
Talk to him about it.  Hell understand if you tell him how you feel.
You should look into private schools.
I hate this city.
Crime of passion.
Its not a sword ma...Its a sabre  Did you kill many damYankees with this sabre Uncle Ethan?
Stealing the cattle was just to pull us out...This heres a murder raid...  It shapes up to scald out either your place...or my brothers.

Mrs. Torrance most of the time these episodes with kids are never explained.  They are brought on by emotional factors and they rarely occur again.
Well how can I repay you?
Yes sir.
And er... where are they now?
A nigger.
Your son has a very great talent. I dont think you are aware how great it is but he is attempting to use that very talent against your will.
Grady... oh.
Your wife appears to be stronger than we imagined Mr. Torrance. Somewhat more resourceful she seems to have got the better of you.
Thank you very much.  Ill do that.
Hallo this is Dick Halloran again. I called a while ago about the folks at the Overlook Hotel.
Oh thats just great.  How do you folks like our hotel so far?
It will be a pleasure.  Right this way Mrs. Torrance.
Doc.  You called Danny Doc twice just now.
Things could be better Lloyd. Things could be a whole lot better.
I love it.  I really do.  Ive never been this happy or comfortable anywhere.
Yes.
Yes.
I dont think thats true.  I think you have some very definite ideas about what should be done with Danny... and Id like to know what they are.
When do you think maybe he should be taken to a doctor?
Im not going to hurt you.
Stop swinging the bat.
Put the bat down Wendy.
Give me the bat.
Go away.
Wendy...
Do you mind if I ask why you do that?  It seems to me that the skiing up here would be fantastic.
Well...
Well that sounds fine to me.
Theyll love it.
Well my predecessor in this job
shut in together over long periods of time.
put off by the idea of staying alone in a place where something like that actually happened.
Well its very... homely.
Oh well he sure did a beautiful job. Pink and gold are my favorite colors.
I dont accept the idea that he knows who his letter writer is Jane. Because I dont accept the idea that there was a big bad wolf who saw Marty in his wheelchair.
I dont know. Maybe he doesnt know either.
Sure Uncle Al.
If you dont stop it Im going to vomit. I mean it.
Jane I have to talk to you.
Will you?
All except my legs... I dont think I can walk.
What kind of noises?
No.
A bunch of men getting ready to pretend theyre Clint Eastwood... Marty didnt anybody ever tell you that the only monsters are in comic books and drivein movies?
Ill give you the telephone numbers of my exwives dear boy theyll be interested to hear that.
But you are you know you are my dear boy.
She and dad are out back lighting the barbecue. Janes walking around like shes King Shit of Turd Mountain. Like always.
I dont get you.
Sure.
Yeah I know. Its great
What the hell does that matter?
Watch it dear boy. I think it was a hallucination. Probably a broomstick or something.
I didnt shoot him when he was a man. I shot him when he was
I told you
What about Father Lowe chasing me in his car and trying to run me down? You dont think that was a dream do you?
Marty the moon wasnt even full
Dear boy you have gone right out of your mind.
Really?
LET THY THOUGHTS BE GUIDED
LET THY SOUL BE HEALED

Hey Sisters.  Are you going in there?
What did who say?
You did what?
You want me to go against a priest?  Get excommunicated?  You think Im nuts?
You lying sleazeball  The best years of my life  What am I garbage?  Am I lint?
That used to be true Vince.  I was with you.  But something happened.  And Im different now.  Realdifferent.  Ive had well you might call it  a religious experience.  And Ive got just two words for you.  And those two words are...
Ohhuh.
Oh my 
Yes Betty?
D00LANG DOOLANG D00LANG.
But dont you get money?  From the Vatican?
Mary Clarence could you?  Mary Lazarus youre terrific but...  Could you help us?
No way.  Were a choir right? Headliners.  The big room.  Two days a week wont cut it.  Every day.
So use it.  When we sing hymns theyre usually about rejoicing right? Celebration.  Most music is.  So dont hold back.  Let all that joy go right into your voice.  Make me happy.  Let me hear it.  Perk out.  Perk down.
That man  who is he?
Get moving.  Im right behind you.
What a shame
Whatever.
Thats true wouldnt that be great.  Of course we never know when things are going to change.  Any one of us could be transferred to another convent tomorrow.
Sing
Three years.  Sister.
Its part of St. Katherines new community outreach program.  How old are you?  You shouldnt be smoking.  Have you ever seen a diseased lung?  Hand em over.
You watch yourself
Good point.  Especially that dude you were with.  Id like to see him down front.
Experience
Give me a C.  A C
Oh no.  Well always be together.
Again?
Shes got nothing to do with this.  Let her go.
What did He say?
Enough joking.
Parochial school.  Akron.  St. Androids.
Are you talking about me?
You mean black people?
Would you like that?
Can do.
Normally dressed you are a sore thumb and you endanger us all.  While you are here you will conduct yourself as a nun. Only I shall know who and what you truly are.  You will not disrupt the convent.  You will not influence the Sisters with your colorful street talk. You will draw no attention to yourself in any way.
No problem.
Silence?  No talking?  All day?
From all Ive heard just about everything.  Your singing career seems all but nonexistent and your married lover wants you dead. 
Mary Clarence
You are correct.  Sometimes prayer alone cannot help a situation.  Such as your own for example.  How do you feel about physical labor?
Do your recall the words of Saint Peter in Ecciesiastes 127?  He spoke unto a wastrel youth.  He said Take up thy task and know ye the path of contentment.
But you cant kick me out  Guys want to kill me  Youre a nun  A big nun Arent you supposed to have compassion? For the wayward sheep?  I mean Im a major sinner  Alltime great  Hall of Fame  Arent I like your dream come true?  Your Olympic event?
What do you mean?
I believe this can be settled by a simple vote.
You have a phone call.
I have submitted my resignation to Bishop OHara.  Privately.  I have asked to be relocated as soon as possible.
Indeed.  After how long?  A few weeks? I have been here thirty years.  And yet it would seem I know nothing.
Im a Christian.
Cause youre always out arresting people.  Making trouble.  I dont know why I went out with you in the first place it was embarrassing  I couldnt hold my head up I used to tell people you were a security guard
A what? When are you qonna wake up?
Information baby.  I thought maybe somebody around here might have a conscience.
You couldnt believe it?  Vince the Prince?
Thenyou run.
Youd lose.  Youd die.  All over the sidewalk.  And into the street.
Get a stenographer.
Not again.  You cant keep calling. Somebodys going to catch on to where you are.
Youre supposed to be hiding out
Ive been worried about you.
No.  Most of the time Im thinking about you.  And now... youve really changed.
You re sort of... radiant.   your eyes are shining.  Youre rea1ly different...
What?
You dont get it  Its a big thing for them its like... Caesars Palace. Primetime.  Theyre singing for the Cardinals.  Its like... Star Search. If first prize was a trip to the Vatican. Theyve worked really hard they deserve this.
Ohhuh.
You wont even tell us?
You found him  but were not open yet.
Which one
Willy  hit the lights.
Where is she?
That should have tipped us.
Reverend Mother on behalf of the sisters Id like to welcome Mary Clarence to St. Katherines.
However we can also pray for other things.
Its better than ice cream.
Shes our inspiration
And therefore an ideal prospect for rehabilitation.
St. Katherines is a Benedictine Order. You have taken a Vow of Hospitality.  To all in need.
And youll face that danger headon.  As if I could stop you.  And you have my complete support in this matter. Anything you can do to revitalize this neighborhood would be a blessing.
Sarah has gone missing... my servant girl.  Her things are gone.  Damn it. She has joined the migration out of town.  What about breakfast woman?  Or am I to starve to death?
What are you spying on?
Bring him.
I cannot proceed without examining the previous victims.
No.  You will not run me out.  No one will believe a word of what you say.
I am the Lords voice in this town.
You cannot do this.  I am a man of God
When a goblin leaps from the nether world others follow.  Poltergeists of the air water and earth follow and cheer his desecrations
No you listen  You may think we are a pack of superstitious dullards...
Up.
What kind of nuts?
Now hold the bowl steady.  Back to business.
Father said witches live there.
And it now belongs to you according to Baltus.  I heard him say it.
Baltus Van Tassel.
There are none for Magistrate Philipse either.  Paasch James Pieter Thomas Pos William.
Lady Van Tassel.
Something I really wish I had not seen. Never mind it.  Did you find the victims loan agreements?
It is nothing.  She comes to read books so her father will not find her.  It is absolutely nothing.
Things have become complicated. Katrina is at the mill.  Ride ahead find her and bring her to meet me outside the church.  Find her at all costs.  Quickly.
I need time for thinking.  Without you hanging on my coattails for a change.
Take me with you.  Theres nothing left for me here.
I doubt thats the end.
Feel free to form your own opinion.  Though it appears you already have.
Which may explain his temperament. To have asked twice means the answer was no at least once.
Extra ordinary yes.  But first you tell me about the Headless Horseman.
There is no such thing as magic.
May I ask... why do you cover your book that way?
You made this and the drawings?
That would be a pity.  Those words might show you something youve never seen before.
If these are the random stalkings of a monster what good am I?
No stone may be left unturned.  It may appear harsh...
You are not regarding it in full. The Widow Windsor had been run through by a sword.  I followed the bloodless wound a wound whose path I could not comprehend till I had seen the Horseman with my own eyes.
If it had been surgery on a living person done to save that persons life you would not question it.  Not for a moment.  So let me be the first to tell you dear girl... on the other side of these sheltering mountains a whole world has advanced beyond such plebeian thinking as yours.  And someday no matter how much you fear it that world will come to roust Sleepy Hollow out of its slumber.
She died.  Her lungs were diseased... two years ago.  What is this about?
He... he tries to take the heads... they will not pass.
Keep climbing.  I will follow...
I can show exactly.
No one will believe your lies whore.
May I see my mother?
No sir please... she is innocent...
Wait up Ill leave with you and lock up.
See there. Thinks of the simplest thing first.
Good to see you Bill. Hows everybody doin?
What do you like to eat here?
They was a boy. We made friends.
Aint that the sweetest thing. What am I supposed to do about supper with you traipsin around with that fag?
See you made him somethin. Hey Vaughan I was just goin on with you jokin around buddy.
I just feel sorry for the poor thing.
This is not your house Doyle. This is my house and Ill say who stays and goes. Youve got a house why dont you go get one of your girlfriends and go home to it.
Dont tell me what to do.
What do you want hun?
I get nervous thats all I know.
Karl can stay if he wants to. Mama said 
Shhhh This is the national anthem.
This and that. Toothpaste and whatnot.
How does a feller go about gettin ahold of the police?
I wanted to bring you some flowers. Theyre pretty good ones.
Im closing the door now. I told you Ill see you later.
I killed some folks quite awhile back. They said I wadnt right in the head and they put me in there in the nervous hospital instead of puttin me in jail.
I never was much count at it. I never did get picked out fer it.
I was kindly needin to do some tradin. Reckon they sell toothpaste?
You ort not to talk that way. Youre just a boy.
That gal that made employee of the month give em to me for awalkin with her.
All right then.
All right then.
If you want me to.
He aint no count.
Naw.
My daddy come to the shed out back and got me and said throw this here away and handed me a towel with somethin in it. I went for the trash barrel there and opened up the towel to see cause they was a noise and somethin movin in it. Hit was bloodylike around that towel. Hit was a little ol bitty baby no bigger than a squirrel.
A little ol boy.
I didnt feel right about doin that. I takened a shoe box from there in the shed and emptied out some screwdrivers and nuts and warshers from it and put the little feller in that and buried him in the corner of the yard there. That seemed more proper to me I reckon.
Hits been hard thinkin about it. They aint a day goes by I dont think about it. I kindly have a picture of it up in my head that I see. Hit makes me sad too. I have bad thoughts on it. I wished they was somethin I could of did too. Shouldnt no bad things happen to childern. All the ol bad things ort to be saved up for folks thats growed up the way I see it. I shouldnt of told you about that. A boy ort not hear about such things. It just kindly come out.
Yes sir I reckon it does.
I dont reckon I know. I aint found no way yet and Im three or four times as old as you. Might be thats just the way folks is.
I dern near had me a touchdown till them boys got ahold of me there so I figured I better give it off to you. I seen you over there follerin me.
Yes maam. I like a fried chicken leg.
You dont want to give away all your books.
Frank told me about your situation. And Frank loves company. You know especially after his daddy passed and all. There aint no sense in you stayin in that old greasy shop.  Hes mentally retarded poor thing.
Doyle wouldnt really kill you would he?
I reckon.
Me too.
I aint got no boy.
You better go get your things.
Naw.
Yes sir.
My history.
That boy hes my friend. He likes the way I talk and I like the way he talks.
No maam.
Its all right.  You know I was thinkin theres this girl that works with me. Shes real heavy but shes cute in the face. Well you know shes slow. Shes a little bit I think. Shes not retarded just  it dont matter listen to me. I thought you might like to meet her. Vaughan wants to have a little supper over at his house and we could invite her. Would you like that?
Yes maam.  I like your garage.  I wouldnt never hurt you or your boy. Id lay my hand on the Bible and say the same thing.
I could shore use some. Thank ye.
Youre a good mama to that boy. You care for him. You work hard fer him to take care of him. You light him up in his eyes Ive seen it. He wouldnt know what to do without ye.
Youve been real good to me too. It aint everbody thatd make biscuits in the middle of the night. You and that boy has give me a good feelin.
I reckon Mr. Woolridge got me hired on to work for Bill Coxs outfit.
Not really to speak of.
So youre really going to stay here?
I know.
Signs?
I think everybody at the store knows that already. They always talk about it. Maureen Ledbetter told a awful story about why you aint allowed over at the First Baptist Church no more.
I wouldnt actually call it a party. Its more along the lines of a dinner in celebration of my birthday.  The guest list is quite restricted. So far theres Mr. Benjamin and myself. If you accept that would make three of us.
Better make it charge. 
I confess.
Muncie Indiana. He and my mother met as students. But Im from Brooklyn. My sisters and I were all born and bred right here.
Visions of Utopia in NineteenthCentury American Fiction.
Which explains why this hasnt been the easiest summer of my life.
Yeah well Ive sort of been out of commission.  Hows Melville?
For me?  Ill have the same thing. 
Whats that Sol?
Whats the difference?
Uh sure Sol. Anything you say. Instead of saying One corned beef sandwich and then Another corned beef sandwich Ill say Two corned beef sandwiches.
You run out of Schimmelpennincks?
Yeah I did.
Well lets not exaggerate. I take pictures. You line up what you want in the viewfinder and click the shutter. No need to mess around with all that artisto crap.
It can be arranged. Seeing as how Ive read your books. I dont see why I shouldnt share my pictures with you.  It would be an honor.
Its my project. What youd call my lifes work.
Hes crazy.
Wed better be. I havent spent a night out of Brooklyn in fourteen years and Im not about to break my record now. Besides Ive got to be on my corner at eight sharp tomorrow morning.
Hi Auggie.
Uh better make it one.
Yeah I know but Im trying to cut down.  Somebodys worried about my health.
Take over the register while Im gone okay Jimmy? 
Okay.  You remember how you once asked me how I started taking pictures? Well this is the story of how I got my first camera. As a matter of fact its the only camera Ive ever had. Are you following me so far?
I guess so. I never thought of it that way.
Anything for art eh Paul?
I mean its a good story.
Exactly. Life just wouldnt be worth living would it?
I dont want to talk about it.  If you really want to know. I lost it. And Im not sorry I did. That eye was cursed Auggie and it never gave me nothing but grief.
Dont look at me like that. Auggie. It gives me the creeps.
Dont rush me okay? Youre jumping to conclusions before Ive even said anything.  And besides its not for me.  Its for our daughter.
Her name is Felicity and she just turned eighteen.  She ran away from Pittsburgh last year and now shes living in some shithole here in Brooklyn with a guy named Chico. Strung out on crack four months pregnant.  I cant bear to think about that baby. Our grandchild Auggie. Just think of it. Our grandchild.
It means happiness.
It fizzled baby. Thats the way it goes. But we had our times didnt we? It wasnt all bad.
And thats how Felicity came into the picture. During one of those two seconds.
Yeah? And what else am I supposed to do? Theres no baby anymore and if she wants to throw away her life thats her business.
Bully for you.
Why dont you open it and find out?
For keeps.
I try not to anyway. Its better for your health. I mean look at you Vincent. Youre the guy with the wife and three kids and the ranch house on Long Island. Youre the guy with the white shoes and the white Caddy and the white shag carpet. But youve had two heart attacks and Im still waiting for my first.
Okay my man. Love to the wife and kids et cetera et cetera. Drop me a postcard if you can remember the address.
This way gentlemen. Lets retire to my office shall we?
What is this some kind of joke?
Youre a dumb whackedout little fuck do you know that?
Look lady thats enough. If you dont calm down. Im going to throw you out. Do you hear me? Right now
Im not going to rob you mister.  Do I look like a thief?
Is there a benefits package or are you hiring me on a freelance basis?
You know health insurance dental plan paid vacation. Its not fun being exploited. Workers have to stand up for their rights.
An ugly piece of hardware isnt it?  Ill tell you what happened to my arm.  Ill tell you what happened.  Twelve years ago God looked down on me and said Cyrus youre a bad stupid selfish man. First of all Im going to fill your body with spirits and then Im going to put you behind the wheel of a car and then Im going to make you crash that car and kill the woman who loves you. But you Cyrus Im going to let you live because living is a lot worse than death. And just so you dont forget what you did to that poor girl Im going to rip off your arm and replace it with a hook. If I wanted to I could rip off both your arms and both your legs but Im going to be merciful and just take off your left arm. Every time you look at your hook I want you to remember what a bad stupid selfish man you are. Let that be a lesson to you Cyrus a warning to mend your ways.
That boys one in a million. A real tiger.
Louisa Vail. Remember her Cyrus?
I dont got no daddy you dig? I got born last week when some dog fucked you up the ass.
Come on. At least let me buy you a cup of coffee.
In Manhattan?
Then what are you doing in Park Slope? Its a little far from home isnt it?
Nice drawing. Did you do that?
Is your father an artist?
Yeah sometimes.  I like to dabble too.
Im sorry. They just... they just slipped out of my hands.
No hard feelings okay? Its a small place and I cant get my work done with you around.
Do you need some money? Some extra clothes?
Take good care of yourself okay?
Business appointment. Im seeing my broker at three oclock.
Fair enough. We wouldnt want to get carried away would we?  Now call your aunt Em and let her know youre alive.
Its my birthday. Im seventeen years old  as of fortyseven minutes ago and I think I should celebrate having made it this far.
I just did.
Absolutely. We would be honored.
Thats just it. I didnt think. I just did it.
Thats it. In a nutshell.
That money is my whole future.
It was more complicated than that. There was a reason.
He was out five thousand bucks he said.... He kept saying it over and over.... Five thousand bucks down the drain.... He wouldnt stop.... Five thousand bucks five thousand bucks.... He was like out of his mind with those five thousand bucks....
Good. Im glad thats settled
Its all right. I really do know them.
Now ask him who his mother was.
You dont.
Their kids was born here.  So when the oldest that one there was twenty...last payment gets made and he could own it.
Its a joke.  Maneuver up to Carls boat?  Tie your lines fast?  Come aboard?  All against Carls will? Its the stupidest suggestion I ever heard of.
Couldnt get on the boat.  Id just ushootu the feller.  uThenu tie up throw him inta th drink.  And skip bein the first gillnetter in history to make a successful forced boarding.
No sense to have uanyu at all. even the right size.  Its like having an extra battery in the trunk of your car.  Nobody does.
All right what if the defendant uheardu?  So Carl uletu him aboard to help.  And uthenu the fishing gaff?
Well what if?
Your husband returned at what seven oclock?
But if truth was on your side whatever were you worried about?
I lie to my parents every day. And every night.
Itll be over soon.  I can get you money.
Im sorry about your arm.  Kabuo and I.  Are very sor...
Those arent the facts that matter.
What else?  I had the boy teach me kendo.  Including...the importance of the bow.
Nossir.  Id gone to tell the wid... to tell Mrs. Heine.
Pretty darn clear.
I said that if I was playing Sherlock Holmes...Id maybe look for a... Japanese person.  With a bloody gun butt.  A righthanded fella to be precise.
My expertise.  Is that Im a journalist.
He didnt want to lose any more.
Thats how journalists.  Answer questions.
Thats curious.  I was uappealingu to their intelligence.
Oh yeh.  But this is nine year ago I had my healt I wasnt wantin to sell.
Actually she said you had decided. Decided unotu not come forward.
I slept til onethirty when my wife woke me up with the news.  We talked for a few hours.  I left at six and went straight to my boat.
Yes.
Three kids.  Whats she going to do?
Wont take two.
To my father.  Everything counts.
Fell.
Just as the freighter comes through? Isnt that quite a coincidence?
But you ucouldu be wrong.  He ucouldu have climbed up earlier.
The knife.  What knife?
Ill take two.  One for later.
Look no way Im lettin you out there.  In a half hour you could be in Canada.
Youre wonderin...how come I never ask.  If you did it.
Two D6s.  Thats the kind his well was fitted for.
Apparently.
Possible.  But not darn likely.
Your report says death by udrowningu which means he went into the water alive and breathing.  And the report is accurate...?
But you are ucertainu that he died by drowning.
Yes you can tell me about the minor cut you found on the deceaseds right hand.  The report says recent origin.  How recent?  As much as 24 hours before death?
Such as?
Bye.
Get lost will you?
All right girls  from the top again.

William Morris
There are two things I will not put up with during working hours.  One is liquor  and the other one is men.
Where did he conduct?
No just dumb.  If I had any brains I wouldnt be on this crummy train with this crummy girls band.
You see I have this thing about saxophone players.
Every time
But youre a girl thank goodness.
So you pull yourself together and you go on to the next job and the next saxophone player and its the same thing all over again.  See what I mean?  not very bright.
Whats in Florida?
Well now that youve mentioned it 
Bienstock.  He snores to beat the band. We cut cards to see who sleeps over him and I always lose.  Wouldnt you know?
Good night Sugar.

Eight hundred and fifty thousand dollars.
From a rich millionaire.
Quite a while.  As a matter of fact Im not coming back at all.
According to our tax advisers shes only soso.  But  thats the way the oil gushes. A man in my position has a certain responsibility to the stockholders  all those little people who invest their life savings 
Not always.  But I want you to know Im very grateful for what you did for me.
Thats right  pour it on.  Talk me out of it.

Big joke

Did Amy tell you she keeps her Homecoming tiara by the bed?
Bacardi 151.
What? Why? What do you mean?
What for?
Actually I do.
I knew you were still seeing someone else when we finally got together. I never in a million years would have dreamt it was Jeffrey.
Why with you.
I was pretty hard on her last night.  And now shes getting married.
Mom please.
I figured you could pick up your car tomorrow.
No.
Oh yes. Right. The Rat and Parrot.
Let me guess. Amy presumed Id forget the rings.  I think Im her least favorite person.  You know I am sorry.
I shagged Amy. Two years ago. Thats why I ended it. And then after you left sod it we kept at it like rabbits until we both realized it was absolutely mad. And you know morally wrong. Then there was that one other time. And that was it.
I dont know.
On the nose.  I tell you what because youre so cute Ill take care of our incidentals.
Graham Russell and Russell Hitchcock.
Thats right. Imagine facing it alone.
Shampoo got it
What?
I disappear. Its not about me.
Of course not. How...how could it be? Nothing happened.
Its my job.
I didnt say he was worth it.
Go ahead Kat. Hate me. You were running out of steam on the whole Jeffrey thing. Maybe now youll be able to hold onto this just long enough to ruin your next relationship.
Hi.
You knew?
Give it back? Are you nuts?
Its complicated Dad.
...but its getting there. 
Close. Sydney. Turns out I missed the rain.
and The ass of The man who adores her.

Wake up people  We all have to do things that arent pretty sometimes Its the not pretty things that make life worth fighting the not pretty things for Why do you think children have to be born in hospitals?
As Commander in chief I have ordered our Army to set up defensive positions along the USCanada border in anticipation of an attack.
Well find out where that signal is coming from  Then hunt them down like dogs Any and all Canadian influence must be stopped at all cost
Oh no you dont This is MY fight I dont need your help Alan Dershwitz
Oh.
Well it looks like Ill have to send a warning letter out to parents. I have to put a stop to this before MORE children see Terrance and Phillip.
Well some of the children just dont respond to 12 step programs.
I dont care if its dangerous Desperate times call for desperate measures Mr. Mackey. Perhaps I need to remind you of your situation.
Well lets see... First of all you fuck pigs.
My mother sent YOU a letter? Whats it say?

The young boy that died lit himself on fire. It was unfortunate but how can they blame US?

God damn it why does she keep saying that?
And the butfor?
Hes shutting off the air
It cant be.
Of course of course...
Well I guess were neighbors for this trip.
Very professional of you.
I was there.  Officer Taylor accessed my CPU directly to open the airlock doors.  They are not functioning properly.
Well its a good thing that I did.
Trust me.  Even checked em with my own eyes.
Aint it the truth. The two say nothing for a beat 
Its steady good benefits.
Well maybe Ill surprise you.
Transmit the code 3 emergency and take us offline.  Override the airlock sensors and hurry  Were running out of time we have to get to the pods
You better start making sense
We have the codes here.  How do you want to receive them?
Sure you do.  Sending Mac out on a little recon work.  How pathetic.  Problem is it seems Mac blew a few fuses.  Or maybe hes just a little drunk. Were you partying with a robot Taylor?
Thats clear.
Sheesh  Aye aye capn
Yeah I guess money dont buy class.
Like that piece of ass he was with.
Not me.  Im in for the long haul. In nine months Ill have enough to take a few years off.
Will you shut up already?
Thats right.
Yes.  Theoretical discoveries aside theres nothing like the real thing. How about you?
Suppose you didnt have to hold your breath?
Close every door behind you
Dont worry about me.  Where are we going?
One of Barnes duds luckily for us.  Take this out of the equation right now...
Sure.
Helllp
A flare?  A flare wont do it.
Im going to try and buy you some time.  I can get to the bridge from here.
Im about to blow the wall.
We have room  Lets go
We dont have time.  Ill explain later hurry
And so far.
Good.  In that case I pronounce us man and wife.
Well theres no better to way to see the world than with us.
Well if you need anything please feel free to ask me.  Just a reminder we have fabulous cuisine available 24 hours in the earthrise room and a large selection of vintage wines here in our ship bar.
Hes up on the bridge  Hes going to be OK.  Now whos missing?
Look you were the one who wanted to do something different something to tell all your friends.  Any chump can go to Nassau.
How am I supposed to know?
Talk to him...Jesus...
That will not be necessary.  You can simply speak to me.  I understand most languages fluently.
Alteration of my central processing unit should be done only by an authorized service dealer.
I would recommend a maintenance crew in this sector.
You afraid were gonna steal it?
How could you hate opera Sid? Opera has all the drama and excitement of real life  to music
It was a clearance.
Only problem is you didnt put his lights out you just got him mad. Then he took it out on poor Faz God rest his soul. Theo patches out.
Nectar of the bowling gods Faz.
Weve been partners a long time now havent we Buzz?
Simple math Buzz.  Two plus two does not equal three.
Im sure you have Buzz.
They suspended me for 100 years.
I need a sponsor to get my sanction card back. Where I come from youre the king.
Its mine.
Whats it look like to you?
Dont say that about my mom
I am underground.
I told you to get lost. You forced yourself into this mess so the mess accommodated you. Buzz straightens out and carefully remolds the bent out of shape halo.
Bowling died for me years ago. Besides Im a living dead legend. Im a hero.
See ya round Maynard.
Clam it
Hes not the guy Millie. Just whip the whips.
Do you have to get your hooks into every guy Im interested in?
SHEILA
Someone wants to play with me?
If Junior thinks youre doing the bouncy bouncy with his sister hes gonna tap dance on your spleen. 
No
You know who I am?
What ever happened to just bowling?
He killed your stoolie embezzler father and hes gonna kill you next Sid and Breeze push him towards the van as the crowds MURMUR increases. Kastle turns and yells over his shoulder.
He stuck it in the ball return machine when he was a kid. Crushed all the nerve endings. Junior starts stroking the ketchup bottle with his dead hand.
Bowling Center
She hit it Mr. Kastle
Yippy
Its a vicious cycle.
The ladies in Akron call them thigh ticklers.
Id rather you didnt.
Not while Im in training.
Nobody in this town really understands Junior. When I went to family sessions for him I realized he was the sanest one in the family. Actually hes the only one in this whole fucking town who knows exactly who he is and what he wants.
So what about you?
Well get into that later.
No Im fascinated.
Well that was plan A.
Plan B is your dad.
He asked me to keep an eye on you for a couple of days.
Whats plan C?
Its been awhile. She didnt want me looking for my dad.
I could let them go for ten.
If you want a professional man you have to be willing to pay for him.
Why should I help that old fuck.
You got any broken bones?
Are you fucking with me Sheila? Is something gonna happen to Buzz? Sheila seems to be trying to tell Theo but is unable.
Why not?
Tell me Sheila. What are you afraid of? Sheila shakes her head.
Did you  kill him?
I killed him once Ill just have to kill him again.
Im looking for somebody.
We provide some extracurricular activities for the senior citizens in the community.
Tell your little pal to let go.
Dwarf bowlings illegal.
Ow Ooh No please Doc said Id be back on the planks in a week Show him Breeze Breeze pulls a copy of New York Bowler from his pocket. The headline reads RUB OUTBOWLING LEGEND KACKED BY DWARFSCAM KINGPIN with a photo of Buzz Fazeli.
Calm down Dr. Levine.
Please Dr. Levine.
I cant see...
Of what were able to measure roughly twentysix hundred feet.
Basic English?  Theres no way this spacecraft was constructed on our planet.
Forty yards.
What are you saying  we cant stop whats out there?
Do it Norman its the only choice we have.  This thing is gonna crush us.
Now
Dont thank me Dr. Johnson.  You werent my choice.  The Pentagon made me take you.
Survivors?  No I wouldnt think so.
Something like that.  That doesnt surprise you?
 Wait a second 
ULF report?  Nobodys mentioned that in years.  You mean someone actually read it?
But sir I dont understand.  This report  these recommendations... theyre for an encounter with extra terrestrial life.
You knowingly recommended a woman with suicidal tendencies for a government operation 
If something should happen to us the Navy will at least have partial records of what happened.
Yes I do.  Whatevers out there I think is his response to us refusing to talk to him earlier.
You see the lever on the green box? Upper right hand corner?
Thank you I can see that.  Try something else.
Nothing.  I dont know.  Everything was normal.  No changes at all.
Harry?  Can you copy?
What the hell is going on here?
In a minute sir.
What?
Ted seems to have some ideas.
The what?
Were all very proud of you Harry but what the hell is it?
Whats the message?
Hes saying Take me to your leader. He wants to know whos in charge.
Radiation shield you think?
What do you make of this?
What would we be working on in the future that would make us want to come back?
To what?
Whats inside the sphere.
The sensors are picking up something outside.
What was Edmunds doing outside?
We cant go down there.  Were not prepared.  That deep?  That takes years of training Beth.  Were just scientists.  Lab scietists.  We wear ties and lab coats to work  not oxygen tanks.
The library.
What about you?  What happened to you?
Normally Id say no.  Everythings quiet now  no ships no divers no electricity.  Makes sense.  But whats curious is  these arent normal jellyfish.
What?
Yeah why?
Where did you get this?
What?
Its also our only way out of here It holds three people.  And theres only three of us left now.
You dont trust me?
I cant see anything.  How does it look?  Still clear?
What are you doing in the ship?  Beth?
Did you look?  It was on the top shelf.
You think?
What?
But how?
How can the sphere do that?
Must be.  And if it is  its a part of him not even he can control.
Something for burns.
Bingo.
Antibiotic.
Causes sleep.
Your watch.
You think Id really drink that?
You put explosives around the habitat I cant imagine what youd put in a drink.
Snakes?  What do you mean exactly?
You tell me.
Whats the phrase  keeping up with the Joneses?
No he isnt.
Am I lying?  Are you sure?  Are you absolutely sure Im lying?  Then explain to me about the jellyfish.  Earlier.  Why did we see jellyfish?  Harry doesnt fear jellyfish.  You do.  Theyre your fear arent they?
Dont fuck with me Beth.
Youre frightened arent you Norman?
Stop what?  Dont blame me.  Its not me.
Leave me alone Norman.
Beth  gimme the gun.
Hear what?
Down below Harry said we would all have to die.  Since there was no evidence on that spacecraft that anybody knew time travel through a black hole was possible  and we all knew  then we would all have to die before we could tell anyone. Death was the only logical explanation.  But sitting here we still know.  So how is that possible?  Unless we make ourselves forget.
Who says its a he?
All that banging and pounding.  I dont know.  We should think about making a good first impression.
We never even had a conversation Norman.
Yeah I dont know how you could make that confusion.
In time for what?
Minutes ago.  Harrys trying to decode it in his room now.
What?
Look would you 
Whatever I can do to help.
Gimme another explanation.
Am I?
Dont do this.  Dont psychoanalyze me.  I hate squid.  Period.  Just like you hate jellyfish.
I cant breathe...  Am I... clear?
I thought she was with you.
You know what it is Harry.
Help me lift her.
Are you trying damn it?  Just 
Hurry Norman.  Four minutes.
Wait
We all kill ourselves?  Bad joke.  Sorry Beth.
You mean forget?
Its not a discharge.  Right Edmunds?  You said before right?  So its gotta be a message.
Its like showing Leonardo da Vinci a laptop computer.  Hed run screaming witchcraft.  And you couldnt explain it to him either. Modems microchips particle physics.
Does this mean what I think it means?
What report?
Told me what?
You mean a picture?
Of course he did.  Hes been isloated for 400 years.  He wants someone to talk to.  Look you put a human being in isolation for four days they can become neurotic sometimes psychotic.  Were talking about 400 years here.  An alien that shows emotional responses.  I think we need to address him before he reacts further.
He didnt say much at all.  Honey 
Im beginning not to like you.
I know that.
You could put it that way.
But you must  I cant do it alone. Im not at all like my father.  Id never make it.
But youre still a powerful Jedi. You dont need my help.
Dont you have a Kiber crystal?
Yes... the Force... something horrible has happened.  I couldnt see what it was or where it was but it was terrible... terrible beyond description... the cry of millions dying at once.
Stop thinking and start feeling. Let yourself go.
I dont get it but I guess I did block it.
You look great  The uniform and everything
But there was a lot of firing earlier...
Ill make a report later.
Whats that little droid carrying thats so blasted important?
We captured the plans in a raid on the Imperial shipyards but we fell under attack before I could get the data to safety so I hid it in this Artoo unit and sent him off.
Id like to get paid before that eventually.  I dont plan to stick around for the fireworks.
Thats pretty steep.  Wed like to talk it over first.
Maybe the fact that no one would go there voluntarily could help us. They probably dont think anyone would dare try.
Lets try this way  Holy Maker.
No he smells something... but we havent time to worry about it now.
They must be shielded somehow.  Im sure the base is there.
Thanks old buddy.  Ill be with you in a second.
Who is this?  Whats your operating...
You used my savings  You stole my savings.  If my father were here...
Thank you sir.  Im See Threepio Human Cyborg relations and this is my counterpart Artoo Detoo.
Send feedback into the control sensors in that Detention block.
It isnt about rich... Its about whos best...

It will... take me from UyouU...
They reach final position in... Twentyseven minutes  mark.
Mr. Scott... on my next signal.
No Admiral. I dont think you are not one damned bit. I remember when you recommended me for this command. You told me how envious you were and if only you could find a way to get a starship command again. Well sir it looks like you found a way.
Permission to speak freely sir?
How do you define UunwarrantedU UmisterU?
Its taken control of the computer...
Im afraid our hand is pretty weak Captain.  But its the only game in town.
This served the purpose.
It seems we UallU imagine God in our own image.
I would never take advantage of a sexually immature species.  You can assure him thats true cant you?
Wormhole distortion has over loaded main power systems...
No more than I expected  Not as difficult as this. Im sorry...
Impact in fifteen seconds...
Mr. Decker I will not provoke an attack If that order isnt clear to you...
Communicated with us UhowU?
Any reply from them?
... they may have followed it UtooU precisely.
Exact patterns. The energy bolt that hit them wasnt simply a weapon  it dematerialized them stored them. But why?
Captain I do not believe there UisU a crew  or that this is a vessel as such.
A life form of its own a conscious living entity.
The point... 
... and then to reassemble itself UcombinedU with the Creator. The most certain way of obtaining all the Creators answers.
That seems to be what it has planned  to have the Creator physically present here.
Captain Decker requested I complete final Science briefing here before...

Tucker hasnt penned Bens present yet  it wont be too much longer.
Hey. Whats up?

Conan OBrien? Whoa What are you doing here?
Be your sidekick you know and maybe eventually become a TV talk show host.
It was Gods will.
No Mikey.
Im always working.
This is work.
No.
My Jesus
My baby.
Youre showing how superior you are to your subject. TOBY No but I like my subject. I like these people.
What?
Of course honey. Come in bed with us. Come on.
I dunno.
How was the class?
You mean again?
Well then maybe you should just read the ending.
Dont be so upset. Its OK...
You know he hated my story also.
I have a cousin. Very big giver to the alumni fund.
...But Mr Livingston arent you a bit fearful that Scooby will be confronted with hollow values and systemic conformism?
Dad Im trying to figure things out right now OK? Its like really hard and Im just listening to some old Elton John and...
Dont screw around with me. You know what Im talking about.  Youre taking those SATs. Youre taking those SATs or your CD collection is history. Youre taking those SATs and youre going to college. Youre taking those SATs if I have to strap your ass to a chair but buddy your taking them.
Maybe hes building a bomb...just like
Sure Dad.
What are you doing here?
Im not going out with Catherine.
Take off your top.
Say Ni...
Say Nigger fuck me hard
Oh fine. How are you?
Great
I worked over at a homeless shelter for a while drove a cab to pay the rent but I mean that was like  I mean I have some dignity.
Oh. Tired of life in the fast lane?
Yeah sure.
You should be.
Yeah. I know.
Yyes
Well II hope thatthat
Why? Are we going dancing?
Just the soda please. Cooper heads down the hall.  Filmore watches him leave sighs then turns and smiles at the General manager
What happened
You should listen your old man more often.  Hes got principles.
After Leizburg he stuck his neck out to defend me.  Hes loyal to the end. Even if its notpolitically correct at the time.
What happened?
Well Cooper...
I dont see why they wouldnt be.
Hey now  No cussing on TV  Well in closing Id like to say that there are two reasons to have that money outside in an hour.  One is my perky coanchor here and the second is the lives of tens of thousands of peoplepeople just like you and me
I dont want any...
I said I dont want any goddammit
Weve prohibited the networks from broadcasting the transmissions.
Chemcos been developing nerve gas?
The ball is in Richters court.  But were sure as hell not going to sit on our hands while he assassinates peoplewere gonna stop the sonof abitch
I assure you gentlemen if we had something of that magnitude it wouldnt be shelved in a lab somewhere...
Richterwe got a problem
Excellent...excellent
What are you so worked up about jack? Fuck emwe dont need em.
Youre fucking crazy Richteryou know that?
Dissent?
How much of this shit do they have White
Certainly  how about some breakfast?
Now Mister Ambassador.  In a very few moments we should have Premier Belch on the phone.  I intend to tell him exactly what has happened.  I merely want you to authenticate certain facts for him.
At his office in the Capitol.
Did you get that Kulnick?
First of all economic reasons.  It was cheap.  The entire project cost just a fraction of what we spent in a single year on our various space and missile programs. It also seemed ideal in most other respects. It was terrifying convincing automatic and extremely simple to understand.
Allow me to assure you that my government will not be satisfied with a polite note of regret for this shocking example of aggression against our peaceloving people.
It is very convenient to place all the blame on a dead man.
I caught you redhanded Mister Ambassador.
See  See I told you.
Come in...come in... Peace On Earth... Peace On Earth...yes...
Look I didnt shoot him
Look Colonel.  Maybe its too late. Maybe theyve sent Air Command in already.  But weve got to try to con tact somebody.
Wait a minute.  The President  Thats it The President
What is your name young lady?
What did you say sir?
Yes sir.  He issued attack orders to 
Im afraid Ill have to ask you to take the film out.
Well...I suppose penetrate the base by force.
This is General Ripper speaking.
No sir.
Thats right sir.
I understand sir.  Nothing comes or goes without your personal sayso.
Yes sir.  I just thought of something sir.  How do I know Im talking to you now?
No sir.  PlanR to be radioed to the Wing.
I know that sir.
Ask away Major.
Youre being dense Major.  I certainly dont
Youre absolutely right.  You forgot to mention their nuclear subs.  But it wouldnt matter. Sure we wouldnt get off without getting our hair mussed but wed prevail.  I dont think wed lose more than fifty million people tops.
Major Mandrake I guess you dont follow whats going on too closely do you?
Where?  Everywhere Major.  Everywhere.
Youre very naive Major.  Dont they say they want disarmament?
But war doesnt make sense precisely because the weapons can kill an entire country  right?
I was just going to say as long as the weapons exist sooner or later somethings going to happen  and thatll be it for both countries.
Well sir I remember an example that pointed out that if a system was safe on 99.99 of the days of the year given average luck it would fail in thirty years.
Gee sir that last remark doesnt exactly make all the sense in the world.
Well Im not sir.  Honestly sir.
Dont you think he knows something about this General Ripper?
But General were on our toes.  We havent agreed to anything for years.  Inffact a a lot of people say we never will.
Well what about the Positive Control the safety catch?  Dont the planes automatically come back unless they get a second order?
And I suppose theres some reason why you havent recalled them?
What the hell is PlanR?
Why cant you cancel it?
Thats the idea General Schmuck.  Zlat
Well just common sense sir.  Thirty from thirtyfour equals four or my names not Buck Schmuck
Yes sir.  Were still sending it.  But its a funny thing we dont seem to be able to make any contact with the aircraft at all.
If I can speak freely sir  look these guys talk big but frankly we think theyre short of knowhow.  You cant just take a bunch of ignorant peasants and expect them to understand a machine like one of our boys and I dont mean that as an insult Mister Ambassador.  Hell we all know what kind of guts your people have.  Why just look how many millions of em those Nazis  killed and hell they still wouldnt quit.
Thanks Binky.  Can you see Bromdingna Island yet?
Cant help it.  Whats the wind like?
They must have clobbered some of our cities already
Fifteen  Twelve o clock.

Seond safety.
All right Lothat that does it.  Master safety on now until bomb run.
Hell he looks dead.
What do you mean?
Well we sure as hell arent going home just because the enemy tells us to.
You tell me.

But I TOLD YOU I dont think we can get the bomb bay doors open.

My what?
Virgin Mary musta snuck that one in.
Stop it  This is crazy
I hear she was a terror to work with.
Youll pardon me Norma? Why dont you just sit and watch?  O.K.  Here we go.
Action The scene starts.
Dont worry.  Shes just a fan for my literary output.
Ive got to run along.  Thanks any way for your interest in my career.
Nothing for Ladd?
Schaefer.  Betty Schaefer.  And right now I wish I could crawl into a hole and pull it in after me.
I just think pictures should say a little something.
Im sorry Mr. Gillis but I just dont think its any good. I found it flat and banal.
Sure.  Bases Loaded.
Dark Windows.  How did you like it?
Im serious.  Ive got a few ideas.
Life can be beautiful
Is that so? Whats the wonderful news?
Well for heavens sake
Why should you do that?
See if they make sense.  To begin with I think you should throw out all that psychological stuff  exploring a killers sick mind.
This story is about teachers  their threadbare lives their struggles.  Here are people doing the most important job in the world and they have to wprry about getting enough money to resole their shoes.  To me it can be as exciting as any chase any gunplay.
It will?
Come clean Betty.  At night you weep for those lost closeups those gala openings...
Something came up.  I dont want to talk about it.
Its nothing.  I got a telegram from Artie.
I dont know why Im so scared Joe.  Is it something awful?
I didnt come here to see a house. What about Norma Desmond?
No no I havent heard any of this.  I never got those telephone calls.  Ive never been in this house ... Get your things together. Lets get out of here.
Joe I cant look at you any more.
Thats no excuse.  You read the script didnt you?
Dont play innocent.  Somebody named Gordon Cole.
Lady.  youve got the wrong man.
Depends on what it is  a Donald Duck or Joan or Arc.
Looks like enough for six impor tant pictures.
Right now?  Never let another writer read your stuff.  He may steal it.
Sure you did.  Thats what makes it great.  What it needs is a little more dialogue.
I dont know.
December twentyfirst.
Are you married Mr.   ?
You can stay here.
Thanks for the invitation but I have my own apartment.
Ill take care of that.
Im used to paying my own bills.
Just a scene I cut out.
The one where you go to the slave market.  You can cut right to the scene where John the Baptist 
Cant you wait till Im dummy?
Whats wrong with It?
I dont like those studs theyve sent.  I want you to have pearls. Nice big pearls.
There are no other guests.  We dont want to share this night with other people.  This is for you and me.
Come midnight how about blind folding the orchestra and smash ing champagne glasses on Maxs head?
Has it ever occurred that I may have a life of my own? That there may be some girl Im crazy about?
What kind of a silly thing was that to do?
Not until you promise to act like a sensible human being.
Theyre awful.  They make me cough.
Maybe deMille is shooting.
Hea a shrewd old fox.  He can smell box office.  Only Im going to outfox him a litt1e.  This isnt going to be C. B. deMilles Salome. Its going to be Norma Desmonds Salome a Norma Desmond Production starring Norma Desmond...Home Max.
Good night.
I went for a walk.
I havent done anything Norma.
Max is a good idea.  He can help with my luggage.  Thanks for letting me wear the handsome wardrobe.  And thanks for the use of all the trinkets.
You think I made that up about the gun...
Wake up Norma.  Youd be killing yourself to an empty house.  The audience left twenty years ago. Now face it.
Go on in.
Dressed for what?
Thanks.  Say shes quite a character that Norma Desmond.
It was the room of the husband. Or of the husbands I should say. Madame has been married three times.
I wouldnt look too closely at the postmarks.
That didnt leave much for Wallace Reid.
I just found out why all those tele phone calls.  It is not Miss Desmond they want.  It is the car they want to rent.
Its just that Im very worried about Madame.
What car?
Its about a ball player a rookie shortstop thats batting 347.  The poor kid was once mixed up in a hold up.  But hes trying to go straight  except theres a bunch of gamblers who wont let him.
Bases Loaded.  Theres a 4Opage outline.
Frankly no.
Maybe what you need is another agent.
Did you intend to kill him? Just answer me that.
Okay.  And lets have the car right outside.
Yes Madame.
Now now do you belive me? I told you deMille would jump at it.
But the phantom Zone is for criminals.
What is it?
The danger. The one Nigel spoke of. It must be near .
And then like great catswe pounce And destroy
He will be. In about five minutes.
No a super girl.
Ive been saving it. For the right moment.
Yes of course it was foolish of me.
And the first thing we do is get rid of Supergirl
Who didnt?
Its not important. The important thing is Im here to find something and I think you can he1p me.
Of course not but...there are things we dont understand.
Terrific.
Ethanwhen I said a while I meant a couple of hours.
I sort of like what you said.
It seemed that way to me.
I know what it is. She has this lead container shaped like a gargoyle. Inside theres a silvery ring...
Can you get us out? Its all a misunderstanding. We thought they were selling hamburgers in that place.
What an adorable hat.
But she is real it wasnt just a concussion.
Well...I guess I cant.
Ive got things to do.
How do you know?
Did anybody notice you?
Lucy Be serious. We could be executed for  treason
I wish theyd tell us what theyre going to do with us.
Why havent you been able to contact him? He should have returned from the neutron galaxy ages ago. He may be dead. ZOREL But what can you a mere girl
It was my fault. You arent old enough to use the wand. I shouldnt have given it to you.
No sweat. Whens the rest of your stuff arriving?
Since what?? Did you have a fire at your house or something?
But what for?
It doesnt seem right.
Hes nice.
I have to get back. Im having dinner with the Danvers.
It may well be. I know how you won that election Selena. You cant fool me.
Throw him out.
We are in great danger. A being has come to Earth with powers far beyond those of anyone member of the Craft.
Why get rid of her at al1? Youve used the Coffer of Shadow too much.  It is beginning to rule your heart.
Not yet.
Its the most beautiful place in the universe.
Its everywhere. But water is always the door.
I knew it
Going to try. Didnt say I could.
Dont stop. Keep moving.
Its Selena. Im getting so I can recognise her work.
Zaltar
Buddy are we in trouble.
Good lord fella Im talking about your boss.
Theres no vodka in it.
What? What did you tell me?
Brad.
Brad Wilson.
You always did.  Can I give you a hand with that?
And here I am just standing here. Thats terrible. Thank you.

Whatm I gonna do with half a cent? Buy me a thoroughbred cockroach?  Everybody loses them fractions?
Uh...yeah. I didnt think of it that way exactly but...
Black or regular?

Yeah yeah I can do it.
First question got to be Where.
Just the man I wanted to see

They aint got captains?
Pumps stop pumping oil. Pipe lines stop pipin oil. Tankers stop deliverin oil. Man this is high stakes.
I knew it I knew it go be nice to people and they think they can ask for the moon
I should think a taste of freedom is enough dont you? Or would you prefer jail?
Dont be getting racist with me man.
For what?
What will it get me?
Man all it got to do is find their weak spot.  You bet on the machine in any fight you name you gonna win your bet.
Sister Im his sister
Oh Bubba think of the possibilities.
What about me?
Okay Kent call your people and tell them the Prodigal Son is coming home. FAVORING CLARK  Happy now he turns to leave the office. SHOT LOSES PERRY but we continue to hear his voice o.s.
Bubba does this woman have the right to burst in without knocking...

Storms Floods

Thats because you can hardly see through those things.
I was getting hot dogs. What do you mean?
Dont fake me out Clark.  Or whoever you are.
Lois help I cant   I cant swim  
Lois I . . .

Youre not selfish at all.
Everybody. Everybody else. Id be buying my little rainbow at the their expense. All the ones who say Help. Come quick. Now I know who youd have to pick.
Please dont tell me Youll find somebody else someday. Cause . . .  . . . well you are a pretty hard act to follow youll have to admit that.  Oh Ill get by dont worry about me.
Take it easy. Take a deep breath.
Thats why they call em terrorists.  Go down to the morgue and dig up anything you can find on past incidents of 
The minute the story broke I bundled her on the first Concord out of here. If Paris goes kablooey I want the best reporter Ive got right there in the middle of it.
I wouldnt know. Ive never had one.
So does your average cocker spaniel. Give me another one.  Under . . . the big one there.
It s fantastic  This place is genius.

To ski?
Oh That black box in our cell?
Hey dont worry. Youll be fine Just . . . well dont rush it.
Listen. Have I got a proposition for you Superman. I mean I owe you one you know? Now dont say yes or no till you hear me out . . .

Yes?
Dont worry. I will draw his fire.  With a few of my own.
Dont worry Ive got you.
Yes I know. Im sure it will be a great story.
I dont think fan mail fits this letter.  Read it Clark.
Its her fathers grey matter thats weakened if you ask me. How can I ask Superman such a dumb question.
Everyones saying hes . . . dead. But I know that isnt true. I feel it in my heart. I think he just needs help.
And what am I? A Shriner? No If youll join forces with me together we can make the world safe for war profits again.
Absolutely
Jeremy I need you to tell the people of the world what you see.
I know Daddy. Im worried about him.
Dont be overdramatic young lady. What kind of disaster could we help bring about?
. . . And  very nave
Lenny you pathetic product of the public school system. Your Uncle Lex has had only one thing on his awesome mind during his incarceration . . . Destroying Superman
A toupee that flies?
Lets try to keep your I.Q. a family secret Leonard. Before we launch him against Superman we have to test him ... see how well he does with mayhem and destruction. Kind of a coming out party under the glare of media covering the Metro Club gala. And once he proves himself then . . .
Not how I might have put it but correct. The remains I sent to the sun included the creatures genetic memory. Hell remember everything that he experienced. Not to worry. Hell find his way back to me.  Did you hear that?
There
What?
Never. But we have to hide out for a  while. Lay low. Say. . . a couple of years. By then Ill have a new plan.
Wait Not yet Back

Youre not the only one.
You too.  I just...I cant get it on for good guys. Yknow?
Look lady you saved my life once. I owe you a favor. But I cant understand why you follow a man like that.

What about dinner? I have to worry about the crime of the century thats all. Yknow? Am I supposed to worry about whats in the refrigerator too?  Whats in it?
Tough guy huh?
Krypton? The place where Superman comes from?
Bingo

I dont like to talk about it Lex.
You ever try to run in high heels?  You probably did.
You? How about me?
Hit you? A clever girl like you?  He turned slowly slowly in the lava... was how you described it. Now thats clever.  I have to hand it to you.
A night on the town instead of under it?

Lex is going byebye.
You are one of Kryptons greatest scientists JorEl 
And the people on the street the little man who runs the corner newsstand the old lady sunning herself on the stoop the kids playing stick ball  none of them will ever forget the night of senseless bloodletting that turned a friendly block part into a nightmare. 
Dont brag now  Jonathan.
A million years behind us.  JorEl hes only a baby.
I want to know what my child is going to face.
Enjoyed it?
Nine to five its a Pulitzer Prize I know.
Lets just say Im a friend.  And watch yourself from now on with those things Okay?  I mean if the good lord wanted people to fly he would have given them wings.
Ask Youre the girl reporter.
The reason I can fly is because my molecular structure is so constituted that I have a lighter density under Earths gravitational force.
Its not bad.
Thirtyfive.
Matter? With me? Nothings the matter.
I guess I...uh...regressed.
Maybe its being polished or something. Maybe theyre cleaning it.
Sure. Its the joining together of two land masses pushed together eight million years ago. The fault line itself is unstable and always shifting which is the reason you get earthquakes in the California area from time to time.
Ally.  That was my nickname.
How is Mrs. Stephens?
Sunnyridge.  That was a long time
It turns to steaming piss.
Not unless you can raise the dead.
You can help each other.  Several people have agreed to let me represent them in a negligence suit. Your case as an individual will be stronger if Im allowed to represent you together as a group.
Hi Mr. Ansel.  Hi Jessica Mason...
Was it good?
Okay.
Yeah.
Well I dont want a damned thing to do with it.
So?  I mean lots of folks have got lawyers.

Risa I serviced that bus.  At the garage.  Theres nothing wrong with it.
Why?
Well I dont.
Do they have any reputation for drugs?
Did he have any particular problems that you knew of?  Financial pressures...runins with the law...
And whats that?
You mentioned that he had a learning disability.
Did his parents attend to that?
Mrs.  Driscoll if Billy Ansel does not volunteer to say so in court I will subpoena him and oblige him to testify to that effect.
What other people?
A cup of tea would be nice.  Would it be alright if I sit down for a few minutes Mrs. Otto?  I want to talk to you.
No.  A little sugar though.
Summers over.  Its fall.
I wont lie.
You seem very sure about that.
Was the bus on time?
Did there come a time when the bus turned off Staples Mill Road onto
She...she was a friend of mine.
People who will help our cause.
Crafts?
Thanks.
Is there shrimp on it?
Who did they get for that?
Mrs.  Otto  there is no such thing as an accident.  The word doesnt mean anything to me.  As far as Im concerned somebody somewhere made a decision to cut a corner.  Some corrupt agency or corporation accounted the cost variance between a tencent bolt and a million dollar outofcourt settlement.  They decided to sacrifice a few lives for the difference.  Thats whats done Mrs. Otto.  Ive seen it happen so many times before.
And according to your recollection there was nothing unusual about the drive that morning?
Yes.
I remember the bus swerved it just suddenly swerved to the right and it hit the guardrail and the snowbank on the side of the road and then it went over the embankment there and everyone was screaming and everything.  And thats all.  I guess I was unconscious after that. Thats all.  Then I was in the hospital.
Really?
Its okay.
As opposed to this T.V.?
How about Sunday night?  Thats always the best time.
Its too late for that.  She cant drive the bus anymore.  The school board saw to that right off.
But Charlene...
You dont know that.
Alone or surrounded?
Dont apologize for me Frank
Not that Im convinced but youll never prove it in a million years.  Steve youll do what you want but it cant hurt he offers you an olive branch  so today like olives
Your nephew doesnt want a drink.
Yeah and its the truth to the best of my knowledge.  And frankly Im glad.  For Steves sake Im glad not yours.  I manage these boys and I got their best interests at heart.  Steve shouldnt get mixed up with no bimbo at his age.
Not in those exact words  you know what a temper hes got.
Coupla weeks.  For eight weeks.
I dont like this threatening attitude.  When it comes to it what the heck is it your business what they do this boy and girl...
And instead he printed his heel in your face?
Otis was outraged when I told him Van Cleve was going to fire you. Tell him not to pay any attention to anything youknowwho says about youknowwhat.  Right Otis?
Give me a chance 
Hes here isnt he?  Do you think sir when he dies hell go to the dog and cat heaven?
But that wasnt your fault dear what happened to Leslie.  Ive told you that a million times...
I thought we were talking about Sidney?
Im taking up the situation with you now...
A man couldnt ask for a squarer shake.  Let me have Billy Van Cleve...  Dont ever tell anyone Susie how Im tied to your apron strings...  Billy  J.J.  Whats this about that boy?  What boy?  Where are we lug in a drawing room comedy? Youre brain is warming up sweetheart  yeah Dallas...  No dont explain your point of view but...
No...
No.  Im going home.
Bonna sera commendatore.  Come sta?
You just had a good example of it. A press agent eats a columnists dirt and is expected to call it manna.
You print them dont you?
Then maybe you can tell me if hes as solid as you say why does he rap me every chance he gets?
Get Steve back his job...please...
Yes.  With your prestige it only takes a minute  ten cents worth of American Tel and Tel.
No thats the point  he wont accept your favor  The manager yes but not the boy.
She knows now.
He goes out with girls.
Yeah...  And another thing  hes gonna say you resisted arrest...  You know J.J....
And why should I bribe the woman who holds most of my heart?
No.  Its one of J.J.s occasional beau gestes.  Evidently the fellows funny so he gave him a plug.
I dont know  its a big apartment. But I wasnt interviewed.  In fact I was totally unprepared for what happened.
Help me with two minutes of silence
Sidney please dear if you feel nervous...
Stay down town tonight.  Maybe well take in a show etc.
Frank thinks I shouldnt have come here 
Only two men in this town could be responsible for that smear  you or Hunsecker or both.
Temple I caught your act the other night and 
You tell him I stutter
What ship?
Dont explain Sidney... It doesnt matter now...
That was two months ago.  Take your hand out of my pocket thief
Steve dear please forget all of this.  What can it matter after tomorrow?
Susie I was there for OUR sake too.  But what a world it would be if we were all afraid to learn to walk and talk because it might offend poppa  By the way I think your brother was completely responsible for the smears...
But please Steve please  one step at a time  I was born only yesterday...
Im sorry baby.  This thing is just kicking my ass.  I thought we had it with this one...
You are targeted for termination.  The T1000 will not stop until it complete its mission. Ever.
Max.
It cant form complex machines.  Guns and explosives have chemicals moving parts.  It doesnt work that way.  But it can form solid metal shapes.
Yeah well fuck you shes a priority to me
Of course.  Im a terminator.
Why?
Right.
No problemo.
Yeah I thought youd like this place.
I dont care Theres gotta be another way. Havent you learned anything?  Havent you figured out why you cant kill people?
Im sorry John.
Actually no shes a complete psycho.  Thats why shes up at Pescedero.  She tries to blow up a computer factory but she got shot and arrested.
I need to know how Skynet get built.  Whos responsible?
SHOOT
Dont quit Sarah.  Our son need you.
Remember the message... the future is not set. There is not fate but what we make for ourselves.
Theres 215 bones in the human body motherfucker. Thats one.  Now dont move
And Skynet fights back.
Jesus.  How much do you know about Dyson?
No.  There is another chip.
Major Arnold believes he has a moral duty too.
But it still doesnt make them saints. They still have to get up and piss in the middle of the night dont they? They can still be vindictive and envious and mean just like you and me. Well just like me. Cant they?
A human being oh good Im relieved I thought you were going to say you were a music lover. This man this great artist has made antiSemitic remarks like you wouldnt believe. I got letters.
Not yet.
Dont talk about things you know nothing about. He was in a dictatorship
In a dictatorship art belongs to the Party. If you want to be a conductor you have to have an orchestra. And you can only get an orchestra if you have contact with the power. All over the world you need the right contacts and you have to make the right compromises.
There are good Party members who help and there are dirty nonParty members who inform on you. Of course they gave him privileges.
I have a duty.
No. Ours was damaged.
I did not conduct at at the rally I conducted on the evening before the rally.
Could I have a glass of water please? Please Fraulein?
I need to work. I need to make my living. I live off the generosity of friends...
Then why is it please that another conductor who was actually a member of the Party who used to play the Horst Wessel before his concerts has already been cleared and is working again while I have to wait and wait and wait?
I believe it was because of another letter Id written to Goebbels lamenting the decline of musical standards due to racial policies.
During an enforced hourlong interval because of a power failure at a concert here in Berlin Albert Speer the Minister of Armaments said to me You look very tired Dr. Furtwngler you should go abroad for a while. I knew exactly what he meant.
If you are going to bully me like this Major you had better do your homework. You obviously have no idea how impertinent and stupid your questions are.
Dont talk to me like I was a second violinist. Go back into the waiting room. Miss Straube will come and get you when I am ready to see you.
Well I tried you got to admit I tried. I thought I might just trap you there Wilhelm but David here was too quick for me. Smart move David smart move. No I dont have the telegram but I know it exists. And I want you to know Wilhelm were going to keep looking for it because I believe you sent it.
Art and politics yeah art and politics. Lets look at that. You and the Berlin Philharmonic toured the Third Reich played in countries the Nazis had conquered. Are you saying that conducting in occupied territories from 1939 on wasnt a commercial for Adolf and all he stood for?
No
No Im not going to stop it. Hitler himself offered you a beautiful house and a personal bomb shelter.
I dont understand what you mean.
It means I wasnt good enough to be a first violinist.
Do you know Hans Hinkel?
Helmuth.
How could I forget?
So. You wanted to see me.
Major were discussing a man of genius I dont want...
One of my people?
No. But thats why we hated him. We admired him as a conductor but we all hated him too because he didnt have to join the Party and yet he had a better life than any of us. He didnt have to go and deliver a report after every trip abroad. He got everything from them everything. He was filthier than any of us Party members.
Whos he?
His private life?
Like this bandleader.
Absolutely not.
He also conducted for Hitler didnt he?
Youre late.
Not really.  Do you think you can get here on time if I put you on the floor as a waitress?
Its not brain surgery Chuck.
A phased plasma pulselaser in the forty watt range...
We will kiddo.
Whats it to ya?
Whats it to ya?
Look Reese I know you want to help but...
Tell me.  Just start at the beginning.
What?
What about it?
Thats the way it was told to me.
Nitroglycerin basically. Bit more stable.  I learned howto make it when I was a kid.
Its better that way.
Kyle...
Yes.
That cant be right.  Thats the name of the one Valley Division mopped up this after noon.
You gotta be kidding me.  The new guysll be shortstroking it over this one.  A oneday pattern killer.
I know.
Suspect westbound on Olympic.  Grey sedan.  Has hostage repeat...
Now look...
Did you?  Kudos.
I said I was sorry...
Whats going on?  Im going on my second job this month and now Im going on unemployment.
What... is... happening... ?
What are you talking about?
You mean the guy who turned blue and uwetu himself... ?
Why not?
You first.
You pull me up.
Whats C.R.S.?
Me?  Youre the one who...   Shit
... two hundred dollars a toe.
Nicholas.  Nicholas Van Orton.
I dont think Ive ever spent this much time with someone who didnt even ask my name.
Well... the red bra.
I didnt say anything.
What do you mean?  I checked them myself.  I made the calls...
What... what do you mean?
You tell me... I want to know whos behind this.  Who did this to me... how why... ?
They will  You tell them if they dont come now I will shoot you
What are you doing?
Stop it
Single?
Conrad what a surprise.  Gesundheit.
Seymour Butts.  I never get tired of that one.
Which gradschool?
Elizabeth?
No.
I said I would...
Okay okay... okay?  I just... you know I hate surprises.
You think I know?  I paid them umoreu to make it stop.
No.  Do you?  Cant be too hard can it?  I dont think we should be here out in the open like this.
Stop this.  Its not true...
This... ?  Oh this is just... this is the bill.
Yes.
Yes.
Im not quite sure how this works. My brother...
Whats all this for?
No I mean what is it FOR?  What are you selling?
Cursory examination.  Turnyourhead andcough sort of thing.  Youll be out of here in no time.
Dont take another step.
Have we met?
Is there a room key?
No you didnt...
Have a nice day.
Thank you.  Goodnight.
Okay.  I think hes into some sort of new personal improvement cult.
Did the alarm go off?  The house... they... you didnt see... ?
Its a private matter for you... I think youll be more comfortable...
His behavior... ?
A gentleman left a message requesting a lunch but I assured him...
Nothing.  Nothing at all.
That youve involved Conrad... is unforgivable.  I am now your enemy.
It was a misunderstanding.
What about the house?
What?
Whos Watts?
I did okay.
I thought it best to be isolated to be in a location with a definite sense of history and I wanted to make sure that it wasnt so pleasant youd all sleep too easily.  Youll be taking a variety of tests none of them harmful and youve got the house the grounds and each other to keep you company.
Yeah.
Sure.
Go ahead.
Its a question.
Just stay there Nell
He must have left.  Didnt like the looks of the place or something.
It was very specific.
I wasnt thinking about my mothers bathroom.
Yes.
I wish I were.  I wish I had done it then I could confess and youd be at peace.  That great moral philosopher Frank Sinatra once said to someone he loved I wish you had an enemy so I could beat him up.
I dont know.
Nell.  You will come here now.
Nell the first time I ever spoke with you in person was the night we met here.
Howd I know it was for you?
Every day.  Basically well be hanging out together like we have so far this evening.
Good morning Theo.  Luke.
Mary came with me.
How could you do this to people?
Thats a good question.  What is it about fences?  Sometimes a locked chain makes people on both sides of the fence just a little more comfortable.  Why would that be?
Ive seen em.  Lot to dust.
Its all I could afford.
My boyfriend thinks so my girlfriend doesnt.  If we could all live together... but... they hate each other.  Its hard to be Miss Perversity when youre the only one at the party.  Dyou know what I mean?
Maybe you did it yourself.
Because I dont want to ruin things.  Because home is where the heart is.
Carolyn showed me where she hid him hid him with all the ones he killed 
Nell it makes sense.  It all makes sense.  You and I we were scaring each other working each other up.
I dont think I want any.
I uwantu to know why you uneedu that scary guy in your house.
Im loyal to things that make me happy.
All your life.  That happened while I swam the length of my pool.
Just feels like the car behind has been following us the longest time.
Why not?
This is unfucking professional.
Why because youre my security consultant?  This cocksucker nearly burnt my house down.
And where is this guest?  Dont they want to interview him.
Well find him.
You could use a few of my prime shitkickers up here.
England.  Only we saw there was a show on thought I might pick something up for a price type of thing.
Round about yeah.
It was better than a telegram.
Terry Valentine.
Im just sayin  it was a steep hillside.  There was no moon that night ...
Thats what I thought man.  But it was not a hotel or nothin that we went to. It was someplace else.
Nah coppers dont do nothing do they.
Nicks a nick n it?  No matter what state youre in.  State of remorse most likely  for gettin caught.
What do I do then look in the bleedin Yellow Pages?
Travelling on a dodgy passport n all.
Butchers hook.  Look.  I dont much reckon those minders of his.
Hes brought in the heavy mob.
You goin back inside?
Well those are the breaks.
No but I know what he means.
Wanted to talk to you didnt I?
I heard you were  whats that adorable phrase?  at Her Majestys pleasure.
Hardly buried.  Earning interest love. Earning interest in an offshore account. Tidy little premium per annum that.
Now whos being sarcastic?
Not ashamed.
She never told Eddie though.
 Mr. Lindgren.
We were uluckyu to be nicked.  Me and the lads went down there Sunday evening we werent discovered till the Monday.  Good job we were still breathing.
He alive to see this?
Do us a favor.  Cant even go have a slash without em saying whatre you going in there for?
A leech on the welfare state in addition. You dont miss a trick.
She never would have turned you in not in a million years.
How do you know?
Good job your lot showed up when they did or it wouldve been umeu for the high jump.
Oh yeah right.  The deal.
And that is?
My client has already given a statement regarding yesterdays events.
Hes always been very forwardthinking. He invested wisely.
Ian?
Right.  Chain of respect.  Thats good that.
Nine years?  Is that legal?
Very attractive.  Good idea.  Now I ureallyu want to fuck you.
I dont know.
So what.
Lemme break.
Somethings on.
Like hed never hire me for real.  Not weektoweek.  I dont have the credentials.  He thinks Im just a sociopath someone he can turn to when he needs plausible denial.
I doubt it.
Yeah.  I know her all right.  She came down here once stirred up a shitstorm. We lost a full days work took me weeks to get back on schedule.  If she hadnt a been Terrys woman I wouldve broke her jaw.  Course shes nobodys problem now.
Listen get the fuck out of here before you get hurt.  Who the fuck do you think you are waltzing in here asking questions?
I dont want you here Terry.
Susan.
We went camping last summer. In Eugene Oregon. Outside of Eugene Ed.
A spacecraft. I saw the creatures. They led Big Dave onto the craft. He never told anyone what they did outside of his report. Of course he told me. No one else.
Sometimes knowledge is a curse Ed. After this happened things changed. Big Dave... he never touched me again.
Im so sorry... I was sorry to hear.
Thats what he keeps telling me.
Boy.
Oh Mr Crane
He didnt say that.
Well? Howd she do?
I dont understand no mistakes shes just a kidI thought you taught the uh the
Well look I dont claim to be an expert
That right.
Ill have it in a week.
Way out of line.
Sure.
Yeah.
And Ive never been askedLook you want the dough back? You know who I am You
...Why dont you just pay him Dave?
...Huh?
Just coffee.
Honey?
Nah go ahead. Im not big on parties.
Hows that?
I didnt say a word.
Honey...
What happened to you?
Nah dont say anything. Im alright.
I... just knew. A husband knows.
I dont know. I dont think so.
I took Doriss keys.
So who should I
Uhhuh. Is he the best then for uh...
Yeah.
Check out the rack on that broad in the angora.
Sorry I just didnt remember.
Uhhuh.
Yeah yeahgo home.
Come on Eddie youre gonna scare the kid.
Yeah.
Frank uh you know Ill try to contribute but uhFreddy Riedenschneider
Uhhuh.
Huh? No.
Crane. Ed Crane.
Hello.
Ahhah. It would be best if he waited here.
They sent us to tell ya.
Visiting ends at five. Too late today. You can see her tomorrow.
Im in.
Weve been operating in the red for years.  That was the whole idea behind the Superstition Exhibit.  It was designed to pull people in. Weve spent every penny we have on advance publicity betting everything on the openings success. If we postpone at the last minute... No.  I dont want to think about that.
Wheres the walkin safe?
Whats the combination?
Calm down.  I found it
Lets go
Like hell
Special Agent Pendergast.  FBI.
Correct.
Apparently its huge.
What is it?
I know.
Someone who makes the Hacksaw Murderer look like Mother Teresa.
We cant do without you.  Youre one of the foremost authorities on primitive pharmacology.  Youre practically an institution around here.
Your work is highly relevant.  What about your display on Primitive Pharmacology?  Cuthbert told me himself he was going to feature it prominently in the Superstition Exhibit.
Im not giving up.
You are this museum.  It wont be the same without you.
Cuthberts counting on the exhibitions success.  The museum is in debt.  Contributions and public funding have dried up.  Admissions no longer cover overhead.  The last big infusion of cash we had was the King Tut exhibit.  Cuthbert was hired to get us out of the red.  If the Superstition Exhibit isnt lucrative hell have to start auctioning off some of these gems.
Im not sure.  As you know the Kothoga lived outside civilization on the tepui for thousands of years. Species flourished in isolation when man and pollution rendered them extinct.  This could be one of the last remaining samples of an unknown plant.
Lets not jump to conclusions.  This egg could belong to any number of reptiles Dr. Frock.
Thats not so unusual.  Many plants carry viruses.  Like the burls on Maple trees.
Quadrupedal  The other name for Mbwun.  He Who Walks on All Fours.
Margo what youve just described is a killing machine.
Some kind of power failure.  Maybe its the storm.  Do you have a flashlight?
We cant.  Weve managed to get inside the one place thats safe.  I think we should sit tight and wait for reinforcements.  If we go outside were risking more lives. You have to accept it Margo theres nothing we can do.  The building must be swarming with police by now.  It wont take long for them to get through the doors.
We will.
Happy to be useful.  Its rare enough these days.  According to security Beauregard put the Whittlesley crates in storage area 1012.
I dont believe it.
They were sent to the Center For Disease Control in Atlanta.
Big as a house.
Well almost.  Depends which house.  It smelled like old hamburger and it made this weird noise.
They were green eyes and they were slit like a lizards.
The dogs have lost the scent Mr. Pendergast.  Maybe we should head back.
Holy mother what is that?
Not on the map.  Looks like it connects with the city sewer.
Another storage room.
But at what a price.
Lizard DNA and human DNA on the same strand?  Impossible.  The sample must be contaminated.
You have time to talk?
You were afraid of him werent you?
I dont think so.  I think we were meant to think it was Mbwun.  Did Whittlesleys monster have claws?
I dont know.
You were behind me?  Running after me?
I dont know.  Mr. Pendergast.  Do me a favor.  Get me a DNA readout on that claw.
No.  I think Im hallucinating.
Its not supernatural.  Mbwun is an animal.  Part lizard part human a genetic freak of some kind like the halfgoat halfsheep they found last year in the jungles of Vietnam.
We have the fibers.  Dont you see? The creature is hungry.  It wants the hormones in these plants.  It would take hundreds of human brains to supply whats in these fibers.  Were just a poor substitute.  To make it stop hunting we have to give it what it wants.
The planetarium
No.  The planetarium is in the next cell.  This is one of the fire doors...
Its eyesight is worse than I thought.  It couldnt see us.  And it couldnt smell us through the glass.
How?
I have to shoot.
One.
We ihavei had our close calls in the past.
a dead one at that.
As you know ratings have never been our primary goal.  I imagine well lose those voyeurs only interested in witnessing Trumans latest torment.  However Im certain that our core audience will remain loyal.
All products carefully chosen and tested by you for quality and aesthetic value.
Guess I always thought theyd adopt.
So when are you leaving?
Sure.  Its halogen.  Shame it didnt hit you  you couldve sued.  You coming for a drink?
Your Dad?
Its a lot of world for one man.  You sure thats not wishful thinking you wishing youd made something more of yourself? Christ Truman who hasnt sat on the John and had an imaginary interview on Seahaven Tonight?  Who hasnt wanted to be somebody?
Truman youre gonna be late
Its a surprise.
Ive been thinking
I made macaroni.
You blaming me for the traffic?
Theres been an accident Truman.
Im sure theyre just exaggerating.
Why do you want to have a child with me? You cant stand me.
Do something...
Truman youre gonna be late
Hold on a minute dear.  Heres us at Mount Rushmore.  You remember Trumanwhen Dad was still with us  that was quite a drive.  You slept all the way there.
Not bad.  I just won the State Lottery.
We dont even know you.
Me?
Nothing completely conclusive 
Technically and biologically though hell never recover.
No. No...we need to try our vaccine on it.
Incinerate it. Like the others.
No. Dont bother.
Yeah I did.
I came on my own. After reading about the bombing in Dallas.
Michaud was a patriot. The men hes loyal to know their way around Dallas. They blew that building to hide something. Maybe something even they couldnt predict.
You said the firemen and the boy were found in the temporary offices of the Federal Emergency Management Agency. Why?
Yeah well I dont have them all.
Ive been using you?
I told you  he and I were old friends 
Your ass? I just got chased across Texas by two black helicopters.
What happened to playing a hunch?
The element of surprise Scully. Random acts of unpredictability. If we fail to anticipate the unforeseen or expect the unexpected in a universe of infinite possibilities we find ourselves at the mercy of anyone or anything that cannot be programmed categorized or easily referenced...
No you didnt.
Im in the vending room.
Mulder. Move away from the door. Were coming through it.
I meet with the OPR day after tomorrow for remediation and reassignment...
Theyre not doing this Mulder.  I left behind a career in medicine because I thought I might make a difference at the FBI. When they recruited me they told me women made up nine percent of the bureau. I felt this was not an impediment but an opportunity to distinguish myself. But it hasnt turned out that way. And now if I were to be transferred to Omaha or Wichita or some field office where Im sure I could rise it just doesnt hold the interest for me it once did. Not after what Ive seen and done.
According to this tag.
Youre telling me the cause of death on the report is false. That this man didnt die from an explosion or from flying debris.
Were being blamed for these deaths. Scully I want to know what this man died of. Dont you?
It looks pretty green for this climate.
All the equipment is brand new.
I dont know Mulder.
Thats the first question to answer if were going to find them.
 of what exactly?
Pounding down some dirt road in the middle of the night. Chasing some elusive truth on a dim hope only to find myself standing right where I am right now at another dead end 
I hear the humming. Like electricity. High voltage maybe.
I dont know.
Were close to something here  were on the verge 
I need you on this Scully 
You saved me Scully.  As different and frustrating as its been sometimes your goddamn strict rationalism and science have saved me a thousand times have kept me honest and made me whole. I owe you so much Scully and you owe me nothing.  I dont want to do this without you. I dont know if I can. If I quit now they win.
I think youre in anaphylactic shock 
General McAddies.
But its not the lives we saved. Its the lives we didnt.
I breached protocol. I broke contact with the S.A.C. I ignored a primary tactical rule and left him alone with the device.
A simple unstoppable lifeform. What is a virus but a colonizing force that cannot be defeated? Living in a cave underground until it mutates. And attacks.
Thats why you bombed the building. The infected firemen the boy 
No one believes Kurtzweil or his books. Hes a toiler. A crank.
You need not kill a man to destroy him.
Why not?  Just once.  A trial run.  What harm could it do?
Yes but youre a willing participant. Picture Edward in a strange place lost frightened...
And he might blame you for terrifying him.  That one moment could erase all youve accomplished.  And if that happened the trust he has in you is gone.
Disorientation nausea migraines hallucinations insomnia paranoia.
I dont need them anymore...
Give a kiss to Edward.
As far as I needed.
You dont know the procedure.
Just like we all have fantasies right? Things only we know that we dont share.
Dont you feel there are different sides to every personality?  Maybe even the worst of us is capable of one decent act.  Were all human.
Little boy?  Thats him
Give her a minute.  Hello Valentine.
All yours.  My boss says its one of the strangest requests the Bureaus ever had.
No problem.
Whats wrong?
Shes bringing Stargher into hers.
Yes.  But youre going to sit down right now.  I have to...
Thanks you.  Six weeks off does a body good.  I heard she got the approval to try the reversal with Edward.
Awaiting his arrival.
Its his dog.
Lets give old Carl a call.  Tell him hes got company.
Ja ja ja.
Do you understand German?
I was talking to another friend of Harrys. A Baron Kurtz  do you know him?
In German?
Comedy. I dont play tragedy.
Whats that?
Oh let me see. No no thats not the cue. It means she has to sit down.
Im so sorry.
Be sensible  tell Major Calloway.
Why?
I knew him for twenty years  at least I thought I knew him. I suppose he was laughing at fools like us all the time.
There isnt enough for two laughs.
Oh...
How did you know I would be here?
I saw him today.
Why are you lying?
If you want to sell your service Im not willing to be the price... I loved him. You loved him. What good have we done him. Look at yourself they have names for faces like that.
Thank you.
We loved each other do you mean that?
Two weeks ago.
I dont know.
I dont want it.
Just around the corner.
Holly Martins.
I cant say that I have.
What are you trying to say?
Calloway  Im English not Irish.
Getting around Martins.
Calloway.
I see.
Shes right. Its none of my business.
You all did.
I said you win.
Two thirty.
Oh Mr. Martins...
Ill tell you what Mr. Martins. On Wednesday night at our institute we are having a little lecture on the contemporary novel...I thought perhaps youd like to speak.
Nonsense. Your novels are very popular here. Arent they Sergeant?
Goodness thats awkward.
Good evening Mr. Crabbin.
Oh I thought you would know youre a writer. Of course you do. Good night old man.
Of course of course of course.
Yes Hindu dances thank you Sergeant. This is the first opportunity weve had of making an American author welcome.
Very popular. Are you staying long?
Yes.
Its good to see you Holly.
I remember when they raided the gambling joint  you know a safe way out...
Only his doctor Dr. Winkel.
Whats the good of another post mortem? Suppose you dig up something  well  discreditable to Harry?
Vinkel.
I understand...
Mr. Lime  yes.
und ich kann nicht alle kennen.
You saw it?
Yes.
Funny?
Help you out?
Im sorry I dont think so.
I wouldnt know anything about that sir.
Yeah OK. Forget it. We wont tell anyone.
So how many miles do you think it is?
I dont know just a fin. Over there. About a hundred meters.
Yes.
Nothing. I just thought you ought to know.
Im sorry.
Fuck off.
Eh  bonsoir.
Hi there. Here take a look.
Sorry. I thought I was doing quite well.
If its too far then well drown. But if we dont try then well never know.
We have free will and intelligence  which God allegedly gave us....
I do I follow it. But okay say God provided the ram. So what? Once Abraham raised the knife in his heart it was as if hed killed him. He could never forget that. And neither could Isaac. Look at him hes traumatized hes a putz for the rest of his life. By the end he cant tell Jacob from Esau....
Then let Him destroy me now. Let Him crush me like the conceited bully He is.  Go ahead. Kill me. Here I am. Do it
The Zionists arent Nazis.
They sound like you.
Are you shitting me?? Right in the store?
Then I wont bring you....
Yeah. Hes a respected scholar. Even Noam Chomsky says he 
Fire...
No you dont.... If you hated them youd study them so youd know why you hate them. You know what tefillin is? Tsitsis? Shotness? You know the kaddish from the kiddush?  Eichmann? He went to Israel. He studied the Torah the Talmud the Mishnah the whole bit. He hated Jews.
I have a job.
I dont care about money.
Nobody reads that stuff anymore.
Too Christian. You know Jameson? Paul Virilio?
At first no one will know why the victims are being killed.
You want it to be an event.
Yes I am. Basically I am.
Oh really?
Then how come youre talking to me?
I stole it. From a synagogue.
That was a later invention its not in the scrolls.... Anyway the Jews know where the sentences end. They know the whole thing by heart. Every word. Every letter.
No.
What do you care?
Whats it mean?
Why?
Why not?
Even though his dick is so big?
Vasitem...
Nothing but nothingness...Judaisms not about belief.
Judaism doesnt even need God. You have the Torah the law. Thats your fucking God....  The books closed.
Its all you talk about. Jewish Jewish Jewish. Nobody talks about it that much except the Jews.
Cause he wasnt a rabbi.
And be crushed.
You gotta get out of here.
I dont. I was just curious how full of shit you were.
Whos Eichmann??
Its a romantic movement Curtis. It always has been.
Ive been waiting all my life for something like this.
Sexuality??? What do you mean?
Does that mean the Jew is the better lover?
He says you were bar mitzvahed there in March 1988.
So youre saying its not true.
Listen to me....
Yes. Infinitely more. They would become as God.
No.
Get the fuck away from me.
The arguments anyway.
With the shoes... There was more than one?
A fortyfive.
Fucking kike.
Its German.
From the Rhineland originally.
Curtis is afraid youll marginalize us.
Fine.
That damn thing. You know how it made me look...?
Itll be enough if we use it right.  Okay the servicell go about another hour. Say an hour for the janitors then one more just to be safe... Well go in at midnight.
Seventhirty tomorrow evening.
Yeah hey howre you doing...
Wow thats uh...great...
Four. But no one this important.
Okay thats it. Youre going back to 
Dennis Leary.
No.
Funny?
And thats when the Mets started to stink.
As you know Cindy thirteen is a mystical number in the Jewish faith. We believe that God has thirteen attributes...
Curtis is always more complicated than he seems. Even now.
Yes.  Not like Enzo.
But your man isnt quite a God
Sorry.  Of course not definitely not... well maybe a little.  What did you say?
Like a popsicle.  Theyre keeping him on a stick until spring.
... So am I.
I came to make a clean breast of everything... the whole business.
Yes isnt it wonderful?  Im so happy.  Ill bet Im the happiest pregnant fired person in the world
Hello
In a lake.
No its the recipe for spaghetti Frutti del mare.  You see I was right in getting you out here.  Youre a world champion my friend
I wont I swear.
No.  Jacques is a creature of the sea.  He isnt meant to live on earth among us... You should know this Johana.
You really think so?  Did you tell him you were pregnant?
The fool was asleep  If I werent around hed already be dead Is that who you want to live with?
Very chic.  Anyway you dont have anything else do you?
I didnt say...  Brussels
Its nothing.  Its just the helium because of the air pressure.
What room have you got?
Yes of course.  Lots of questions.
Me neither cause of my Mother. Shes a curse my Mamma a tornado. Stubborn as a mule  I was engaged... for a week.  After that Mamma was so mad I tell you pasta was bouncing off the walls.
Exactly I mean after all were men
No... It depends... Sometimes they are... What exactly do you want to know?
... Yes.
Long enough to die.  Listen if you really want to die thats your problem but dont do it under my nose okay?
... I was right about what?
... Okay.  Ill try.
I thought it was a nice place.  Isnt it?
I guess... But you know... Im American and Ive mostly been taught to be competitive... Theres always pleasure of being the best?
Uh... Yes of course
I did?
Im not from the sea... I dont understand what youre talking about.
Im still here.
... Its hard you know.  Youre so far away and I dont know what else to say.
... Nothing.
You go back Ill walk.
... The feeling of slipping without falling... The hardest is once you are at the bottom.
Because you have to find a good reason to come back up again... And I always have a hard time finding one.
Uncle Louis this is my friend Johana.
He doesnt hear too well.
Well... here.
Actually his days of marital infidelity have long since past. Now he just shtoops my mother exclusively.
Mordechai Santa Claus has been rubbed out by his son Damian. The mans a demon. Theres no telling what this new anti semitic psycho Santa is capable of.
He must be behind that curtain. Relax. Were undercover. We need to give off the appearance of calm. You see Esther the trick to undercover work is to try and blend in. Act as a Gentile would.
Cmon follow me.
No. Its not like that. Youre being completely neurotic. I was just playing along...
When I play bridge with all the girls everyone has what to talk about with their sons. They show pictures. Their sons are lawyers and doctors and Rabbis. Why cant I show a picture?
No. No. Were gonna argue. And you know what mom? Im going to save Hanukkah just to spite you. And when my face is all over the television. When your friends are opening their Hanukkah gifts next year dont mention it to them okay? I wouldnt want you to have to show my picture.
Mom why dont you put that cat out of its misery?
Mazel Tov
I wanted to ask you how were you able to pinpoint the exact location of Santas workshop? Weve been trying to gain that piece of surveillance for years.
But wait theres more. With a few swift clicks of this handcomputer interface commonly referred to as a mouse I can download illicit pornographic material and even send it along to a friend via a cyber postal route known as email.
Just praying to god that we dont kill ourselves going over this wall.
The alarm will trigger if the system detects any NonW.A.S.P. tendencies inside the building. For example if you were to dribble a basketball or eat watermelon or use the word dawg...that is spelled with an aw as opposed to the letter o...within the confines of this workshop the alarm would sound.
Offscreen gunfire. That Jewish Atomic Clock stuff ate up a lot of our budget.
Everythings kosher. Watch him for me.
If you keep your mouth shut and come with me you wont get hurt.
Why not?
I dont know 
You know  not scared enough. Nothing to scare it.
Look Charlie just be patient. Ill fix everything. You dont want that cat anyway. It killed two people.
Youll meet a rich man and he will give you money.
Watch and see A day or a week  but certainly this month  you will have money from a man and then
Who?
You must say that you went to take some of the roses to your fathers grave...
Rosita  I have wondered 
Shes a local. When the dudes come out to New Mexico they went to wallow in Latin glamour. This is a bad town for blondes.
Youre lucky. I wish hed front page for me.
Good evening.
Sure  certainly  but whats that got to do with this?
Caged animals are unpredictable. Theyre like frustrated human beings. I cant answer your question.
It could be. Why would a man kill her? For what? It wasnt robbery. It wasnt a crime of jealousy or passion. She had no enemies.
Dont you want to see the rest of the exhibit?
Not I tell you. No
Why do yoampi accuse me? You dont know what youre doing  you dont understand  nobody understands 
Theres a little museum here in town. Theyve hired me to run it Weve some interesting exhibits of Indian arts and crafts. Its fun  and I like living here in New Mexico.
Im sure if you are as talented as you are charming Miss Walker you have nothing to worry about.
No  really I can see them  theyre coming now  turn off the lights 
Somethings wrong with this whole setup 
Let me get one thing clear. Did Galbraith make a direct accusation?
Kiki  he wont hurt you. Theres nothing to be afraid of.
I thought  is Kiki just going to walk on that floor tonight walk out cold before a bunch of gawks who think a Spanish twirler is the greatest thing in life. No. Not my favorite client. Shes going to make an entrance  this town will never forget.
Yeah.
Do they close up every year for this Processionist business?
Hes a nice guy. Vie ought to keep in touch with him.
Robles says it looks that way. Belmonte had already been there and left. They only missed each other by a few minutes.
Maybe there ought to be less racket and more us.
If thats being a softie  there are two of us.
Im no detective. I dont even know how to begin. All I know is I want to do something about all this.
Didnt you take your cut out of the closing check?
What You cant be 
We ought to dare to tell each other everything Kiki  you and I.
Maybe for the same reason that made someone somewhere not consider this a spot to build the Getty Museum...
You a tourist?
I am Lawrence sir. Mr and Mrs De Moraes majordomo. They are expecting you.
When will they be back?
You will have to ask Mr De Moraes that sir.  Would you like a drink while you wait?
Dial OOO on the telephone if you change your mind about the drink sir.
What... What are you talking about?
Excuse me?
Couldnt Nazi hunters do the job?
You do want me to keep the job dont you Mrs De Moraes?
Have you got a pen?
Why dont you ask when I left the Mondrian?
I didnt know my husband and Friedman knew each other. I just...  Do you think we spoke about it? Ive known for five years. Hes known Ive known for five years... But not once have we spoken about it. There are things one just doesnt speak about...
Think what you like. But dont presume to understand.
I didnt know who or what had happened to my brother yet Mr Lombard
Something like that.
Perhaps I did... Until fear turned into panic. Thats when he hit me and told me hed killed my brother... You dont know what youve done he said.  Were in deep trouble he said. We he said. We.  Wed both be killed if Friedman ever found out you were working for us he said. We had to stop you and Friedman meeting...
What are you doing? You cant. I...
Your flunkey said he was expected back tonight.
The dead can wait.
A call box? Thats odd. Where exactly?
A coffee and a couple of croissants.
Croissants. Like that...
Im fine standing thank you.
Lombard...  It will take a few days for the things I need to get here. Meanwhile Id sooner not draw police attention walking the streets like a hungry dog...
Yeah. Goodnight Emily.
Whos the guy? Whos the guy Nom de Dieu  Had the guy got a closer look at you or your number plate Id have had to kill him.
So who... Whos the man? Where is he?
Italian? The Mafia...?
Thatthat wont do. Thats not the way it goes. You saw it you tell it thats the way...
Emily...
Shell be alright. Shes tough...
This is a bad line.
What sort have you got?
What about an untrained pup white...
Tomorrow?
Where is the Austrian? Is Friedman the Austrian?
...On holiday?
Who?  Martin... Hes Martin...
The company. We all work for the company.
Another hotel. Down the road. Martin lives there. He took your money. Hes got a safe...  I need a doctor...
Ill call again.
Can I have the reception desk please.
I certainly did sir...
La what?
That are called Rommel or something I guess not that many. 
Oui bonjour Jean... Oui trs bien merci. Ditesmoi pourriezvous me dire si vous avez recommandmes services quelquun rcemment... Vous tes certain... Non non...  Je vous remercie... 
What are you up to eh Savieer? I mean not this but... Money passports a gun in a microwave? Who are you eh? Who are you?
May I ask if you are Jewish Mr Lombard?
Well I would have to point out that we could have dealt with that question when you called this morning Mrs Spitz. I wouldnt like to think Id kept you waiting for nothing.
He could indeed Mr Lombard. But had he done so I think he would have let us know about it.
Anything at all?
This one came back and was never seen again. I understand Friedman looked after him.
Look I dont think youre fully aware of what youre playing with here Mister. Whoever put you up to this either pays too well or misinformed you. Why dont you just tell me what it is you want so we can do business in a civilized manner eh?
This is the hotel supervisor Mr Lamont. Im terribly sorry to disturb you but theres been a mixup with our bookings which you might be able to help us resolve.
I dont recollect mentioning a friend.
Shut up
Did Leon tell you why he didnt want the police involved Rhian?
Do you know Leons parents names?
My sister... She lives in the next valley.
Yes...Youyoure not going to take Shiva away?
Tu sais o me trouver.
Figlio di puttana. Youre the French asshole who bumped off the London guys...
Fuck...
What do you think huh?
Shut up and walk...
Its a good guess...
Very generous of you all.  How much?
No.  I see the hand of Tremoille and Regnault and Yolande and you... and they are dirty hands.
Now?
How dare you stop me doing Gods will
How dare you tell me what God tells me to do
Jeanne youve been badly wounded...
Maybe their silence is a sign...? Maybe its a sign to go home?
You listen to your voices I listen to my heart.
Or maybe its Jeanne whos in a trap  her own trap  a downward spiral that she cant stop?
To marry you.
I would like to marry you.  But I have already promised myself... to God.
It would not be the same without you.
Not yet
I want to stay with you...
I made no such promise.  Sound the retreat for the night
And so I... I prefer my banner.
You held up your sword and flourished it about in the air? Like this?
... so you were in the middle of the battlefield with your sword in your hand waving it above your head... charging against the enemy screaming and yelling... fighting for your life... and you want us to believe that in the middle of all this excitement you never killed anyone?
Shes loyal to her king... its only to be expected that she...
Well what are you waiting for? Youve got a castle full of racks and ropes and pulleys  go and torture the bitch
Scared of a girl?
What about you?
I will hear you... but not now not here.
Yes.  They paid your ransom... tomorrow you will be transferred to their great castle at Rouen.
In a village called Domremy.
Not unless you hear my confession.
Not unless you hear my confession.
Many things...
I  I cant Jeanne... I cant hear your confession... Im sorry...
Buying her?
Wwwhat has that got to do with this Maiden?
Why do you have to be so bloodthirsty?  Do you enjoy it?  All that blood and noise and pain? Diplomacy is far more civilized... far safer... and far cheaper...
Im more interested in what he says not what he looks like.
I know... but the English want her very badly and I have to tell you that they are proving much more generous.
20000 gold crowns.
I must offer to the Duke.  I will give you his answer tomorrow.
I know...
For what?
Jeanne with respect  we cant just attack the Tourelles like that  its a very complicated matter and...
I know what Im doing so either lend a hand or go back to bed
We need another ten minutes...
Calm yourself Xaintrailles.  Now slowly.  Who has finally done what?
As long as she brings food and supplies shell be welcome.
Me too...
I dont think.  I leave that to God. Im nothing in all this Im just the messenger.
But the bridge has been pulled down
I care  And I care because God cares  All life is precious to God  even his  even yours and mine...
Maybe... I dont know... but first we have to confess...
So... bring up the reinforcements
Jeanne look behind you.
But my voices... they promised me...
No...
No...
Thats now what I meant...
I know but thats not the way things happened...
Yes but...
Hey my friend  Im glad to see your ugly damn face again
They will  and so will you if you go on swearing like that.
Id sooner die than use magic
... the smell of victory Jeanne Mmmmmmm  I love it
A few teeth... thats the price of his life?
I  I  I...
Theyre going to come and visit you in here?
I want to see that.  Do you mind if I stay... on the side?  I wont bother you.
Like... like the wind... and the clouds... and... the bells... and what about that sword lying in the field... that was a sign...
So your memorys coming back?
In His name??
I... I was defending myself as best I could  Everyone has the right to defend themselves dont they?  Or should I have let myself be killed?
Why are you doing this to me??  Do you get pleasure from hurting me?
Do you think this cross will protect you?
Do you think you are ready?
Are you willing to follow all His commandments?
I need to confess again.
Well no but... Jeanne are you happy at home?
Oh yes I play with them... lots...
Yes it is.
A singer. Her husbands an actor. I knew them well. Good people. Id like to talk to her.
Oh yes. I remember.
You know something? Meeting you like that was absolutely wonderful.
Wladek please.
How will we sleep?
Yes but sometimes Im still not sure which side of the wall Im on.
Whats happened?
I havent seen him.
Who told you?
That makes a change.
Youre out arent you?
I didnt grovel I asked him to help.
Pay him? With what? With what could I pay him? Every zloty I earn we spend on food
Yes so did the Germans.
Yes but what good did it do?
There are always notices going up.
I didnt know you were in the certificate business.
Cow
Pack Wladek theres no time.
God forbid
Stop it Wladek.
Dont thank me. Thank God. Its His will that we should survive. Well. Thats what we have to believe.
Tell me your name. Ill listen out for you.
That is good yes.
The Alps.
Ohhh ... dear. Not another word From the shock yes it would be.
Yes its unholy.
No no bible readers.
Ill be back.
Yes I thought that.
Te kawnarna paraikete mo te tahi hawlie 0 te whenna uci.  UNSUBTITLED
Ada says youre doing well with the piano?
They are washed.
Let us not discuss this further. I am very pleased....
She says its her piano and she wont have him touch it. Hes an oaf he cant read hes ignorant.
Hah youre very cunning Ada but Ive seen through you Im not going to lose the land this way. Wait here
Thats right.
Who told ya this guy was in here?
Whats the line on Visitation?
He wont know youre carryin it. Cmon you gotta help me out.
How bout you?  Ill give you the whole hundred
What are you talkin about?  We just took off the biggest score weve ever had.  We can do anything we want now.
Believe me the Mans gonna be real happy.  Looks like we cleared over ten grand this week.
Yeh Luther said you could teach me something.  I already know how to drink.
Why?
Well get by without em.
If we ever get to it.
Well we got some workin money anyway.
What do ya mean?
Did he say he wouldnt?
Wonder why he doesnt fly both ways.
Well give him the hook on the train and play him here.  You think I can get in that poker game Eddie?
See ya and raise three.
You scored blood money today Hooker.  You need a friend.
Then youll have to come up with another grand somewhere.
Yes a ticket to Chicago.
Wheres June today?
Where you goin?
And you expect me to come over just like that.
No.  Theyre just the only ones we know of.
Three grand on the black Jimmy.
I was afraid you werent gonna come. We havent got much time.
This is just a test.  The big one comes later.  Be careful with that though its all I got.
Not yet but...  Hey theres only a grand here.
Ill make parole.
If it works again tomorrow Ill have a half million in cash here by noon the next day.  We split 6040.
We missed him.
Wouldnt that be too bad.  Youd hafta move outa this nice office ya got.
Hell never do it.
No.
Right back to California.  Weve got to go home and rest up from our vacation.
You know how they are... sex...
Is that what it means?
Look  those are the first metals that came through. 
That is if its all right with you.
Help yourself.  Oh Tom show this gentleman... 
Oh Andy Andy
Its a piece of evidence thats worth a great deal more than that.
He wouldnt say.
tried him once 
Were at the Normandie for a couple of weeks.  Why dont you drop around?
What are you trying to tell me? That you did it?
Which way did she fall?
Hes been dead for three months.
Yes she would.
We were planning to be married right after Christmas.
Youre not missing much.  Hes cuckoo.
And he still wants to marry me
Better get home before it is.
Going to run him through the fluoroscope?
Not a thing.
I hope you wont talk that way to the police when they come here.
What are you talking about Gilbert? You werent there
We hear this is getting to be sort of a meeting place for the Wynant family so we figure well stick around in case the old man himself shows up.  Then we seen him...  ...sneak in and we decide to come up.  And pretty lucky for you.
Whatd he think it was to you?
Im asking you.
No.
Ill have to try to remember.
You mean about that gun?
I think were on the right track.
I never saw him.  I dont think anyone saw him.
When was that?
I see.
Why yes.
I dont think so.  Of course I was terribly upset...  I hardly knew what I was doing.
Let him have his say out.
Looks like he planned something. He shut up his apartment and his shop.
I guess all the suspects are here.
Maybe if you quit running around after other women you wouldnt have so much trouble with this one.
Hes not anybody.  Just a fellow I used to know.
What bonds?
Do you realize that youre accusing me of ....
supporting that gang of loafers Theres not one of them that cares a damn for you.  A wife who threw you out the first time your foot slipped.  They wouldnt raise a hand to help you.  And Ive given my whole life for you.  If you kicked off tomorrow whered I be? Out in the gutter  Sure I took those bonds.  Who has a better right  ?
Good morning. Im afraid this isnt a very Merry Christmas for you.
Would it help any if I could persuade him to meet you?
Never mind.
Is Julia going with you?
Thats all right.  What are you drinking?
I havent been a detective for four years.
What about it Tanner.  Isnt that the truth?
Hello Mimi.
Now Mimi there are a thousand detectives in New York.  Hire one of them.
I tell you again I dont want any part of it.  Now you take Dorothy home and...
Yes...
Gilbert  Is he here too?  We might as well be living in the lobby.
Ive got some very important news  Ive seen Wynant.
He didnt say very much.  Wanted to know how I was and how the children were.
And the murderer is right here in this room tonight... hes sitting at this table.  You may serve the fish.
Youre lying Mimi.  But then youd do anything for money.  Youre getting a good price for saying you saw Wynant and you figure you wont get anything if hes dead.
Macaulay you drew up Wynants will.  Mimi was cut off wasnt she if she remarried?
I didnt knock Julia off.
I wouldnt have any reason to hurt her.  She was always on the up and up with me.  But that dirty little Nunheim  he got sore cause I clicked with her and he didnt so he put the finger on me.
This is your party.
Hes welltrained.  Hell behave himself.
If you like em like that.
I was hoping I wouldnt have to tell you.  Dorothy is really my daughter.  You see it was Spring in Venice and I was so young.  I didnt know what I was doing.  We were all like that on my fathers side.
Much better thanks.
That last Martini.
What are you drinking?
Theres nothing I can do to help her.
Well quick  get into bed.  Are you all right?
Well didnt you?
Yes.  I know all they know about the murder. And Im a great hero. The Tribune said I was shot twice.
Im stifling but its so pretty.  The Kirbys.
Yes.
Lets see.  Wheres it from?
Your guess is as good as mine.
I dont believe he did it.
Looks like a holdup
I dont know...  This thing has got my goat. Ive got to find out.
You wouldnt be a widow long.
Not with all your money
I did find him
It was his body that was buried there.
Yup.  Dont you want something to eat?
Several things.  Hello Fred.  Were hungry again. Yeah and lots of onions.  Oh and coffee.
Oh.  Well the clothes for instance. They were carefully preserved and the body was just as carefully destroyed.  The person who killed him counted on one thing... that all skeletons look alike.
Got a nice evening dress?
Im afraid youre lying Mimi. You see I really did see Wynant last night.
His plan was still working beautifully. Wynant was established as being in town.  The watch chain was handed over....  ...with a slight delay...to the police. The only hitch was a man named Nunheim who had found out something.  Our hero paid Nunheim once to keep his mouth shut and when Nunheim threatened him again he bumped him off.
I had a key. I worked here... till they closed the shop.
Yes.
Two weeks work gone for nothing.
I dont care what you wanted to tell me.  Youre through  Get your things and get out
You did.
Not up to us.  Up to the Iraqis.  All they have to do is get out of Kuwait.
Were going to keep driving.
Wha...
You just go when I say go.
And find the treasure and get it and get back to the Humvee and get the hell out of Iraqi without getting our heads blown off but thats about it.
Probably was a couple of hundred years ago when whoever drew the map came through here.  Worn down to nothing now.
Let me see the map.
Youve had your say Wes.  Now leave it.
Maybe I do.
I told you.  He tried to steal our gold. He tried to kill us.
Suppose I dont go for that?
Look I know you guys are telling the truth.  Its just the Shiites dont know that.  I guess you could tell them...but then you dont speak the language do you?
Tell me something Wes.  Are you crazy greedy or just stupid?  Jaeger says youre crazy.
If I give it to you will you let us go?
Knock it off
Ready for what?  What are you supposed to be doing?
What were doing is kicking ass.  For Gods sake they got Iraqis surrendering to news crews.  The war is over.  Weve just got to keep shooting people cause the army spent all this money and weve got to put on a show for the taxpayers.
Roger that.
Oh thats fun.
Whwhat do you think
I didnt miss it.  I figured if you knew one of the reserves got hit youd want to turn back.
I heard it click.
Were going to get off all right.  Well get you off of there.  Just...be cool.
Me and Wes are just going to talk.
I said be cool all right?  Now be cool
Youre not going to let me die are you? Dont let me die
If we step on a mine well know it was. Let me see the maps.
The Shiites are on our side?  I didnt know that.
So good bye Shiites.  Thanks for playing.  We have some lovely parting gifts for you as you go.
Something like that.
Stay low.
Were not going to do anything.
So where do we start?
What does it look like Im doing?
Whats to stop him if he wanted to?  All he has to do is cut the line...
Jesus Jaeger.
Northeast?  Thats away from the Hummer further into Iraqi.
Well find our way.
Is it all right if I stand up?
Yeah.  Well me too.
Its got to be going better than this..
Its a desert.  Thats what deserts do at night they get cold.
No
Hell theyll probably just surrender to us.  Probably.
We keep going thats what we do.  We ignore them maybe they ignore us.
Shiites I think.
But...
Thought you were going to buy a car.
Hell slow down.
A headache?
Naw nothing.
Whats your point Wes?  You have a point?
What?
Come on man.  I almost had this thing open.
You know its real.  You know its real and you know its there.  You know it.
Hell well just buy our way out.
Oh no.
...I figured...I figured youd turn back.
You have to go with us.  You cant walk back...
Doesnt matter.  Were not going to be able to get him off it anyway.
Until were out of the mine field is how long.
That dont mean nothing.  Iraqis could have just spread them out like that make us think were in the clear.
We make it or we go back empty handed.
Just seems weird they didnt chase us.
Guess we know what the next stop is.
Hes a soldier.  He doesnt need a weapon.  Hes got rocks.  Hes got bare hands.
Correct.  Origin?
Vocasity
Well its fixed so youll have to eat it.
Eat your dinner.
Now.
I didnt.  You asked me about the card.  Youre going to get us into trouble.
Thats not food.  Cant be food.
What?...Oh no THX.  Thats not true.  Not satisfied?  THX I need you so much.
No  Dont go.
I dont want to lose you.
You dont know.  You dont....
No...No...
What are you talking about? When did you sleep last?  Do you know what your trouble is? Youre blind.  Youve been here so long you cant see what is happening.  We must unite.  We need unity.  We need action.  We have come to a time when we must....
THX and me.
I wonder how far he went.  Hes gathered invaluable information out there.
It may seem ridiculous to the untrained mind but if you were able to interpret the calculations you would see that an apparent paradox is actually a perfect and elegant system in concept and design.
Where is LUH?
I want you for my roommate.
What?
Look more closely.
Too late....stay close.
No......  Shes dead THX........
....going well.  How could I be so wrong.  SCO 1202 cross wired a 904.  Hes been receiving extra credit.  He offered me some.
My mate has been acting very strange.  I cant explain it.....but.  I havent been feeling very well myself.  I dont know maybe its me.  I needed an SP9 last night.  I feel as if something odd were happening to me. Something....
You are a true believer.  Blessings of the state blessings of the masses.  Thou art a subject of the divine.  Created in the image of man by the masses for the masses. Let us be thankful we have an occupation to fill.  Work hard increase production prevent accidents and be happy.

So youre the Device Squad... and you defuse devices?
Anything else I should know?

Easy guys.  
Call upstairs see what you can find out.
T.J. run a trace on this see if you can pin down where it came from. Whoever these people are lets hope theyre all talk.
We work fast enough for you?
Exactly my thinking. Except none of the targets can actually be linked to government political or special interest concerns. They seem to be just unrelated industrial companies. Some insured some not. 
Hope you dont mind Captain might help us catch these guys that much sooner.  Coming?
Lets get something straight. Were doing you a favor. Youre not exactly a guy we want around explosives.
Megs lasagna. Good eats Reilly. Cmon.

Yup. Thats one of the great things about Paris. Lots of girls willing take their clothes off.

Fantastic idea Mr. Bond Perhaps I should buy it for a book Its totally preposterous but   You amuse me. ...And now perhaps I can amuse you.
Goodbye Mister Bond.
Did you test the autopilots? The satellite positioning receiver?
I appreciate your time 
Ah James. You always were a cunning linguist... Au revoir mon cher.
Guard Arrest these men Escort them to the cutter
Yes. The famous James Bond. Ive heard all about you sir. You were under direct orders to act as an observer  and yet you had to go off on your own like some halfassed CIA cowboy   Endangering the gold attracting that lunatic woman and then putting in a distress call for us to save your bloody hide.
Is this another one of your games?
No Hes crazy  hes insane. He hates everybody. Hes got these plans   Youve got to help me James. Im sorry. Im sorry for everything. I know I was wrong  but youve got to protect me. I know you still love

Political considerations?
Qs retirement party. Id just put the knife into the cake and 
I see...
If you cant do the time dont do the crime?
Hey  the world is my office.

I envy your undercover assignments.
I wonder if you handle your liquor more carefully than you handle your boat.
I hope so.
He was my fathers best friend
The only mistake is that they didnt kill us in the elevator.
Up.
... We have time for that?
...You know thats another reason youre probably not in a successful relationship.
Now.
I have an excellent teacher.  Make sure you wear the uniform?
Jashwa tsway. These are lips.
Fifteen seconds. Perhaps you should consider hiring an attorney.
Ayeaye sir. Engines to half.
Excellent.
Approaching the first gate.
Entering the main tunnel  ten minutes to target 
No sir I swear This is not true
I dont know. Hes not in the database 
I hadnt forgotten. I ordered some cloth but it didnt come in and I felt so bad if I would have come to her birthday without that I just stayed at home.
You all dont believe me when I tell you Im afraid of heights.
Why are you always afraid to get somewhere?
I dont see you crying about my drinking it.
I preached to Mom and Dad about it but they are stuck in their ways its like talking to a brick. But if there is a way...
Babe Brother.
Ive heard some foolish things in my life.
Dont make me raise my hand to you. You have to see for yourself that you are going in the wrong direction.
Anytime you need someone to do something for you just let me know.
We grow most of our own food. The money I get from social security my pension and my wifes work keeps us living on the edge. What choice do people like us have.
Hush.
Hush.
It would be nice.
No Im too hot now.
What happened to your hand?
I dont want to hear any joke about colored people being in hell. Youre being irreverent.
He kind of favors one of my boys when he was about his age.
Im going to wash up now. You all please excuse me.
I was going to get up and get a hen out there for dinner but time got away.
It was slow. Now it seems like everyone is having births at home.
Course you could be right. Your sons are alive. All my sons are dead.
You should go back and rest.
Tolerable well.
You just run along. Ill fix him his soup. He will be all right.
Im glad you brought that up as to who you are. I have to know who is in my house.
Week by week the crowds at the door keeps getting larger. We cant feed all the hungry.
Why run out and close the barn door when the horse is gone? I remember when you werent saved. That was way back yonder when the Natchez Trace was just a dirt road.
Out of weariness I spoke to my own heart to leave it all and to die. And I gave my heart to know madness and folly.
Ya but you cant do the shuffle with one leg. You and your wife in your spare time work with the less fortunate. Now Im not talking about you and what you do but some folks that always run to help the victim deep down are attracted to pain and suffering and love to be near the dying.
Everybody who have been associated with Harry end up with pennies over their eyes.
Dont shout
Whether the boy hears it or not the man is still a jackass. Everyone should have some mother wit.
Whadda ya think?
Now go get Molly.  Your friends are going to be here any minute.
Oh yeah
You can bring ONE toy...
No I havent seen him.
But Mom I cant find him
Sure  Ill even let you drive.
But what if we leave them behind?
Lets let Molly open one.
Watch yourself
Okay then Mr. Lightbeer  Prove it.
That wasnt flying  That was falling with style
Where?
Nothing that concerns you spacemen. Just us TOYS.
But were not on my planet are we?
YOU are the one that decided to climb into this 
Oh great great.  Yeah and if anyone attacks us we can blink em to death.
Ill tell you whats  AAAAH
Oh you idiot  Youre a toy  Use your karate chop action
Hey  Hey  How are you doing that? Stop that
Dont you get it?  You see the hat? I am Mrs. Nesbit 
Come on Sheriff.  Theres a kid over in that house who needs us. Now lets get you out of this thing.
Weve got to get out of here...NOW.
Woody

Sorry there old Spudhead.

Just stay where you are Corporal Dont move Carl.  Youll blow up. I know youre tired  I know your leg is cramping but you cant move. Do you hear me?
Huh?
Got it.
Excuse me.
I didnt know about the puppets. Its a lot to take in all at once.
Home is where the heart is.
Get away from me...
Is that all?
Finn 
It was only a mouthful
So did I.
So had I.
Is she in any kind of therapy... professional help?
I cant find Manolo.
He has debts.  He has gambling debts. He owes a lot of money.
I want to believe you.  I really do.
Arnie this is crazy.
Arnie I feel like Alice stepping through the looking glass.
Its the same.  What happened to what they gave you?
I just didnt want to take a chance. I didnt want to risk it.  It could have been frozen along with everything else.
Honey this is difficult but weve all had our moments.  I tried 
Six months.  I found some marijuana thats all.  And a little pipe about two inches long.  I talked with her. She said her friends smoked pot and drank 
Does this mean youre going to be gone more?
The first thing we have to do is present a unified front.
Not yet.
I keep feeling like Im forgetting something.
We watched his father get dragged away by federal agents.  I dont even know how to begin to tell him where you are or when youre coming back... Or if youre coming back.
How?  Supportive letters from prison while Im being kicked out of our home?  Do you have any idea what is happening out here?  Our credit cards are maxed. The people at the bank you should see their faces when I walk in there. I have a letter from the government telling me that anything I sell from our house will be taken against an income tax lien.  Our friends are behaving like the crowd at a public hanging.  Nobody will help us.  Nobody will take us in.  Nobody wants anything to do with us.  So tell me Carl how youre gonna make it up to me.  Tell me again how well get through this and maybe while youre at it you can put your hand up against the glass so we can have a tender moment of connection.
Will we get invited to the White House?
Yes.
Yeah.
What is this like freebase?
I feel good.
She aint in on it.
I love my job.  I love it.  The next time Im having a bad day you gotta remind me of right now and Ill get over it.
Oh man Ive never eaten so good in my life.  Why dont you develop a useful skill?
Were playing
Im on a special phone may I speak freely?
Theres always a way.  If people get to the Pope or the President you can get to him.
Nobody said shit Eduardo 
You cant visit me here.  I want my lawyer.
Carl and I were friends from childhood.  He was loyal thats not a mistake.
Thats crazy.  My husband is on trial for smuggling.
They wouldnt do it in front of all these people.  Theyd send someone later when were alone.
Shes nosy.  She hears me on the telephone.
The police wont find your car.
Then I guess Im going by myself.
What?
Javier Rodriguez.
Its possible.
Any idea how much?
I have money 
Ill pay you a thousand dollars.  I have it in my wallet.
She hasnt called you?
We sometimes went downtown to score.
You want to help?  Stay the fuck away from her.
Addicts treat themselves... they overdose and then theres one less to worry about.
Agents who died in the field.
What do you mean?
Your dads a doctor.  Call him 
No. On you go.
Bit fucking late like.
Because I fucking told you to do that you doss cunt.
You daft cunt. If youre going to waste it like that you might as well leave it all to me. Now get the drinks in.

Four kilos. Thats what  Ten years worth? Russian sailors? Mikey Forrester? What the fuck are you on these days? Youve been to jail Spud so whats the deal  like it so much you want to go back again?
For four fucking grand?  One palm tree a couple of rocks and a sewage outflow.

Because its illegal.
Easy for you to say.
Are you clean?
Too young for what?
Unless you get caught.
Well hes young and hes healthy.
What and deny myself the only pleasure I get from him? Did I tell you about my birthday?
Itll be here somewhere. I might have returned it by mistake.
Oh yes indeed. I look back on my time there with great fondness and affection. The debating society the first eleven the soft know of willow on leather 
Oh really?
Exactly. Those very words have been my guiding light in what is after all a dark and often hostile world.
You were referred here by the Department of Employment. Theres no need for you to get you foot in the door as you put it.
Its no problem.
No problem.  No problem  easy to say when its some other poor cunt with shite for blood.
Nightmare.
Lewis Gilbert.
But youre looking better it has to be said. Healthier. Radiant even.
Thats your theory?
It wasnt my baby. She wasnt my baby. Baby Dawn. She wasnt mine. Spuds? Swanneys? Sick Boys? I dont know. Maybe Allison knew. Maybe not. I wished I could think of something to say something sympathetic something human.
And I got a stitch stuck between my teeth jerked my head back and the whole fucking stump fell off.
Fuck you.
It was just an idea.
Theres a mate of swanneys. Mikey Forrester  you know the guy. Hes come into some gear. A lot of gear.
Four Grand.

It is I.  The journey you undertook to reach me could not have been an easy one.
And how did you breach the Barrier?
You doubt me?
Is there a problem gentlemen?
Then its fortunate that I have you and your starship to protect me. In the meantime Captain Chekov I instruct you and your First Officer to beam down to my coordinates.
Enterprise this is Starfleet Operations. Come in.
With all due respect the Enterprise is a disaster. There must be other ships in the quadrant.
The power was within you.
Join my quest.
What you seek. What all men have sought since time began  ultimate knowledge. But to find it well need a starship.
I think you gave me too much time Captain.
Why didnt you beep my communicator?
Put it on the veiwscreen would You please?
Put it on the screen.
Captain were receiving transmission from Paradise City. Theyre demanding to know our intentions.
Go Sulu.
Goodnight Doctor.
I cannot be certain.
Who is it he reminds you of?
Fascinating.
Yes Captain?
Captain what have I done 
If you think it would help.
If I had pulled the trigger Sybok would be dead.
Technically you are correct. I do not have a brother.
I have a half brother.
The designers tested it using the most intelligent and resourceful person they could find. He failed to escape.

It was not my intention to amuse you. These are serious charges. However if you surrender now
Do you?
No. You must save yourselves. Forgive me brother. Forgive me.
You havent told him?
I still dont get why youre trying to break into the system.
Yeah. Tryin to find the file and erase it. Once thats gone aint nothin can stop him. Just Eddie and his Master Control Program runnin things from on high..
Boy if we were inside I know how to forge us a Group 6 access...
Nah...I decided...Ive had enough of video games to last me a good long time. I feel like gettin into some real life...
Flynn had access to you too. Im not interested in talking about him.
You call that getting over it?
Im certainly not.
Well you have to expect some static. Computers are just machines after all they cant think...
Alan. Alan Bailey.

So... Nice ship you got here. Whats our next move?
Now wait a minute  I wrote you.
Im sorry Walt. So much pressure lately... you feel like going for a drink?
I... have come to communicate with my User.
Hah.
Greetings program...
How about you?
Oh I was an actuarial program... worked at a big insurance company. It really gives you a great feeling helping folks plan for their future needs  and of course if you look at the payments as an annuity over the years the cost is really
Yeah but Im remembering all kinds of stuff. Like...my User wants me to go after the MCP
We have to talk.
Thats right. He pushed me...in the other world. Somebody pushes me I push back. So I brought him down here ... Whats the matter Sark? You look nervous.
Now get this straight pal  no one User wrote me. Im worth a couple million of their manyears Im bigger than all those little wimps put together  Humans they cant even keen their social order in one piece
You rather take your chances with me? Want me to slow down your power cycles for you?
Well get them sir... These things take time.
We have to.
I have to find out what Alan wants... that comes first.
Oh Tron... I knew youd escape... theyve never built circuit that could hold you...
Power surge... the transmission beams too strong
Im shocked.
Just an hour?  You should tell this stud to take more time.
Out.  If Dad doesnt care enough about us to be here on his birthday then why should I care? Im going to a movie.
Great  Youre going to believe that fat dweeb Mr. Hardy over your own daughter.

Fine.
Honey that song came out in 1968 when I was exactly your age.

Hardcore highly fanatical ultra fundamentalist.  Linked to numerous carbombings that cafe bomb in Rome and the 727 out of Lisbon last year.  Major player.
You want me to just hang ?

Helens phone.  Her office line and the line at my house.
Sure Harry.  Im on it.
There is only one solution to your problem Mrs. Tasker.  You must work for us.
Lets go.  Ill brief you in the air.
... the Coast Guard has to clear them back to a twenty mile radius.  Anybody that cant make the minimum safe distance we need an airlift on immediately
Sorry.
But hes not exactly ringing your bell lately right?  I mean
Yes sir.
Thats right.  They want something...  dramatic.  I spoke to a number of people who said youre the one to see.
Those wimps.  Its because I use my diplomatic contacts to export cultural treasures from countries which tell them to take a hike.  I told you to move those crates an hour ago.  Come on guys lets get going.
Yeah.  You should have seen it. We were the hit of the show with the new model ordering system the one for the 680... how you can write up an order and the second the customers name goes into the computer it starts checking their credit and if theyve ordered anything in the past and if they get a discount...
I slept with him and he knocked off a hundred bucks.
Ill handle it.
Its okay dont bother Harry.
Ill just be a second.  So what happened tonight at the office?
No.
Harry?  What can I say about Harry?  Hes a sales rep for a computer company.
No.
No one must know  Especially him.  You must appear to live your life normally conveying nothing.  The security of this nation depends on it.  Can you do that?
The code name of your contact will be Boris.  Your code name will be
What?  Oh the flat tire?  Yeah I thought the damn towtruck was never going to get there.
Sodium amytal maybe some other truth agent.
What about Juno?
What?
No.  Much more.
Wait here.  If you have to use this use it.  Dont choke. Okay?
So whats your angle?
What about the husbands?
Some kinda legal secretary of something.  Married to some boring jerk.
Let me think about it.  Hold it a day for me?
You son of a bitch.  Did you really think you could elude us forever Carlos?
Go ahead.
No my dear he is a federal agent.  He killed two of my colleagues the other night.
Samir is just going to ask Harry a few questions.  See were not even sure which agency Harry works for.  Now Samir is absolutely first class but on the other hand we have Harry here who has managed to lie convincingly to the woman he loves for 15 years.  So it will be interesting to see how long he can resist.
Something you obviously have a hard time doing
Its strange.  I knew I was in a womans thoughts when I was shooting it out with those assassins.
I just glances inside.
Find out who this Renquist it.
Yeah my roommate leaves it on the TV.
Knock wood.
The letter he sent.
Ya looked through it?
Yeah. Im fine. It didnt hurt.
Its OK. Dont worry about it. Accidents happen.
Is that your real name? Really?
I took a cab.
What time is it?
Theres nothing to tell.
What do you do?
Would you like a bite of my pie?
Five.
Youre not stupid. Just wrong.
Clarence Ive got something to tell you. I didnt just happen to be at the theater. I was paid to be there.
What?
You will?
What?
No joke. This is probably the best hamburger Ive ever had. Im serious Ive never had a hamburger taste this good.
What?
That rhymes.
Heard that.
You dont like it but you eat that shit.  He eats it.
With that sonofabitch walkin around breathin the same air as you? And gettin away with it every day. Are you haunted?
Then shoot em. Shoot em in the face. And feed that boy to the dogs.
I was dying. I thought for sure everyone could see it on my face.
Are you kiddin? He loves you.
Tell him well be hittin his area some time tomorrow.
Ask him if he got the letter.
You goin out?
I certainly hope so.
Its difficult because youre sellin it to a particular group. Big shots. Fat cats. Guys who can use that kind of quantity. Guys who can afford two hundred thousand. Basically guys I dont know. You dont know. And more important they dont know you. I did talk with one guy who could possibly help you.
Hardly anything. I wasnt sure from your letter what was bullshit and what wasnt.
Elliot Blitzer.
The zoo.  What are you waiting for?
Two guys.
Dont expect me to be all broken up over poor Drexl. I think he was a fuckin freeloadin parasitic scumbag and he got exactly what he deserved. I got no pity for a mad dog like that. I think I should get a merit badge or somethin.
Yeah lets just get outta here.
I dont blame you.  So wed both fuck Elvis. Its nice to meet people with common interests isnt it?
Ha ha ha. No really where does it come from?
He trusts you?
Sure. I didnt hear anything.
Yeah?
You know I saw it on the stands my first inclination was to buy it. But I look at the price and say forget it its just gonna be the same old shit. I ended up breaking down and buying it a few days later. Man I was ever wrong.
I can see what you mean.
Now thats bullshit Lee. Every time you buy one of those little movies its a risk. Im not sellin you something thats gonna play two weeks six weeks then go straight to cable. This is Doctor Zhivago. Thisll be packin em in for a year and a half. Two years Thats two years you dont have to work with anybodys movie but mine.
Im not satisfied till the spoon stands straight up.
Anything stronger?  Oh probably not. Beer? You can drink beer cant you?
Uh yeah... theres a party store down 54th.
Clarence just shut up youre giving me a headache I cant believe how much like your mother you are. Youre your fuckin mother through and through. I havent heard from ya in three years. Then ya show up all of a sudden at eight oclock in the morning. You walk in like a goddamn bulldozer... dont get me wrong Im happy to see you... just slow it down. Now when did you get married?
Thats what Ive been tellin ya. The guy was like a mad dog. So the cops arent looking for me?
I got some money I can give you 
Sure.
McTeague.
I dont see why not. When you gonna come round and see my new place?
Step inside.
Absolutely.
Uhhuh.
I believe he believes him.
We talked him into it.
No dont sit here and feed us some shit.
But there is a bright side though. If you ever have to play a part of a guy who gets fucked in the ass on a daily basis by throatslitting niggers youll have so much experience to draw on 
To front for him. So Elliot is workin out the deal between them and his boss a big movie producer named Lee Donowitz.
How the fuck could he know?
Whatta we gonna do? Hes in an elevator.
This guys gonna kill him.
Look here. If I ever did eat some pussy  I would never eat any pussy  but if I did eat some pussy I sure as hell wouldnt tell no goddamn body. Id be ashamed as a motherfucker.
Why you trippin? We jus fuckin with ya. But I wanna ask you a question. You with some fine bitch I mean a brick shithouse bitch  youre with Jayne Kennedy. Youre with Jayne Kennedy and you say Bitch suck my dick and then Jayne Kennedy says First things first nigger I aint suckin shit till you bring your ass over here and lick my bush Now what do you say?
No way Jos.
Naw they aint stayin here. But I know who youre talkin about. Theyre stayin at the Hollywood Holiday Inn.
Uh what?
For a man in your position...an opportunity.
This is it James...what youve been working for.
Shut up
Hey no problem its probably just another kidnapping featuring Jeffreys shrink pardon me make that exshrink.  This is your leader a certifiable lunatic who told his former psychiatrist all his plans for God knows what whacko irresponsible schemes and now who knows what shes painted out there on our wall?
It was released in Philadelphia probably on June 14 1995.
So that...???
I need to go now.
July?
1995?
Perhaps it was a wrong number...
No more drugs.  Please...
Ohhhh that one  Can we hear that one?
We dream about whats important in our lives. And I seem to have become pretty important in yours.  What was the dream about?
And I was in it?  What did I do?
Nevermind.  Its not real  its a hoax.  A prank.  Hes hiding in a barn. Hey turn left here.  Left
Jeffrey Mason?
You know Dr. Masons son Jeffrey Mason dont you James?  You met him in the County Hospital six years ago.
Jeffrey Mason said it was my idea about the virus.  And suddenly I wasnt sure.  We talked when I was in the institution and it was all...fuzzy. The drugs and stuff.  You think maybe Im the one who wiped out the human race?  It was my idea?
James...do you remember...six years ago...you had a phone number  You tried to call and...
They got your message Kathryn.  They played it for me.  It was a bad recording...distorted.  I didnt recognize your voice.
If we cant change anything...because its already happened then we ought to at least smell the flowers.
No  Look I dont belong here  What I need to do is make a telephone call to straighten everything out.
Scientists.  Im supposed to report in to them.  Theyll want to know they sent me to the wrong time.
Whats that mean?
You do know me.  You helped me once.
How did you find me?
The call I just made?  Five minutes ago?
Youre insane Jeffrey.
Might be tight.
Twelve Monkeys honey.  Guess you folks didnt turn on your radio this morning.
I dont know.  I thought you were keeping the sun from your eyes.
Thats cause hes dead.
Just cause I aint got eyes doesnt mean I cant see.
Or maybe you just think you do.  You can run just as far as you can but wherever you go there you are.
What do you want for free?
Aint over yet.  Night is part of day separate but equal.  Night is when you let your guard down when you see things in the shadows and hear things in the dark.
Well a man with some gumption.  How much money you got?
Will be.
It will.
I . . . Mexico.  You got a bus that goes to Mexico?  Thats where I have to go.
How much.
One way.
Im sorry sir.  Its thirty dollars for the ticket.
You Harlin?
Cause Harlin used to own it.
Look pal Ive got places to be. Could you just take a look at my radiator hose.  Its busted.
I know its busted.  What did I just tell you?
If I could do you think Id be standing here wasting my time.  Can you fix it or do I have to go somewhere else?
Twentyafterten.
Dont look like nothing.
Thats not just a Ford thats a sixtyfourandahalf Mustang.
Then you aint gonna have the car.
Thats a good piece of advice Darrell.
Whats the matter?  The fight gone out of you?  Im just gonna smash a headlight.  Maybe two.
There you go sweet talking me again.
It is morning.
Honest like Al Capone on tax day. Where are my keys?
You know how that Toby is.  Thinks every man he sees is after his Jenny.
They look nice.
Im just going to my car.
You sure you can manage?
Yeah my luck.  I get to be stuck out here in this hole in the desert.
I guess Ive got wander in my blood.
If youre going to gamble might as well play for high stakes.
A little of this a little of that. Mostly I tell fortunes.
Maybe I like to find out about a man first.  Maybe I like to know what hes made of.
Depends on what you call love.  When I was growing up I had nothing.  I learned to want everything.  I wanted more than Sierra anyway. Jake was my ticket.  Hes not much hes older than me different than me but hes got more money than half this town put together.  I courted him.  I let him think he was courtin me but I reeled him in like a fish on a line.  I wanted him.  I wanted what he could give me and I wouldve done anything to get him.  Is that love?
From?
I . . . nothing.  Just something he said.  So if the moneys in a safe wed have to get the combination
If the keys on him to get the key wed have to . . .
Its not like hes a young man. Hes had time to live.
Because I know youre full of shit.
I dont know.
I . . . nothing.  I just stubbed my toe on a rock.  Hurt like hell . . . thats all.
Yeah.  Good thinking.
Funny thing.
Grace  Just . . . let me handle this.  Sheriff Im telling you theres nothing in that trunk.  If thats not good enough for you then Id be happy to open it.  Just as soon as you get yourself a search warrant.
Thirtythousand thats all.  We would have been free and clear.  You didnt have to kill him.
But I want to say with you
I dont want to go to Mexico John. I want to be with you.  Dont you think I care about you?
Grace
You closed it didnt you Grace?
Walk to where?  Were fifty miles to the nearest town.  Its going to be over onehundred degrees today.  How far do you think youre going to get?
Im her husband.
Yeah I know.  More careful.
Got work.  I know a man whos got a boat.  Wants me to sail it for him.
How do you know if youve never tried?
Just ran into a little trouble.
No.
No.
I was hoping we could talk.
That was just loose talk.  I dont want anybody dead.
This morning I didnt know how badly Id want to get out of this fucking town.
For that Id kill a nun on Easter Sunday.
Im not your boy Jake.  I dont like you and I dont like what you are.  I got no choice but to do business with you.  This is just a nasty little marriage of convenience.
And tell her what?
I know all right.  I know youre just enough of a shit to have a go at bedding a mans wife.  Youve probably bagged a few at that. Youd probably lie cheat and steal without thinking twice.  From that youd just turn and walk away.  But to kill to get that blood on your hands.  You cant wash that off. Youd be a marked man for life. Just like Cain.  And youre a sinner who wants to walk with the saints. Aint that right boy?
Came close this time and it scares you.
All I have in the world.
Theres another reason?  It better be good.
You came to take my wife from me?
Liar.
Christ Jake please
What are you . . . you cant . . . you cant kill me.
Think about it.  How do you think I got in here?  Did you hear any glass break?  Did you hear a door splinter?  How did the evening end? After you went to bed did she linger a bit?  Maybe just long enough to leave the back door unlocked?  Is that what happened?
What?
That country shit all sounds the same to me.
Ive had time to get over it.
Oz.
I wasnt going to fight for you.  I was just going to beat the shit out of your boyfriend.
Get it through your head little girl Im not going for you.  If this Toby likes you then if I were you Id marry him.  Youre not going to get much better in this town.
What the hell are you talking about?
Will you shut up
You know who I am?  Toby N. Tyler. My friends call me TNT. You know why?
Cause Im just like dynamite.  And when I go off somebody gets hurt.
Stand up Mister or Ill beat you where you sit.
I wasnt sneaking around with your girl.  Would you please tell him?
You stupid punk  You dont even know what youre fighting over
Im leaving.  You never have to see me again.  Just please give me the ticket
With a shotgun.  It kills him and it shreads the money.  I mean what are the odds?
Yes Mr. Vesci.
Maybe not for you Sheriff but I think Ive had my fill of your little town.
Shut up  The both of you.  Aint neither one of you too smart. Especially you boy.  Dont you think I had my eye on you since first you rolled into town?  You smell like trouble.  Stink of it like a ripe cesspool.
Eh?
But Senor
You want something?
You cant do that yourself?
Im sorry I didnt
I dont know.  I thought you were keeping the sun out of your eyes.
All right old man.  Christ.
I hope you wasnt pettin him none was you?
Hes only just dead.  What was I supposed to do with him?  I cant take him away anywhere.  And nobody wants to take him for me.  Do you?
So now youre going to tell me where I lost my eyes. You dont think I know where I lost my eyes? I was there when I lost them. I lost them in the war. The war in the joint. Theres always wars in the joint. Cause I was a code talker in the joint and in the war too. Mmmm nothing like the smell of a naked lady. Be careful boy.
So were all just floating along like twigs in a stream so enjoy the ride.  Is that it?
Oh shit
I wasnt sneaking around with your girl. Would you please tell him?
Give it to me
Who the hell are you?
You broke my nose
Bobby Cooper.
Thats the sweat of a man who hasnt an honest bone in his body.  Dont be offended lad.  A man whos got no ethics is a free man.  I envy that.  Beside how can I blame you?  That Grace sure has a mind of her own and a body to match dont she?  Eh?
Cant live with them and you cant shoot em.
How do you know if youve never tried?
I did?
Boy I think this heats getting to you the way youre rambling on.
Oh that was just loose talk. Husband gettin pissed off.  I dont want anybody dead.
A man doesnt always mean the things he says.
What makes you say that?
And what does that make you?
You want to do this yourself?  I dont have to do this you know.
No
Damn it Jake. There is a guy coming to kill me and if it comes down to me or Grace then I pick Grace.  You were going to give me thirteenthousand.  Give me twohundred.  Ill kill her and dump the body where no one will ever find it. She showed me the perfect place. There wont be enough left for an autopsy.  But I need the the money.  Ive got to have the money.
What are you talking about
Twohundred dollars...Ill do it  Ill kill her
Youre too quick for me.
Somewhere else?  Mister somewhere else is fifty miles from here. Only other gas station down in town closed 3 years ago when the mine got shut...
Yeah I can fix it.
You got to be more careful. Hands is important.  Let me show you something. When I was a kid now I dont know if you can still see it but I gashed my fingers in a lawnmower.
Diner up a piece.  Not much but us simple folk like it.
Dont look like nothing.
Another accident?  You got to be more careful.
About an hour and a half because thats all the longer Ive been gone.
Yeah well Ive been around the bend a bit.
You believe that?
You said this morning the hose was going to run me onefifty.
What reputation?  Youre nothing but an ignorant inbred tumbleweed hick.
Eh?
No trouble at all really.
Oh this isnt my car.  Its down a ways. I should have parked closer.  I just didnt think it would be so heavy.  I could drive up.
I dont know.  I have to make a stop in Vegas.  Business to finish.  Then maybe Ill head to Santa Barbara.  I might be able to pick up some action there.
Cooper. Bobby Cooper. Oh you know whatever pays best. Little bartending used to teach tennis played a little competition ... .
Good cause I liked what I saw.
From my father.  He was the tribes shaman.
Really?  And what game did you want to play?  You carry my box for me and I fall into bed with you?
No.
Depends on what you call love. I grew up on a reservation. A patch of desert in the middle of nowhere. Thats where they stick Indians Bobby. Thats where they leave us to die. My brother killed himself when he was 19 cause he couldnt take it anymore. Theres no hope there... Jake was my ticket out. Mom and me.
Yeah I guess youre right.
Im still here arent I?  See this?
Walk away.
If the keys on him how do we get the key?
After dark.  Ill leave the back door unlocked.
He was in love with you Grace. He wouldve done what you wanted you couldve made a deal and ...
Let it go baby. Its the past. I got a past...
But we all need that too. Hold him.
Son.  Little excitement out at the reservation this morning. Wayne and Dale Elkhart were up drinking all night and then Wayne starts chasing Dale around the desert with his shotgun. BIA handled it. I went by for backup.
Harlins.
And thats not the half of it Mr. Arkadin...
How much?
The ticket is 30.55.
Nothing Jake.  Absolutely nothing.
Oh no Oh please forgive me Papa
Shhhh Just like your Mama always scared of things...
Aw Toby we werent doing nothing.  We was just talking.
Ask if he can check how many sick days Ive taken since Ive worked here?
Yes.
Four.
I dont want to drag this out too long for Jeremy.
Hes asleep.
I havent been sick this year. I know that.
Thats strange isnt it? Not remembering one fever... Or a cold... Or a sore throat. What do you think that means?
No thats it.
My name is Megan Inverso. We went to college together.
Jesus.
Think carefully?
Seventyfive percent.
In college. A car accident.
Is there a problem?
Yes he is.
I want to sleep here tonight.
I wont make any noise.
How much can you lift?
Thats great.
Jeremy if you pull that trigger Im going to leave Im going to go to New York.
Fine.
How long have you been married?
Any way fate stepped in and took football out of the equation.
Im not going out anymore. Im not getting hurt again. This was the last time. I told you.
Where is it?
What did you think they come clear up from Kansas to fuck us?
Dont matter. They burned the table in 78 for firewood.
Nope.
You dont look nothin like me mister.

Yeah I guess.  Theres still a payment aint there?
Shit and fried eggs.

Whats your name?
Deserve dont mean shit Little Bill.
Duck I says.  You have insulted the honor of this beautiful woman Corcoran said the duck. You must apologize. But Two Gun Corcoran would have none of it and cursing he reached for his pistols and would have killed them but The Duck was faster and hot lead blazed from his smoking sixguns. 
He will be hurryin and he will miss. That there is as fast as I can pull an aim an hit anythin moren ten feet away... unless its a barn.

Did you... kill him?
Maybe you should... hang the carpenter.
Uh... hang the... uh... carpenter. I...
No he aint. He went South yesterday.
Nobody didnt kill Ned he went South yesterday. He didnt even kill nobody. Why would anybody kill Ned?
Nno. He... he beat him up. He was making him... answer questions... and beating him up... and then... Ned just died.  Little Bill didnt mean to kill him... he said he was sorry an all... but he said it was a good example anyhow.
About where you an him  was... an where you was from... an what your names was... an...
Llies... at first. About how you was just passin through and didnt kill nobody... an Little Bill kept askin questions mixin him up catchin lies... an then hed beat on Ned an Ned would cry and lie some more an then... then...
On account of my Schofield model Smith and Wesson pistol.
Well how about it?
Wasnt nothin said about no partner.
I was gonna kill them two by myself. It dont take three.
Lookin at?
He aint dead? You didnt get him?
You missed him? You didnt...?
You aint shot.
Huh?
Two weeks I guess.
How far kin you see?
Not for me. I dont touch it no more.
What he was talkin about... how them deputies had the drop on you an Pete...
You still think itll be easy shootin them cowboys?
We got to kill this other one first.  Shit Ned if were lucky we could kill him by nightfall... or maybe tomorrow morning. Then we could head back all three of us with the money.
Hes blind for Chri...
Yeah.
How many you killed Kid?
We dont need him. The two of us could do it.
Maybe.
Well bury him.
Yeah?
They tell me you got the cripple from New York in there. He mention Keyser Soze
Bear with me here...
And ?
ltltIll tell you everything. I11 even say it slow enough for you to understand it. Just tell this man I want protection. Real protection.gtgt
Theyll never stop.
Alright.
This whole thing was a shakedown.
Then who goes?
The way I hear it Soze is some kind of butcher. No pity.
What do you care what he says?
I walked. Ninety days suspended.
Verb  Roger this is Edie Finneran. Edie this is Roger Kint he was at
McManus has a friend in the Fourteenth Precinct. Theyre coming out for one job  Thursday. Theyre picking up a guy smuggling emeralds out of South America. Fenster and McManus have a fence set to take the stuff.
You okay?
Well Im sorry.
Not if we do it my way.
Something  I dont know.  I ever tell you about the restaurant I wanted to open?
Whos Keyser Soze?
Dont jerk me off. We all know what this is. You dont work with me if I work with you without knowing who Im working for. Now lets cut the shit. Whos the man?
Youre lying.
The D.A. came down here last night ready to arraign before they even moved him to county. Kints lawyer comes in and five minutes later the D.A. comes out looking like hed been bitchslapped by the boogey man. They took his statement and cut him a deal.
Someplace else then.
If it was a dope deal wheres the dope if it was a hit who called it in?
I dont think he does. Not exactly but theres a lot more to his story. I want to know why twentyseven men died on that pier for what looks to be ninetyone million dollars worth of dope that wasnt there. Above all I want to be sure that Dean Keaton is dead.
I told the D.A. everything I know.
Keaton was a piece of shit.
What lawyer?
Turn states evidence. Take the stand on this and well hear it out.
This is totally irrelevant.
Give a guy a break huh?
McManus was furious. He was talking about tracking him down and ripping his heart out and all sorts of shit. That night we got the call.
Kobayashi told us where we could find Fenster.
But Keaton...
Because he was my friend.
THE KIND OF MAN THAT COULD HAVE KILLED EDIE FINNERAN.
The district attorneys office will comply provided 
Then prosecute. I will be very impressed to see if the District Attorney manages to bring in twentyseven simultaneous counts of murder against one man with cerebral palsy. I would think a man with your job would agree with these alleged quotfaceless people in City Hallquot you mention.
Nothing.
Accused.  Not indicted.  He resigned the firm.  Divorced nineteen seventy.  Galvin worked with Michael Morrissey until Morrissey retired in seventyeight.  Since then hes been on his own.  Four cases before the Circuit Court.  He lost them all.  He drinks.
... yes.  Get her on the phone ...
... a Mrs. Doneghy called ... I told you that.
I was her doctor.
...I was one of a group of...
Why wasnt she getting oxygen...?
Just as you are Sir...
Sir.  Yes.  When a thing is wrong...as in this case I am available.  I am seventyfour years old I am not boardcertified.  I have been practicing medicine for fortysix years and I know when an injustice has been done.
Nothing further your Honor.
You may step down.
...one moment Mr. Concannon...
Thank you your Honor.  Further Ms. Costello is a rebuttal witness. As a Surprise Witness she may only serve to rebut direct testimony.  As her only evidentiary rebuttal was the admitting form which has been disallowed I request that her entire testimony be disallowed and the jury advised that they must totally disregard her appearance here.
I...
Youve just said you signed it.
After after the operation when that poor girl she went in a coma. Dr. Towler called me in.  He told me he had five difficult deliveries in a row and he was tired and he never looked at the admittance form.    And he told me to change the form.  He told me to change the one to a nine.   Or else or else he said...  He said hed fire me.  He said Id never work again....Who were these men...? Who were these men...?  I wanted to be  a nurse...
Hold on a second.
Easthampton Hospital for Women. Excuse me what is that a joke? Let me tell you something Doctor those men at Catherine Laboure. Men who are known not only in this city but the world were trying to save a womans life.  They were there and here you are four years later read some hospital report and say...
The Doctors were not negligent.
From what Ive seen Mr. Galvin you have a very good case...
Cardiac arrest.  During delivery her heart stopped.  When the heart stops the brains deprived of oxygen.  You get brain damage. That is why shes in the state shes in today.
Its my opinion it took him much longer.  Nine...ten minutes. Theres too much brain damage.
Yes.
Youre going to settle out of court?
Why?
Her doctors killed her.
I understand.
Who says that Im protecting anyone?
Why is that?
I wasnt disbarred they dropped the pro...
That happens.
I dont have a week.  This case never should have come to trial. You know better.  Youre Mr. Independent.  You want to be independent?  Be independent now. Ive got no sympathy for you.
Thank you your Honor Ill continue.  Dr. Thompson.  Did you examine Deborah Ann Kaye last night at The Northern Chronic Care Facility?
What?
If I may be permitted to question my own witness in my own way...
No no you listen to me.  All I wanted in this case is an even shake.  You rushed me into court in five days...my star witness disappears I cant get a continuance and I dont give a damn.  Im going up there and Im going to try it.  Let the Jury decide.  They told me Sweeney hes a hardass hes a defendants judge.  I dont care.  I said the hell with it.  The hell with it. Ill take my chances hell be fair.
Let me talk to Mickey.
Kathy Price.
Yes.  It was actually.
And are they going to get it?
Ive got to work.
Who told you that?
Is there going to be a later...?
If I dont grow up...
Hes...you cant reach him Sir. Hes in the on some island in the Caribbean they dont have a phone.   Hell be back in a week...  If youd like Dr. Halperns number...
What do you want?
Forget it.  You cant prove it. Sisters testimony is no good. Jury knows we win she gets the cash.
...Grubers not bad.GALVIN Not bad...?  This guys Dr. Kildare the jurys going to love him Mick...  And you calm down all right?  Their guy Towlers the author of the book  Methodology and Practice Anesthesiology.  ...and they got depositions from the nurses everybody in the operating room the scrubnurse...All these guys are God.  I saw them walk on water...
Right.
Right.
So what...?  The best is yet to come.  Check the TV Guide.  They got our Dr. Towler on a panel on GBH on Friday The Healing Hand. The Experts Speak.
So what do you want me to do? Concannons going to try the case his way Im going to try it mine. You want me to go wee wee wee all the time because hes got some flack got stories in the newspaper. Im going to win this case.
I think we tried that.  The case is over.
All right.  Who wasnt in the O.R.?
Hello.  This is Mr. Dorchester in Records.  Were looking for Kathy Costello...
But what can we do?  She dont know whos visiting her ...
My doctor told me that I got to move out West ... thats when we filed in court.  We didnt want to sue ...

Where had you been before?
John. Old friends. Acquaintances call me Scottie.

Some people prefer it.

Youve nothing to apologize for.
I enjoyed talking to you.

And so explain it away?  But there is a way to explain it you see. If Im mad? That would explain it wouldnt it?
Im here Ive got you...

Byebye
Oh?
All I said in the note was Where are you? That doesnt sound desperate to me.
Oh... this and that.
Good. Ive always said you were wasting your time in the underwear department.
What does a big old wooden house on the corner of Eddy and Gough Street have to do with her?
How?
Excellent.

Because my opinion threatens yours its poorly developed?
Franco motherfucking Harris
Why was the floor wet?
Dont you fucking threaten me  Ill fucking kill you.
Over eight years of some of the hardest raging experiences of my life.
Nobody knows shes here. I called her personally. Nobody knows.

Or a stock kick of approximately 125 on shares which are currently sitting around 4.38 or in plain English...
Well we can definitely call the police. Thats an easy call. If we call the police...What happens?  They find a dead prostitute in the bathroom...They ask us...What happened? We say ah...our friend Micheal...  Your brother...got a little out of control...they were making love...and he got a little excited...and he ah sort of beat her head into the side of a toilet while he choked her to death with a rubber hose...
You always were a jealous man.
What did you ask me?
Does she sound pissed scared hostile? Did she mention the police?
Yeah.
Now?
Youve got a warped thought process. Your brain doesnt function properly.
Fine? Fine what?
You said one in two marriages end in divorce.
Oh really? Starbucks?
And what happens when you cant?
Israel doesnt have a King.
Whats your point?
The Israelis can protect themselves. They got the Mossad thing happening. Mossads for real man. They scalp babies.
They need leadership.
You said nobody would miss her.
You will not screw this up.
Micheal get a grip.  What did you tell her?
We missed the deadline.
Sent it.
You know how important this is to my mother. You know that.
Im just saying I bet those checks all found the mailboxes.
It amazes me how organized you and your little fun bunch can be when it comes time to mobilize to Vegas.
David Boyd is a big sack of hot gas.

To tell you the truth not very much. I cannot lie. I respect you and I am grateful to you because I owe you everything materially but otherwise ...
In twenty years the grass has invaded everything. There are spiders all over the house except on the first floor. I hardly ever go out.
You are spoiling me too much. I wont know what to do with myself when youve gone.
Evil.
Today I can refuse you nothing.
You must be out of your mind. Ive been so happy these last few days  now youve spoiled it all.
I have asked her but shes ungrateful. Sometimes I feel like hitting her. When I talk to her about the convent she turns to stone.
Speak to her again. Explain everything to her seriously.
Its only that ... Its all very odd sir.
Do you have great devotion for the Virgin?
Why do you say that? Perhaps the young girl is a bit jealous.
Run and get something to mop it up with quickly.
I think Id better go tomorrow.
Theres plenty of money in this house. Piles of it.
Wheres the dough?
Why did he kill himself?

He couldnt get through the door then?
Yes
Ive discovered something about Lindenmeyer5 Maestro teaching tool I thought you should know...  The harm done to the music students who used the device  it was not by accident. The machine was designed explicitly for that purpose. Lindenmeyer intended to hurt the kids using it.
Madison lives two blocks from their present location.
I dont know.
Whyd.. .you pull me out?

Parker Barnes Id like you to meet Crime Czar Elizabeth Deane.
If you can catch him.
You sonofabitch. How could you let them put the implant in my head? How?
I think we both know who did.  Whats so urgent?
We have an emergency situation which requires somebody with expertise in criminal psychology. Under the authority vested in me by the President Im giving you temporary reassignment.
Youre going to put your theories to practice. Im sending you into the field.
I was assured the problem was corrected.
Neither will the public.  The media has caught wind of his pardon. Unless Mr. Barnes starts giving me some tangible results Im going to put him back in his cage.
This is supposed to be years away.
Show me his physical sensory level.
Then fix it.
True genius is rarely rewarded within its lifetime.
It was me what?
What was going through your mind when you killed the busboy?
I dont have to do anything except survive. And its taking everything Ive got just to do that.
Fine. Never felt better in my life.  See Im a good liar.
Charlie? You say that like youre close personal friends.
Maybe after they catch him you should write a book about him...
Just like they figured there was no better person to catch one...
How did you get your hand out?
I prefer keeping my professional life separate from my personal life.
Thankyou.  Her name is Karin.
I told you it was on the way and I wanted to change clothes.
I ruin so many moments by analyzing them when I should just be living them.

Sut McKinley.  Marry me.
You really love this guy...?
Is that a crack about our singing...?
Papers...?
The one on the left  definitely...
Yes it is...
Then we would have to call in our locksmith to break the lock
I didnt say that  Im sure it could be but our clients must sign in first checking signatures and a photo ident  we had a nasty theft two years ago and weve been very strict since then.
No its no problem  I do it all the time
Yes  I have had it for years.
Sure...
my car  I stopped working from my car.  She could have stopped me you know  If she really wanted too. That is the difference between the confusion of humanity and the purity of the beast  If a dog attacked you  you could easily kill it without any damage to yourself  Why then do people get bitten by dogs  savaged? Why?
You know everyone accuses me of being sick  the press the TV  but Im not you know  they are  I dont watch it for entertainment every night  I dont sit and watch it whilst eating my dinner  they all say how could he cut her up? She was dead  I cant hurt something dead  And all this whilst they slobber down their processed beef burgers by the dozen  I couldnt eat one of those burgers you dont know what has gone in them 
I have something I have to show you...
It seemed like a good idea at the time  why did you marry your husband.
I dont think so...This isnt a game you know...There arent points or leagues. Sure I killed my husband  but I am no killer.
Did you?
STEPHANIE?
I know this sounds insane ELLEN but... Telling you all of this writing the book... It feels good. Dont get me wrong  I feel like a weight is being lifted from my shoulders... When I tell you what I have done  I cant believe it is me...Yet I know it was. This is like a purging for me...
You want me to wear white for you? You must be madder than I thought...
But for how long  what will set you off again? Youll be walking down the street and some girl will be wearing a white hat  and that will be it  back on the merry go round...
No thanks  
Why whats wrong with the sugar 
I would prefer it if you kept away from LESLIE
Yes I can...
No he had to  hes just  hes out...
Get out...
Id really like it if you would come round some time  Then I could cook you a meal  what do you say...
Poor Freud turning in his grave.
Cut it out before you break something
Id kiss your mother with this mouth. I mean if she wasnt you know...
Yeah hes probably been serving cocktails SO TO SPEAK at the orgies.
It better not be my Aunt Trudy.
We wanted to challenge the notions of classic beauty. We wanted to showcase women throughout the world.
This is a fun place...but we dont usually come here until after the orgies.
Oh god.  Look. Look.
These are real live women?
He kicked major ass and you know it.
From your lips to Gods ears.
Yeah?
Yeah?
SHUT UP  Are you serious? Of course I will...of course.
So youll think about it?
So thats a maybe?
I do? I mean yeah I do.
Come on I was hamburger. You were porterhouse.
Then you better get in the water before you get burned.
We own a small family grocery store.
We miss you. We miss our son.
Dad please.
Remember how you struggled through that whole facts of life talk and then found out I knew more than you?
Well why should I?
Like one of those National Geographic specials with the topless chicks?
I guess its better than having tribal patterns carved in my face.
Just say it Dad.
Consider me your fairy godfather except without the fairy part. No more mealy apples and bruised bananas ever for the rest of your lives.
Shopping really? I should tell my friend.
Hi ho Silver.
I always knew there was more. I felt it.
Whatever you want.
What do you want me to do?
I understand.
But how can you respect yourself if you dont?
I see so youd be open to little ladies from Pasadena who want to show you their knickers?
She knew exactly where you were staying which you neglected to tell me your own brother.
You can have it then. Im not going back there.
Funny you should say that. My Grandfather was a peach farmer.
I didnt forget.
From my wise albeit youthful vantage point the world is your oyster. You scored big.
But you tripledogdared me.
Your article sucked.
In the sense that there is no hidden agenda behind a bake sale that raised five hundred dollars for seeing eye dogs.
Thats not ENTIRELY true.
Could everybody else tell you were different or were you the only one who knew?
I see. So more like a tight rope walker who secretly wants to be a trapeze artist.
You never know around here.
I did my homework. Your grandfather was a peach farmer.
I bet there are lots and lots of mirrors on Planet Ted.
Youve got enough people kissing your ass.
Put your eyeballs back in your head William Randolph. Im on assignment. A girl has to fit in.
Eventually youll let go.
But you never do.
Then you wont mind covering that watermelon seed spitting contest next week...
My desire betrays me like goosebumps on my flesh.
Wearing them?  Or humping them?
Thats refreshingly deviant.
You live and learn. I realized the most important thing to me above all is trust.
Aw Julie its my job. Its like being a doctor.
Did you have a nice flight?  Are they taking good care of you?
What is all this? When are you coming home?
Only the best for my mother.
Oh Teddy. We missed you so much.
Dont say shit honey. Use the strong vocabulary God gave you.
Yes sir. Ill brace myself.
Are you kidding? This magazine is my dream. Its every redblooded heterosexual males dream.
Deaf ears Mr. Nelson. I answer to a higher power.
A new pediatric wing at the hospital? A presidential campaign? Name it. Anything.
Of course I like girls.
As much as possible.
Indeed it is. During the day visitors prefer to be outside au naturel. As it were.
YOU? Nervous? Why on earth should you be nervous?
Huh You laugh in the face of pressure
You are a multimedia magnate. The Tycoon of Tits. The Baron of Bottoms.
Me? The King of Coitus?
You think we should be more open minded?
In other words our scope is too narrow.
Really? So Im doing OK?
Seriously? Im doing all right?
Weve got a huge problem with the magazine Tedbaby. Our readers hate it. HATE IT. We need to talk.
All is fair in Heaven Tedbaby.
Well kid Im speaking of...your biological parents.
Its spring break. I dont want to go to a will reading.
Thats great.  Ill just tell my creditors Im not a rapist.  No problem... Shit.  I cant believe the boards going to act without even hearing my side of it.
Kelly.
Senior class fundraising gig.  I told em they could hose down the Jeep.  Hey come on.  Its for a good cause.
What about the blood?
And the child...
I understand.
He kept saying Let it happen let it happen.  Then he just stopped.
She didnt cone home last night.  We found her car at the bus terminal but nothing to suggest she bought a ticket.
Ray thinks she was murdered.
Back to the land of grownups.
Hunters making it our job because Sandra Van Ryans got a bug up his ass. You know that as well as I do.  Were gonna trash this guys life and I keep asking myself if its really necessary.
Yeah well Van Ryan got his.  I dont imagine he gives a shit now.
The skinny brunette.
Maybe Lombardos attorney was saving the affair for the trial.
What?  You wouldnt go after some guy you thought raped your daughter?  Cone on.  She bought the same story we did...
Ray.  We dont know anything yet.  She could be anywhere...
You have someplace to be?
Just check out the car.
Those are Suzie Tollers teeth.
We dont know that Ray...
Wheres Lombardo?
He dropped Jimmy off first?
So you were alone.
You know what that will mean for Lombardo.
The line I get on this guy is that hes done half the women in Blue Bay.
I dont believe Im hearing this.  A month ago you were pulling these two apart at the courthouse.  They were acting.  They were all acting from the beginning.  And we bought it hook line and sinker... And now theyre home free with six million of Sandra Van Ryans money.
You didnt cuff her?
Im sorry... you said it hurt?  Why?
I said he did.
No
Yeah but...
Yeah but he cant push you around like he can me.  Youve got family and theyve got clout.  With we its different... with me...
What brain?
Hi Mon.
Whichever one I want.
I miss Dad.
Where the mall?
Mr. Lombardo.  Were running kind of late.  How about if Nicole goes on to the Mansons?  You could give me a ride when you find the ticket.
Why cant you come...
You think thats wise?
Thats cop bullshit.
About what?
Is this supposed to mean something to me?  What triangle?
I dont have to listen to this.  And you cant shove me around.  I have friends now...
Shoulda coulda woulda...  Get him in the water.
But you cant tell us what she wanted to talk about.
It is and I dont.  Ordinarily...  But I mean... theres this kid standing in front of you crying...
The bitch shot me is what happened.
Yes we call it a winch.  And these are shrouds and these are stays.
Shut up.  Dont fall apart.  The only people who can blow this is us. Remember?
Good.  Just keep telling yourselves that the only people who can fuck this up is us.
But then it is better this way dont you think?  No loose ends.
Cant.  Got a passenger.
What?  Running over alligators with that silly swamp jalopy when you could be sailing a real boat...
Goodbye Sandra.
You need that real often?
All right if itll make you happy Ill try that.
Is this leading somewhere?
Prepare what?
Whoa Jim.  Maybe.  But we cant arrest this little pillar of society on maybe.
That?  Oh its a kind of Chinese fighting... I was sort of caught once with a lovely Chinese girl out in San Francisco.  Her big brothers were kind enough to teach it to me  Ive got a book on it if youre interested.
At least the things not that fast. We just follow it.  Whenever it stops were there waiting.
No Im not all right.  They got away.  And we cant even follow them.  They can get off the tracks anywhere they want.
Nothing much to it really.  When I was younger I got into a pretty bad runin with the Wyler Boys.  I saw them coming.  But I didnt act fast enough.  Secondguessed myself. And it cost me... cost me dearly.
Those kids they took my wagon. Never got it back.
I thought all you needed were your fists and your gun.
I find most criminals slip up somewhere...
Youd think if Loveless is going to kill him he could at least be a prominent citizen.
Sounds like a train.  Looks like a train.
You said it popped out too easily. Nothings ever good enough for you is it?
Oh no we split him fiftyfifty.
What?  President Grant is...
I dont have to tell you what that would do to our careers
Id love to stop him but have you noticed the hundred armed men?
Well hell maybe we do have a chance.
Of course not.
What is this?  A whole new train?
Like hell  Ill see it through Ram the bastard
I dont recollect ever being compared to a pistol before.
Well I owe you one dont I?
You tell me.
Ive had some practice.
Fine Ill stop.
Well Captain then the answer is your train is still here.
A mistake?  To assign this case to the man who blew up all the bridges on the Chattanooga River and single handedly trapped Jacksons entire cavalry?  How is that a mistake?
Thatll be all boys.
On my way to Denver...
Talk?  About what...?  Oh  About who you are and all that?
Dr. Loveless?
That would be... the Mexican War?
A glass eye?  Thats who it was OneEyed Jack Garrison.  Otherwise known as General Garrison Confederate Third Army.  I saw him at Dr. Loveless party but I couldnt place him.  He used to wear an eyepatch.
Its a smelting retort.
You dont know what hes built? Surely you dont think he kidnapped all those geniuses to have them make something as rudimentary as this.
Theyre coming.
Right.
He thought you were a woman Airk
She belongs to all of us.  She is the future queen and ruler of all kingdoms on earth.
No Im not.  Have you really looked at me?  Im short  Even for a Nelwyn
Anything you hurl them at will turn to stone.
No.  I mean yes.
Let me see it.
Too bad youre not more like your father.
I dont believe you.
Good.  How long will it take?
Are you okay?
These burns.  My arms.  Ouch...
I hate this.
I will.
Of course  I promise
Where the hell did you come from?
Because shes sick.
Youre crazy.  I think youre in love.
Ahhh
Willow this is war not agricul ture
Madmartigan you promised me youd take care of Elora Danan like your own daughter.  She is all that matters.  Are you going to abandon her?
Absolutely not.
Daikinis are giant people who live far far away.
Im Willow Ufgood.  Im here to find Fin Raziel.
I cant remember all these things. What am I learning?
Why?
Me neither
Us??  Well never catch them.  Any way were all done Teemo.  Lets go home.
Shut up.
No  You let us handle this.  Come along Rool
How do these work I wonder?  I got ta save one to show the High Aldwin.
Without Raziel well never find Tir Asleen.  Wed better go.
Guess Im not used to so much.
Pretty much.
Pick up the hat.
No pistol. Ever.
You dont say.
...I want to say a thing.
I wont. Now run.  Fast as you can
Zenovitch was about to deliver a list of names tonight  street chemists... the guys processing this P2P into speed.
The Amish boy saw him Paul. Ill make it but Set Donahue and the Homicide Department off my back or theyll blow the whole thing.
Well anyway dont get crazy.  Ill do something for Zenovichs wife.
A hot shower... I havent changed clothes in two days.
Just us.
Dont try me Johnny
Yes I do. Your son is a material witness to a homicide.
He wants to know who you are. Your name. I told him we dont need to know anything about you.
The problem is I dont happen to think my son should be spending all his time with a man who carried a gun under his coat and goes around whacking people.
Oh yes. She thinks you like policing because you think youre right about everything. And youre the only one who can do anything. And that when you drink a lot of beer you say things like none of the other police would know a crook from a... um... bag of elbows.
The leadership of our district... the diener. Bishop Tschantz is the one with no hair on top. They decided to come and see you for themselves. Except Stoltzfus of course. He came the first day. I think he saved your life.
But you cant.
Nobody meant any harm. The boy was curious. I unloaded the gun 
Very interesting. Im learning a lot about manure.  Whats that?
I can whack people. Im hell at whacking.
But... You may not be well enough.
Arent you? After today?
Land Are you crazy? Im no Amishman and Im no farmer Im a cop. Thats what I know and thats what I do
Wheres my baggy pants?
I didnt even know about it.
Johnny what the fuck?
Listen Johnny dont do anything stupid. You couldnt get within a mile of Schaeffer right now. So stay put... Stay in touch  Ill let you know when maybe it makes sense.
Say again?
I admit I dont know where he is.
What I know Paul is...  Hes going to take you out...
Fred. The way he looked when you screamed at him.
I have committed no sin.
Yes. Samuel Were going.
My son is out there
Fiftyseven fiftyeight 
Oh but he doesnt do it every day  just once or twice a week.  And he cant catch her old cat anyway. And now she says shes gonna get the sheriff and 
You wicked old witch  Uncle Henry Auntie Em dont let em take Toto  Dont let her take him  please
Dorothy.  Dorothy dear. Its Aunt Em darling.
There there lie quiet now.  You just had a bad dream.
Oh I hope we got them in time.
Now we cant go against the law Dorothy. Im afraid poor Toto will have to go.
I saw you tinkering with that contraption Hickory. Now you and Hunk get back to that wagon
Well dont start posing for it now.  Here here  cant work on an empty stomach. Have some crullers.
But weve got to verify it legally To see...
If any
Tap  tap  tap  tap  What was that  that  that? Our echo  echo  echo.
I dont believe you
Oh ....
Ohhh
This?
Hickory
All in good time my little pretty  all in good time.
Thats a good little girl.  I knew youd see reason.
That was her sister  the Wicked Witch of the East. This is the Wicked Witch of the West.  And shes worse than the other one was.
Oh Id give anything to get out of Oz altogether  but which is the way back to Kansas?  I cant go the way I came.
The Wizard of Oz?  Is he good or is he wicked?
Whenever you wish.
Theres no place like home.  Theres no place like home.  Theres no place like home.  Theres no place like home.
Nobody cares about me at home. They wouldnt even miss me.
My mouth  my mouth
...Oh did that hurt?
Well youre perfect now.
Im afraid Im a little rusty yet.
Oh 
Dont you know the Wizards going to give you some courage?
Lions and tigers and bears
Yes.
And  and I got a permanent just for the occasion.
Not nobody not nohow
Why Id thrash him from top to bottomamus
Oh well then  well ask him for you.
No but its wonderful for threatening with.
Did they hurtcha?
Stay with us then Dorothy.  We all love you.  We dont want you to go.
Whats the matter  gonna let a little old pig make a coward out of you?
Oh well here  let me help you.
Ohhhh 
Oh  Oh  Ohhh
No No  I  I just thought you hurt yourself.
But Id face a whole box full of them for the chance of getting some brains.  Look  I wont be any trouble because I dont eat a thing  and I wont try to manage things because I cant think.  Wont you take me with you?
Come along Dorothy  you dont want any of those apples.  Hmm
I dont see how.  You werent around when I was stuffed and sewn together were you?

Dorothy You cant sleep here You cant sleep in the middle of a field
Imposserous

Not nohow
Dorothy?  Well what has Dorothy done?
We do.
A heart 
Its the Wicked Witch  Whatll we do? Help  HELP
I havent got a heart But I got a palpitation.
Now now dont fret.
I dont know what wed have done without you.
Go on
Well I 
Th.D.?
Help
Couldnt make it. Splitting headache.
So who are you?
I did kill us. She thinks were dead. And she thinks she got away with it.
Not just nuclear. Powered by a nuclear reactor.  Hes not loading any cargo. They want the sub. The sub itself. Put weapons grade plutonium inside the subs reactor Instant catastrophic meltdown.
We go down to the torpedo bay.
Hes going to insert the plutonium.
But what if...
I need you to pass me fit now Molly.
The doctor who saved him couldnt get it out so Renard killed him. When Interpol found the xrays there was mild jubilation. Effectively hes a dead man.
Hes not through yet. Renard doesnt blow up five million dollars unless he knows theres more coming in. Hes working for someone. Someone who wants to stop the pipeline.  And they hired the perfect killer. One with a vendetta against King...and you.
The worm on the hook again.
Your last chance. Give me the name.
Not many people in this world have that kind of fortune.
You even brought the plane for us.  We really couldnt have done it without you.
Funerals arent exactly memorable.
Its my fathers pin. He wore it everyday of his life.
Its not the pin your father wore. Its an exact duplicate. Inside is a tiny electrical detonator. We have reason to believe the assassin had an inside accomplice someone who worked at this company.
You are wrong Mr. Bond. In fact I am the only person who can do it.
I know.
Two. Shaken not stirred.
Someone wants to kill me Id rather die looking him straight in the eye.  What are you doing here?  Looking for a woman a little more your type? How about that one?
You had your chance James. Now Im looking for a bigger thrill.
Not at that price. Time to surrender.
You turned Renard.
Oh James.
Shes no innocent.  This is my nuclear consultant.
A rope
This is a family matter If my nephew is in danger we do it my way or nothing Now get me out
The right kind of explosion in the right spot  it would block the Bosphorus cut off the Black Sea.
What class sub does your nephew run?
Someone will come.
Yes.  Au revoir...
And expensive.  Cost three million plus.
Anywhere in this circle.  Iran Iraq Pakistan Syria Afghanistan...
Still no contact yet.
Laurie Ill have to ask you to come with me.
The weather.  I see.  Keep me posted.  I want hourly forecasts and a full report on optimum strike conditions.
Small army from the looks of it.  He put up one hell of a fight.
Dont call me that.
Why doctor.  I did.  He was a bad dog.
Saw the world that night  random empty hideous.  God didnt make it that way.  We did.  We make the world  in our own image.  What else can I illuminate?
Jon  Get back  You dont understand.
Yes.  I heard this morning.  Washingtons asked me to attend the funeral as a matter of protocol.
Space and time.  I finally understand Laurie.  I see it all now.
Dan are you really that paranoid?  Lets face it Eddie Blake was no Mother Teresa.
Oh yeah.  The one that used to confess to everything?  Hoping wed beat him up?
Oh yeah.  They gave me a clean bill of health and then booted me the hell out.  No expense account.  No place to live.
No screw that.  What you were saying before its absolutely right.   Id love to have you stay.
The Comedian . . . Jon . . . now Rorschach.
One more down.  Someone tried to kill Adrian.  . . . First time Ive ever heard him scared.
I know what youre thinking.  Youd be a lot safer if I werent around.
 I thought it was time for a routine maintenance check.
Would you want to sit out a war?  I mean  what would be left.
What are you up to?
That Detroit shit?  Im so worried.
The costumes.  Am I right?
Thats because 
What now?  Fly south  hook up with Adrian?
Did anybody follow you?  See you come here?
Blake investigating missing scientists for CTU.  Dr. Manhattan somehow involved . . . 
Come on Rorschach.  Gimme a break 
Okay lets just . . . thank you.
The guidance systems fried.  I had to switch to manual.   Some kind of massive electromagnetic shockwave.
Dont know.  Nothing I can think of    outside of a nuclear blast.
Hes the one.  Hes been the one all along.  Stalking us.
Isnt it true that you 
Thats it.  This is all a trick isnt it?  Some kind of horrible joke to make me 
Am I free to go?
Jon??  You mean hes 
Worked both sides of the fence.  Ask your old buddies in the CTU.
No no.  You got it all wrong.  I been on the case Rorschach I got something for you.
Looks like a diner.
Good for you. Now why dont you stop wasting my time and tell me what you want. You didnt go through all this for my benefit.
You know what I hate? Any scumbag with a clean shirt and a bad haircut can get one of those tin stars and suddenly they think theyre God.
If you find out what I want to know and if Im able to successfully use that information you get to go back to your degenerate little life. If not you take a bath.
Fine but Im not gonna be no Bulldog Omega 5.
If youre trying to push my buttons youre on the right track. Dont make me question my own judgment X.
Yeah I sent you pictures. Heres what Im thinking. If they take out the cameras and sensors they could probably put a bomb in this thing. You drop it in the water in the Red Sea and three weeks later its swimming up the Potomac.
Im pretty happy to see me too. So are you done with me yet?
Youre a jerkoff you know that?
Not a whole helluva lot. His final transmission was mangled. About something or someone called Ahab. Whatever it is it cost him his life.
Theyre ruthless and they have a lot of firepower. Its only a matter of time before they figure out how to deploy Silent Night. Then were gonna have a catastrophe on our hands.
Oh I dont know. It was an accident.
You wanna check it out? Come here.
Oh. I bet by the end he gets something out of it.
Is she for real? Honey maybe you should quiet down and let the grownups have a conversation.
The eyes dont lie. All this has gotten to you hasnt it Petra? You came in as Yorgis girlfriend and you stayed because it was fun. Now you dont like it so much but youre in so deep you cant get out anymore. Tell me if Im wrong Petra.
Lets just say Im freelancing and leave it at that.
So there you have it. I guess you just have to ask yourself how bad to you want out?
If I go out the back hell know youve warned me.
I dont know. Eight months ago I stop hearing from my people. No explanation just silence. So I stay and I wait like I was told. Soon Im in so far theyd kill me if I left. Now every day I get farther and farther away from what I was. Im like you said a criminal.
I know which cops are good and which are bad. Come with me. Come on right now.
It doesnt matter anymore forget it.
Let me guess they had a big white torpedo with them.
I thought that was in detail.
You run around with maniacs jumping motorcycles in the desert you break 36 bones crashing wave runners and snowboarding off cliffs all with no health insurance... Its insane I cant take it anymore.
You have all this talent and you waste it. You wont take a single endorsement deal. Meanwhile those other guys have their own video games But no youve got too much integrity for that.
Well if youre bailing I guess Id better give you your surprise now.
I was gonna wait till the islands but...
Here we go again.
Yeah thanks a lot.
Whats the deal?
Why you dogging me up?
A parachute. This does not argue well.
Hes a pretty good actor though.
Its like you said every man for himself.
Looks like were in the middle of the drug war.
Itll work faster if I have an account number.
Im somewhat less so. We seem to have a bit of a problem...
Of course.
You wanna see my politics?
...try walking into a deli and urinating on the cheese. Anarchy Burger by the Vandals.
You an Army brat? I dont see that one at all. Did you join the service as well?
Thats alright Im kinda tired.
Dont forget goatee boy. I greased him up on the diamond run.
You think Im after money? I told you my friend. Anarchy. Time for a change. Money is good but for true freedom you have to get rid of the rules themselves.
Come on Xander. You used to stand for something. What happened to you man? I thought youd get it.
Oh just shoot us already. Im sorry I asked.
The neurofilter acts like a surge protector regulating the infinite flow of information from Cerebro to the Professors mind.  Its what keeps him from being crushed by the consciousness of millions.
We all do.
Im afraid without Cerebros help he wont have the strength to heal himself  And without the neuro filter... theres no Cerebro.
For what purpose?
His vital signs are weak and getting weaker.
Well I think thats perfectly understandable.
Whats that?
Into the Hudson?
Some cigars.  Case of beer.
Were you now?
Control Senator...  we teach them control.
This.  This whole God damn thing.  Making yourselves into some sort of team of superpowered freaks. Teaching wayward mutants about classical literature.  For what?
No.  Thats me talking.  And you know what?  Its only been thirtytwo hours and you still have no idea what this guy wants with me.
Actually Magneto helped me put it together.
We were friends once...  But that was a long time ago.
Theyre all asking how youre doing. Are you feeling up to saying hello to everyone?
What?... miss me?  Charley Im gonna walk out the front door and trust me it wont be soon enough for everyone here.
The sun is setting Logan.  Youve been asleep for nineteen hours.
How?
Not at the cost of lives Max.
What do you want with him?
Dr. Frederick Fronkonsteen.
Poppycock
Yes sir.  But I must have taken the wrong one when we came up.
Here  This cauliflower is useless to me.
What lecture could be more important than the will of Baron Beaufort Frankenstein?
Baack
MMMmmmm.
MMmmm.

Very....very
Goodbye darling.
Yes.  I am a bit tired after all.
Youve done everything thats humanly possible Frederick.  Oh darling Im so worried about you  you need rest.
Of course I am.  Now give me a kiss and say good night like my good boy.
This is the only library I know of.
I think you must be mistaken sir.
Will there be anything else?
This wire came while you were gone. Your fiancee will be arriving any moment.
A week.  Ten days at most.
But arent you the grandson of the famous Dr. Victor Frankenstein?... who performed such fascinating experiments in electricity and galvanism?
How old are you young man?
Im sure we will.
What?
What?
How I Did It.  Good title
Tonight?
Dont fall for that one.
You can say that again.
Youre just supposed to repeat what you said.
What did you find out?
Can you play it?

I like your style master.  How do we get him here?
Is everything ready?
MMMmmmm  MMMmmmm
Diffrent types who wear a day coat pants with stripes and cutaway coat perfect fits.........................
...Super duper. Come lets mix where Rock efellers walk with sticks or umber ellas in their mitts.........................
Its an honor for me sir.  You play the violin?
Thats quite all right.  What is it dear?
Yes  What could it be at this hour?
Well this explains the music.
I think youve done it master.

Oh no siree.  If yo dont have a reservation you can skip to maloo.
Franz  Help  Lunatic

One Zulu is only one man.. ..and Im afeared of no one man... but the Zulu they come in the thousands.... like a black wave of death.... in the thousands.... and them assegais.... stabbing
Zulu may not wear shoes or trousers and the like but it don t mean to say they got no brains. Theyll watch us  and wait  and find our weaknesses.
Excuse me My Lord.  NorrisNewman of The Standard My Lord.
